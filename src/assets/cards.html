The valuation effects of a stronger euro and a stronger ruble against the U.S. dollar further accentuated the growth of remittances in U.S. dollar terms. These effects more than compensated for the dampening of outbound remittance flows from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, in particular Saudi Arabia, due to fiscal tightening and policies discouraging the recruitment of foreign workers. (Greater details are given in the later section, Regional Trends in Migration and Remittance Flows.)</p><p>Provisional estimates indicate that <span class='card-underline'>remittance flows to Europe and Central Asia grew by 20.9 percent in 2017</span> (in U.S. dollar terms), <span class='card-underline'>after three consecutive years of decline</span>. Compared with 2016, in the first three quarters of 2017, the Russian ruble appreciated against the U.S. dollar (from Rub 68 to Rub 58 per dollar). As a result, outbound remittances from Russia (the main source of remittances to Central Asian countries) increased by 5 percent in ruble terms, and 21 percent in U.S. dollar terms (figure 1.2). The inverse relationship between a depreciation of the ruble against the U.S. dollar and the difference between U.S. dollar- and rubledenominated remittances is evident in the quarterly data since 2010.</p><p>In 2017, the top remittance receiving countries—in dollar terms—were India, China, the Philippines, Mexico, Nigeria, and Egypt (figure 1.3).

It is worth noting that economic growth in remittance-source countries of the global South (for example, Côte d’Ivoire, India, Malaysia, Russia, South Africa) impacts the flow of remittances, as does the growth of top migrant destinations in the global North.</p><p>The current, accelerated pace of global economic growth may continue due to a cyclical recovery in global manufacturing and investment, propelled by trade in goods. This is likely to hold if commodity prices remain steady, and global financial conditions remain supportive despite some tightening in monetary policy (World Bank, 2018a). The growth of advanced economies in 2018 is likely to continue at the same accelerated pace experienced in 2017. Growth picked up in the United States in 2017, helped by the broad-based strength of domestic demand, and the solid advance is expected to continue into 2018. In the euro area, growth picked up as well in 2017 and has remained strong thus far into 2018, supported by robust consumer demand, strengthening investment, and improved flow of bank credit. Russia’s growth recovered in 2017. Growth in the Europe and Central Asia region, as a whole, continues to benefit from betterthan-expected growth in the euro area. Growth in the Middle East and North Africa is likely to advance, thanks to an easing fiscal stance and stronger non-oil sector momentum. Latin America saw a pickup in growth supported by a cyclical recovery in Brazil and improving conditions in Chile, Colombia, and Peru. Developing East Asian countries’ growth is set to moderate in 2018 after accelerating in 2017, supported by robust domestic demand. Robust growth in South Asia mainly reflects strengthening growth in India as the effects of temporary policy driven disruptions (demonetization and a new tax on goods and services) fade. Regional growth in Sub-Saharan Africa is also expected to increase in 2018, reflecting continued recovery in Nigeria and South Africa and steady growth in the rest of the region.</p><p>Consistent with this global growth pattern, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>remittances to LMICs are expected to </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>grow</span></span><span class='card-underline'> at about </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>4</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.1 </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>percent in 2018, to $485 billion</span></span> (table 1.1).

Conventional wisdom argues that the relationship between migration and remittances is positive and reinforcing. The basic idea is that as the number of migrants in a host country in period one grows, the level of remittances sent to the home country will increase in period two. Likewise, as the level of remittances received in the home country increases in period two, the level of migration to the host country will increase in period three. These phenomena could be summarized in a nutshell as "more migration, more remittances".</p><p>Although there is substantial evidence to prove that this dynamic is true, we will argue in this paper that <span class='card-underline'>the relationship between migration and remittances is not always positive and could be negative</span> depending on demographic, banking and immigration policies that are seldom analyzed comprehensively by scholars or policy makers (some exceptions are Bauer and Sinning 2006, Cobb-Clark and Hildebrand 2002, Amuedo-Dorantes and Pozo 2002).</p><p>We will present evidence to show that <span class='card-underline'>an obvious factor molding the relationship between migration and remittances is the demographic composition of the migratory flow, which could be an unintended byproduct of immigration policies in host </span><span class='card-underline'>countries. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>A migration flow</span></span><span class='card-underline'> of children and women, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>following </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>family reunification</span></span><span class='card-underline'> policies, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>will</span></span> potentially <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>lead to a significant reduction of</span></span><span class='card-underline'> both the supply and demand of </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>remittances</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>. As families reunify</span></span><span class='card-underline'> in the host country, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>both the original and the new migrant will have fewer relatives to send</span></span><span class='card-underline'> their </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>remittances to</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. This will result in a counterintuitive dynamic: more migration, but fewer remittances.</span></p><p>An additional phenomenon is the openness of the banking system to non-citizens (including undocumented aliens) in host countries. This has a conflicting effect on remittances. On the one hand, the level of remittances received in the home country will increase as remitting costs from the host country decreases; this could be the case even if the level of remittances sent remains relatively constant. On the other hand, as the banking system opens up for migrants, it also becomes easier to save in the host country rather than to do so in the home country. This choice, along with family reunification, will transform remitters into savers.</p><p>In order to support our arguments we will analyze data from the Turkish and Polish migratory experience in Germany and from the case of Mexican migration to the United States.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we briefly discuss why people migrate and remit and we outline our argument. In Section II we present the opposing cases of Polish and Turkish migration to Germany, the former being a clear example of “more migration, more remittances” and the later an example of “more migration, fewer remittances”. In Section III we ask if the Turkish migratory pattern, and the fact that Turkish in Germany have evolved from remitters to savers, could be an effect that is starting to happen to Mexican migrants in the United States already. Finally Section IV explores some policy implications and concludes.</p><p>I - Why People Migrate and Remit?</p><p>Thousands of pages have been devoted to answer the very simple question: why do people migrate? There is no single satisfactory answer as it is evident to see that people migrate for many different reasons. In fact, the push and pull factors that motivate people to move from one place to another may vary by migratory system, depending on the circumstance people migrate for economic, political, and even environmental reasons. Push factors that prompt individuals to migrate include economic crisis, disparities in income and opportunities, political and religious persecution, natural disasters, and population pressures among others. Some of the factors that pull people out of their countries of origin may include higher wages, better job opportunities, religious and political liberties, better standard of living, etc.</p><p>In the literature we find a significant number of theories that study the migratory phenomenon from various perspectives such as neoclassical economics, segmented labor market theory, world systems, social capital, and cumulative causation (see Massey 1999 for a theoretical review). In this paper, however, we center our attention to the New Economics of Labor Migration (NELM) (Stark and Bloom 1985). This theory centers on the individual as unit of analysis. Here researchers are concerned with individual values and future expectations of migrants and potential migrants.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>The particular focus of this theory is on how the migration decision process is made</span>. According to NELM <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>migration decisions are not made</span></span><span class='card-underline'> in a vacuum </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>by isolated migrants, but</span></span><span class='card-underline'> are made </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>within families</span></span><span class='card-underline'> or even communities in order </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>to maximize their future income</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and to minimize their financial risks</span> (Stark and Bloom 1985). The question that arises now is, how does NELM help us understand immigrant remitting behavior? Several studies have concentrated on the remitting behavior of the migrants who send money home (Banerjee 1984, Cortina and de la Garza 2004, Durand et al., 1996, Lucas and Stark 1985, Osaki 2003, Stark and Lucas 1988). <span class='card-underline'>Immigrants remit for a wide number of reasons that can be encompassed into at least two conceptual perspectives. The first deals with remittances as inter-familial transfers for family maintenance and insurance</span> (Amuedo-Dorantes and Pozo 2002, Durand 1996, Massey 1999, Lucas and Stark 1985). <span class='card-underline'>These include transfers for basic consumption and asset accumulation. The second considers remittances as particular and/or community-oriented investment in the home country</span> (see Goldring 2004 for a comprehensive discussion).</p><p>In this paper we concentrate on the first conceptual category, that is, inter-familial transfers. In light of NELM migration theory, a common denominator that helps explain why immigrants send money home seems to be given by altruistic and non-altruistic reasons, which are sustained by an explicit or implicit contractual agreement between the migrant those family members left behind and sometimes between the migrant and her/his community of origin (Cortina and de la Garza 2004, Dustmann and Mestres 2007, Lucas and Stark 1985, Stark and Lucas 1988). Nonetheless, others have demonstrated that immigrants may also remit for “selfish”</p><p>In particular, some studies have argued that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the most significant predictors that explain why immigrants remit</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> are</span></span><span class='card-underline'> two: 1) </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>having direct family members</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and/or children </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>living in the home country; and</span></span>, 2) <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>having the expectation to </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>return to the home country</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> someday</span></span> (Cortina, de la Garza and Ochoa-Reza 2005, Sana and Massey 2005). Somehow following this literature, others argue that altruism is going to be strongest in cohesive traditional families and weaker in nontraditional families with unstable bonds (Sana and Massey 2005).</p><p>In this section we have briefly discussed recent literature that attempts to describe the relationship between migration and remittances. We have argued that once an individual has migrated, he or she has an implicit or explicit contract to send money home to those family members left behind. Within this framework, we would expect that an increase in the number of migrants in period 1 would increase the amount remitted in period 2. This relationship would be reinforced by the number of children and direct family members left behind. In other words, <span class='card-underline'>as long as new migrants have direct family members and/or children left behind, the overall number of immigrants that will be sending money home will continue to increase.</span> In short: more migration, more remittances.</p><p>The question that begs to be answered then is – <span class='card-underline'>what happens once migrants’ family members are reunited with her/him in the host country?</span> Do immigrants continue to remit? If so, do they remit at the same rate? Some argue that given immigrant’s transnational behavior they will continue to send money back home even if they have settled (Gilick Schiller 1999, Guarnizo 2003). We will argue that the opposite is true. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Once family members</span></span><span class='card-underline'> that had been left behind </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>are reunited in the host country, the contract by which migrants and family members</span></span><span class='card-underline'> left behind </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>were obliged becomes obsolete</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>(Sana and Massey 2005). <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Migrants then will stop remitting to the home country or</span></span><span class='card-underline'> at least will </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>substantially decrease the frequency and amount</span></span><span class='card-underline'> sent home</span> (Sana 2003 for the Mexican case). This of course does not mean that migrants have reduced its level of income. This means that instead of remitting, immigrants will now increase the level of savings they hold in their host country. They have transformed, indeed, from remitters to savers.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>The scenario is <span class='card-underline'>Latin American Governance</span>.

We take their model up to derive and show that such diversion of resources is positively associated with the ratio of household consumption expenditure to government consumption expenditure (we label this as “consumption expenditures ratio”), which in turn is increasing in the level of remittances relative to the GDP.

Barry et al. (2014) also posit –but do not test– that remittances mitigate protest by increasing the opportunity cost of challenging the regime. Indeed, existing evidence indicates that migrant remittances are an important source of income for households in many developing countries, resulting in less poverty (Adams and Page, 2005; World Bank, 2006a; Gupta, Pattillo and Wagh, 2009) and more consumption and investment, including local public goods (World Bank, 2006a,b; Fajnzylber and L´opez, 2007; Chami et al., 2008; Adida and Girod, 2011).

Talani (2014) makes a similar point about vicious circles in North Africa, where outmigration of the most able who cannot get ahead at home allows corrupt elites to remain in power and block the fundamental reforms necessary for sustainable growth.</p><p>Remittances can also be a two-edged sword in narrower economic terms. Countries such as Moldova that send workers abroad need to develop other export industries to keep workers at home in the future. However, <span class='card-underline'>if </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>remittances raise the value of the currencies of</span></span><span class='card-underline'> migrant-</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>sending countries, exports</span></span><span class='card-underline'> can </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>fall, displacing workers in export</span></span><span class='card-underline'>-oriented </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>sectors and choking</span></span><span class='card-underline'> off their </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>growth. This is an example of Dutch disease</span></span>: the rising value of the Dutch guilder after natural gas was discovered in the North Sea in the 1950s shrank the manufacturing sector and eliminated factory jobs. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Many migrants are from countries with small export sectors, and the remittances that benefit migrant families may</span></span><span class='card-underline'> simultaneously </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>hurt other families whose jobs depend on exporting</span></span><span class='card-underline'> manufacturing and agricultural goods that become more expensive as remittances drive up the value of the local currency</span> (Acosta et al., 2009; Atoyan etal., 2016: 21).</p><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>A shrinking export sector</span></span> and a higher share of the young and elderly among residents who depend on government programs <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>can mean less tax revenue and more demand for government services</span></span>. Governments must finance services for the elderly and children, and if they do so by raising taxes on ever fewer workers and their employers because many prime-aged workers are abroad, the economy's ability to produce goods and services competitively is reduced.</p><p>When a developing country produces workers for richer countries, the result can be a virtuous circle in which sending workers abroad in one period leads to stay-at-home development later, or a vicious circle in which villages turn into nurseries for children and nursing homes for the elderly that depend on external lifelines. There are examples of both virtuous and vicious circles between migration and development, suggesting skepticism when confronting assertions that migration speeds or slows development.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Latin America is backsliding into authoritarianism and dictatorships now – Maduro’s election signals a dramatic shift in regional politics </div><div class='cite'>Albertus 2018 (Michael Albertus, assistant professor of politics science at the University of Chicago.

From 2000–10, some 49 million people climbed out of poverty into the middle class in Latin America. Incomes rose dramatically, even as inequality in many countries remained stubbornly high. Leftist leaders rode the commodity boom in what became known as the “pink tide”, spending freely on social programs and infrastructure projects to voters’ delight.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>But the party ended with the commodity bust in 2015 through 2016</span>.

On top of that, <span class='card-underline'>governments overspent and engaged in all sorts of corrupt deal-making.</span></p><p><span class='card-underline'>Many middle-class citizens in the region began to sink back into poverty.

From 1999 through 2013, former president Hugo Chávez exploited popular disgust at unresponsive and elite-driven politics to revamp Venezuela’s political institutions in his favor, pack the courts, and leverage state resources to dominate his opposition for almost a decade.

It's impossible to predict exactly when events, or even specifically which events, could destabilize those countries, but it's clear that the governments of all three will face increasing challenges to their rule. In Bolivia, the leftist government of President Evo Morales is losing ground among voters hungry for political change — yet Morales has resisted the growing wave of political opposition. In Honduras, a populist political coalition threatens to unseat the ruling rightist coalition, which is striving to remain in power as long as possible despite the threat of violent unrest. In Cuba, a shift away from President Raul Castro's rule and an eventual lifting of the U.S. trade embargo will bring with it more competition for political power and financial benefits, which will erode the stable political order created over several decades by the Communist Party.</p><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Bolivia</span></span>: The Government's Political Pull Erodes</p><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>As Morales</span></span>, president since 2006, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>loses his grip</span></span><span class='card-underline'> on Bolivia's political system, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>instability </span></span><span class='card-underline'>there </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>will grow</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>.</span> The president, who won re-election in 2014 with 61 percent of the vote, still enjoys some popularity (around half of Bolivian voters still approve of his rule), but support for him and the ruling Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party has shown signs of slipping. In 2016, voters narrowly rejected a referendum that would have allowed Morales to run for re-election in 2019 despite reaching the limit on terms mandated by the Bolivian Constitution. <span class='card-underline'>Despite his defeat at the ballot box, a subsequent Constitutional Court ruling paved the way for Morales' re-election bid by removing the term limit provision</span>.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Even so, a growing number of voters are shifting away from Morales,</span> despite the country's strong economic growth in recent years. Although unemployment has shrunk and Bolivia's economy has grown by around 30 percent since Morales took office (largely due to increasing natural gas exports to Brazil and Argentina), many of the jobs created pay poorly. <span class='card-underline'>Morales' waning popularity</span><span class='card-underline'> among the electorate </span><span class='card-underline'>doesn't bode well</span><span class='card-underline'> for MAS, which is closely identified with the president and can feature no other political figure to match Morales</span>. The president's administration has already demonstrated its willingness to keep Morales afloat politically — <span class='card-underline'>resorting to the judicial decision on term limits when popular support proved lacking. Without him on the ballot, MAS runs the risk of a greater political defeat in 2019</span>.</p><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The 2019 election </span></span><span class='card-underline'>will be the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>clearest potential flashpoint</span></span><span class='card-underline'> for political instability in Bolivia</span>. There will be little the government can do to remain in power if it suffers a decisive loss. But <span class='card-underline'>if Morales' popularity continues to hover around 50 percent, a close electoral race could result. A hotly contested election</span>, particularly one in which accusations of voter fraud fly, <span class='card-underline'>runs the risk of inflaming an already tense domestic political scene. Demo</span><span class='card-underline'>nstrations would spread</span>, particularly in eastern provinces such as Santa Cruz, a hub of the Bolivian political opposition's strength. <span class='card-underline'>To defend its legitimacy in case of a close vote, </span><span class='card-underline'>the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>government would mobilize its own voters</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, raising the possibility of widespread transport disruptions and violent confrontations between groups of political opponents</span>. Such confrontations run the risk of spiraling into a wave of protests and counterprotests, since a close election could give the Bolivian opposition grounds to claim it's the legitimate heir to power. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>That</span></span><span class='card-underline'> situation </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>could bring about the risk of</span></span><span class='card-underline'> a brief period of </span><span class='card-underline'>possibly</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> violent political confrontation </span></span><span class='card-underline'>across the country.</span></p><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Cuba</span></span>: The Communist Party's Internal Challenges</p><p>To most observers, Cuba may appear to be an unlikely candidate for political instability. After all, it has a robust internal security apparatus and there are no meaningful domestic political challengers to the Communist Party. But that state of affairs will likely change once the U.S. trade embargo on the island nation is lifted. <span class='card-underline'>Despite deteriorating political ties between Havana and Washington, Cuba will continue to press to have the embargo lifted</span> — and despite the prevailing sentiment in the White House, a thawing of relations is likely, at least eventually. <span class='card-underline'>While Cuba's sitting government is ideologically hostile to Washington, its state-run economic model is unsustainable without assistance from abroad</span>. To forestall heavier austerity measures, <span class='card-underline'>the Cuban administration will attempt a slow economic opening to the outside world. As part of that effort, it will negotiate a lifting of the embargo imposed by its neighbor after the Cuban revolution</span>. Among most U.S. politicians and companies, lifting the embargo is a relatively popular proposal, although the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump reinstated stricter limits on the relationship between the countries after a brief thaw under his predecessor.</p><p>If it eventually happens, lifting the embargo would provide an economic windfall for Cuba, mainly in the form of greater tourism revenue and related economic growth. <span class='card-underline'>But a </span><span class='card-underline'>greater inflow of dollars</span><span class='card-underline'> into a post-Castro Cuba </span><span class='card-underline'>is a recipe for greater</span><span class='card-underline'> political </span><span class='card-underline'>instability in the long run</span>. <span class='card-underline'>The U.S. private sector would likely see lifting the embargo as a long-term benefit, albeit accompanied by a greater risk of upending the traditional, Communist-enforced political balance</span>. While Raul Castro, now 86, would likely have died by the time the embargo is fully lifted, power will rest with a new civilian president whose authority will rest on the approval of the armed forces. <span class='card-underline'>The system the Castro brothers established over several decades prioritized political stability by giving direct relatives and associates of the president</span>, such as Raul Castro's son-in-law, Gen. Luis Alberto Rodriguez Lopez, <span class='card-underline'>control of key government institutions</span>. These include Rodriguez Lopez's control of a tourism conglomerate that administers much of the island's dollar revenue. <span class='card-underline'>Greater </span><span class='card-underline'>tourism revenue would create more opportunities for economic growth, which in Cuba's state-run economy would translate into more money and political power for prominent members of the armed forces</span>. A lucrative, state-run tourism sector in the hands of few military leaders may turn into a tempting target for other members of the military who feel they are being left out.</p><p>Such instability would take years to materialize, however. Raul Castro has likely carefully orchestrated his transition of power — planned for this year — to civilian leader Miguel Diaz Canel. The Castro-era stability will likely persist for years after that power transition. As part of any deal to lift the U.S. embargo, Cuba's government would have to make democratic reforms — strengthening the influence of opposition parties in power. <span class='card-underline'>Cuba has no sustained history of peaceful political transitions, and so ultimate power rests with whoever can command the most security units.</span> <span class='card-underline'>Currently, that</span><span class='card-underline'> command rests firmly with the presidential administration</span>, but as economic opportunities spread out, competing poles of power could arise in the Cuban government. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>With stronger opposition parties and</span></span><span class='card-underline'> the potential for </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>factionalization</span></span><span class='card-underline'> in the post-Castro government, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Cuba</span></span><span class='card-underline'> appears </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>set to become more </span></span><span class='card-underline'>politically </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>unstable</span></span><span class='card-underline'> even as more U.S. tourists visit and U.S. companies come to see it as an easier place in which to do business</span>.</p><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Honduras</span></span>: The Left and Right Struggle for Control</p><p>In Honduras, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>political instability is </span></span><span class='card-underline'>already</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> present,</span></span><span class='card-underline'> but </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>future election</span></span><span class='card-underline'> cycles </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>will only aggravate it</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>.</span> <span class='card-underline'>Honduran politics</span>, long the bastion of the rightist National Party and the more centrist Liberal Party, <span class='card-underline'>are now sharply split between the ruling National Party and the more leftist opposition alliance</span> spearheaded by former president Manuel Zelaya's Liberty and Refoundation Party. <span class='card-underline'>Zelaya's party split from the Liberal Party after he was overthrown in a 2009 military coup</span>. In recent years, high-profile incidents of corruption by the National Party have reduced its support among voters. For the Nov. 25 presidential election, the opposition's addition of popular sportscaster Salvador Nasralla to the ballot helped it closely compete with the National Party — the final margin was less than a percentage point.

To determine the number of family-preference visas issued each year, the number of visas issued to immediate relatives is subtracted from the 480,000. For example, in fiscal year 2015, about 69 percent of family-based admissions went to US citizens’ spouses and children.

This category is called “immediate relatives of U.S. citizens.” For all other relations, however, there are strict limits on the total number in each category. All “immediate relatives” plus all of the family preference categories must fit within an overall ceiling for family-based immigration of 480,000, but this ceiling can be exceeded due to the fact that there is a “floor” of 226,000 for the family preference categories (non-immediate relatives) coupled with the fact that immediate relatives are not capped. (So, when immediate relative immigration is more than 254,000 (480,000 – 226,000), the overall ceiling is “pierced.”) For many years now, there have been no more than 226,000 visas allocated to the family preference categories because immediate relative immigration has been more than 254,000 per year. This is the heart of the backlog problem with family preference immigration.</p><p>In addition to these category limits, <span class='card-underline'>the ceiling on the number of people we allow in from any one country is approximately 25,600</span>. This ceiling includes immigrants in the family-preference categories and immigrants who are coming here through the sponsorship of an employer.

At the end of the immigration process, when an immigrant visa is available to the immigrant, there may be an administrative backlog due to the fact that the immigration service may not have sufficient resources to handle its workload.

The filing of that petition establishes a priority date, holding the immigrant’s place in line. The State Department keeps tabs on whether or not there are visas available within the category and per-country limits. If there is no backlog, an immigrant visa (or “green card”) is immediately available to the immigrant, and the immigrant will receive one as soon as the government processes the application. In the application process, checks are performed to make sure the individual has no criminal history, is not a security threat, and is otherwise not inadmissible as an immigrant to the U.S.</p><p>In recent years, however, <span class='card-underline'>the number of visas available in our family immigration system has not met the demand. Except for the spouses, children, and parents of U.S. citizens, for which there are no per-country or category ceilings, there are backlogs in all categories of family-based immigration</span>[2]. Each month, the State Department publishes a table showing the availability of immigrant visas relative to their priority dates. The “Visa Bulletin,” in which this table is published, can be found on the Web site of the State Department at:</p><p>http://www.travel.state.gov/visa/bulletin/bulletin_1360.html.</p><p>As of November 2011 (according to the most recent State Department report on the number of persons waiting for an immigrant visa), there were more than 300,000 wives, husbands and children of legal permanent residents waiting for immigrant visas[3]. By August 2012, these immigrants were only now receiving a visa if their priority date was earlier than March 15, 2010—that is, after a wait of almost two and a half years. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>A</span></span><span class='card-underline'> U.S. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>citizen who petitioned for a sibling is</span></span><span class='card-underline'> only now </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>being rejoined</span></span> with that sister or brother <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>after a wait of 11 years</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and six months.</span> Compared to the number of visas available each year, the category of siblings of U.S. citizens has the largest backlog. <span class='card-underline'>As of November 2011, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>there were more than 2.5 million siblings waiting for the 65,000 visas</span></span><span class='card-underline'> available each year</span>.[4]</p><p>The current projections of the backlogs that appear in the Visa Bulletin may actually understate the wait an immigrant will eventually have. For reasons having to do with the ability of the government to keep up with the demand for “adjustment of status” cases, the “current” priority date may actually go backwards from one month to the next. For example, in January 2011 the priority date for which visas were being allocated for the category of siblings of U.S. citizens was January 1, 2002. By February 2011, the priority date had actually receded to January 1, 2000.</p><p>Given that we have already decided, in the structure of our immigration law, to make family unity a priority, <span class='card-underline'>it does not make sense to have an outdated quota system that keeps families separated for many years.</span> If we as a nation continue to believe that it is important to keep families together, then <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>we must reform our immigration system so that the category and per-country limits</span></span><span class='card-underline'> that we now have on family-based immigration </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>meet our needs</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span></p><p>Current law regarding family unification should be updated</p><p>The emphasis we place in our immigration law on the reunification of families makes sense in terms of helping our newcomers adapt to their new home. Family members help each other adjust to their new surroundings by pooling resources and sharing responsibilities (for example, for the care of children or elderly parents).</p><p>The inability to bring family members makes it harder for U.S. companies to attract the workers they need. Workers who do come may be less productive if forced to endure a long separation from their families. Additionally, immigrants coming to the U.S. as a result of family ties also get jobs and become valuable contributors to our economy. Finally, strong families help stabilize communities.</p><p>As the backlogs grow, more families are facing the choice of remaining separated for several years or keeping the family intact by having some members enter illegally. The backlogs are also yielding consequences contrary to some of our other policy goals. For Filipinos, for example, becoming a U.S. citizen may mean a longer separation from adult children. The backlog for the adult children of Filipinos who become citizens is longer than the wait to bring in adult unmarried children of permanent residents. As a practical matter, reuniting with family in this case may mean postponing citizenship.</p><p>Immigration reform is needed to speed the reunification of families</p><p>Changes to the family preference system are needed so that families might be re-united in a timelier manner. Updating our family immigration laws will reduce the pressure for family members to migrate outside of legal channels. By creating wider legal channels for immigrants to come here, the number of people who come illegally will be reduced or eliminated.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>There are a number of things Congress could do to alleviate the backlogs</span> and their consequences.</p><p>Update the immigrant quota system: Our immigrant quota system has not been updated in more than two decades, despite increased demand. There are several ways that Congress could reform the system. <span class='card-underline'>“</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Immediate relatives” could be exempted</span></span><span class='card-underline'> from the</span><span class='card-underline'> family-sponsored immigrant </span><span class='card-underline'>cap</span><span class='card-underline'> 480,000, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>so that the cap would apply only to preference immigrants</span></span>. The definition of immediate relative might be expanded to include the spouses and minor children of legal permanent residents. This would free up visas in the limited family preference system so they could be re-allocated to the remaining categories of family-sponsored immigrants. With these extra visas, there would be much progress in reducing the long backlog now experienced by these categories of immigrants.</p><p>Place a cap on the backlog: Congress could provide for waivers to the per-country and world-wide numerical limits to family reunification that would be triggered when an immigrant’s wait exceeded a period of time—five years, for example. Any eligible family-sponsored immigrant who had waited five years or more would be given a visa whether or not that year’s quotas had been reached.</p><p>Re-allocate unused visas from the prior year: Even though there is more demand for visas than there are available visas, it sometimes happens (usually, because of processing delays or security screening) that some of the visas that should be allocated in a given year are not allocated. If not allocated, the visas are not used. <span class='card-underline'>Congress could change the law so that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>when processing delays result in unused visas, those unused visas are made available the following year,</span></span><span class='card-underline'> outside of the current year’s per country or quota limits. Going back and </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>re-capturing unused visas would have a significant impact on backlogs</span></span>. According to the USCIS Ombudsman, between 1992 and 2009, there were nearly 242,000 visas in the family preference system that went unused.[5].</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Plan broadens the definition of family to include any kinship network</div><div class='cite'>Hawthorne, 07 – Pro Tem Instructor at the University of Oregon School of Law (Monique, “FAMILY UNITY IN IMMIGRATION LAW: BROADENING THE SCOPE OF “FAMILY”,” Lewis and Clark Law Review, Vol. 11:3, 9/15/07)//RCUSNAF = Standard North American Family</div><div class='card-body'><p>C.

The North American Family Model Versus Other Cultural Family Models </p><p>The SNAF image may be more prevalent in movies, television shows, magazines, and books, but this does not make it the only family model in the U.S. Many movies and television shows depict fathers who work, mothers who cook and clean (she may have a job, but her dominant role is caretaker), and children who are all in school.103 “Scholars concerned about the impact of such images point to those who blame family structures that deviate from th[e] norm for many of society’s problems and who suggest policies that ignore or punish families that don’t fit the construct.”104 <span class='card-underline'>The cultural values of these “deviant” types of families are considered abnormal to the SNAF. In reality though, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>other family models exist all over the world and throughout the United States</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span></p><p>Single person and two-person households have come to play an ever more important role, as have other models—grandparent-grandchild households, for example—in which others, relatives and non-relatives, live in the household, either in addition to or instead of the expected nuclear family members . . . . Despite its diminished reality, immigration law is based on the assumptions of the dominant model.105</p><p>The question remains, though, if family dynamics are changing in the United States, why do immigration laws continue to preference the SNAF model of family?</p><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>In most of the different ethnic groups immigrating</span></span><span class='card-underline'> to the United States, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>family structures are multigenerational</span></span>.106 Growing up in the Asian culture, I myself have experienced a multigenerational family with cousins and grandparents living under the same roof. For most of my life in the United States, my paternal grandfather was a primary caregiver.

If our own American society cannot reflect the ideals of our laws, how can we expect others to conform to our idealized standards? For example, the United States may deny admission to a foreign national with a criminal history.112 However, a United States citizen with a criminal history who goes on vacation will be admitted back to the United States.113 One possible explanation is the desire to limit admissions to people who we think will add to the quality of our society and to not admit those people who will add to or exacerbate our society’s problems. We, as members of our society, can decide who we want to include.114 While this idea may be applicable when immigration laws exclude criminals,115 prostitutes,116 and people with communicable diseases,117 it loses applicability when applied to family models. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The function of family is subjective and unique</span></span><span class='card-underline'> to each family unit. It is clear that “[t]he idea of what constitutes a family and its positive characteristics needs to be expanded.”</span>118 Although advocating that each family be allowed to define themselves for immigration purposes would be ideal, this solution would lead to an unworkable rule. Instead, the United States should broaden its family categories so that they are broader and more flexible, similar to Canada’s immigration laws.</p><p>2. A Broader Definition of “Family”: Canada’s Example</p><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The United States should adopt an immigration model that is similar to Canada’s</span></span><span class='card-underline'> model.</span> Like the United States, Canada has a policy for family reunification. However, unlike the U.S., Canada’s policy is more effectively carried out in its immigration statutes. Canada’s Immigration and Refugee Protection Act of 2001 119 expanded the definition of “family” to include family members that are not presently included under U.S. immigration law. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The first </span></span><span class='card-underline'>apparent</span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>difference is the inclusion of</span></span><span class='card-underline'> a “common-law partner or conjugal partner.”120 This allows </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>same-sex partners to enter</span></span><span class='card-underline'> Canada </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>as a member of the family</span></span>. Under the INA, the U.S. doesn’t acknowledge same-sex partners as “family,” even if the country of origin acknowledges the two as a married couple. In order to adopt a policy similar to Canada’s policy, the U.S. does not need to recognize the same-sex marriage, but merely that same-sex partners have family bonds that should be protected under United States’ immigration laws.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Canada also allows</span> “the mother or father of the sponsor’s mother or father” to enter as a member of the family.121 Therefore, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>a</span></span><span class='card-underline'> petitioning </span><span class='card-underline'>citizen</span><span class='card-underline'> or </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>legal permanent resident would be able to bring their grandparent</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>to Canada. The inability to bring in one’s grandparent to the United States under existing family preference categories, is a source of major frustration for many immigrants, especially if they come from a culture where families are multigenerational and grandparents are considered part of the “nuclear” family.122 If the U.S. is to effectuate its policy for family reunification, then Congress should amend the “immediate relative” category to include grandparents. Hence, when birthright U.S. citizens, naturalized citizens, or legal permanent residents reach the age of twenty-one123 they would be able to petition for the admission of their grandparents. This chance would solve some of the mixed-status family’s problems.124</p><p>For some U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>another source of frustration is not being able to sponsor relatives</span></span><span class='card-underline'> whom </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>they have raised as their own children, but</span></span><span class='card-underline'> that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>are not</span></span><span class='card-underline'> necessarily </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>their biological children</span></span>.125 However, <span class='card-underline'>Canada has recognized that these types of relationships must be included within the definition of “family,” and are necessary if family reunification is to be more than just an aspirational goal. </span>If an orphan is under the age of eighteen and is unmarried, Canada will allow him or her to enter as long as the child is “a child of the sponsor’s mother or father” (a brother or sister), “a child of a child of the sponsor’s mother or father” (a nephew or niece), or “a child of the sponsor’s child” (a grandchild).126 The United States should adopt these provisions.</p><p>Canada’s broadest expansion of “family” is the inclusion of any relative, regardless of age, as a member of the “family class.” If the petitioner does not have any family members that fall within the aforementioned family categories, the petitioner is allowed to bring in any relative.127 Canada recognizes that despite the fact that someone may have no blood relatives, he or she may still have family-like relations that are worthy of protection by the country’s immigration laws. This final category provides a necessary element of flexibility to encompass different notions of “family.”</p><p>3. Broadening the Scope of “Family” and its Effects on Mixed-Status Families</p><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The definition of “family” cannot remain static because the status quo has led to problems with</span></span><span class='card-underline'> family </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>reunification and</span></span><span class='card-underline'> created </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>mixed-status families</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> As discussed above, undocumented immigrants often desire to legitimize their presence, but because of the possibility of family separation, they tend to avoid drawing attention to themselves. Many of the problems facing mixed-status families would be solved if they could have entered legally in the first place. Assuming arguendo that a majority of people seeking entry have some familial contact to the United States, they would have more opportunities to seek sponsorship among those already in the United States. After receiving permission to enter, their families would then be derivative beneficiaries. The United States could even provide a threshold standard in order to take advantage of the family petitions. For example, Canada has considered a standard requiring the sponsored individual to be “known and emotionally important to” the sponsor.128 <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>If the “known and emotionally important” standard is adopted</span></span><span class='card-underline'> in the United States, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Congress could create factors</span></span><span class='card-underline'> for an immigration officer to use, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>such as actual familial kinship</span></span><span class='card-underline'> relationship, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>length of acquaintance</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>length of shared residence, geographical distance</span></span><span class='card-underline'> between residences, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>knowledge of</span></span><span class='card-underline'> each other’s </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>personal histories,</span></span><span class='card-underline'> number of </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>shared experiences, and strength of bond</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, which would aid in a flexible application of derivative beneficiary status.</span></p><p>Critics of expanding the scope of “family” may argue that the Department of Homeland Security—more specifically the INS—is already overwhelmed by the number of entrants, pointing to the log jam in the priority dates. They may claim that an expansion of those who may qualify as “family” will burden an already overburdened agency and that examining each applicant’s relationship would be too cumbersome and difficult. Consider, however, that the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) recently received a nearly 4.8% budget increase under President Bush’s Fiscal Year 2006 budget.129 This equals a $6.7 billion total budget. If people are given more legal avenues to enter the United States, fewer people will attempt crossing the borders illegally. The money saved could then be diverted to deal with a heavier volume of family applications. Not only are there enough resources to administer this broader definition of “family,”</p><p>[C]ountries find it to their advantage to admit close family members of migrants. Often they are able to facilitate the integration process and to enable the migrant to establish him- or herself more quickly . . . . The presence of family members also reduces remittance abroad—a useful benefit for the receiving countries since the immigrants will spend the money on consumption or investment in their new home country.130</p><p>When all factors are considered, a broader scope of “family” seems to be a win-win situation.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Strict definitions of family in immigration law undermine effective kinship networks</div><div class='cite'>Gubernskaya and Dreby, 17 – Gubernskaya is an Assistant Professor of Sociology at the University at Albany-SUNY; Dreby is an Assistant Professor of Sociology at the University at Albany-SUNY (Zoya and Joanna, 2017, "US Immigration Policy and the Case for Family Unity," Journal on Migration and Human Security, Volume 5, Number 2)//RCU</div><div class='card-body'><p>Although <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the current</span></span><span class='card-underline'> US immigration </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>policy</span></span> includes a relatively large list of relatives, it <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>emphasizes legal definitions of family and assumes that formal</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, close kinship </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>ties are the most instrumental</span></span>.

This was a term first used by Alvin Hansen in the 1930s to describe slow growth due in part to aging societies, among other issues. Some of Japan’s economic stagnation is thought to be related to its demographics since its population is the oldest and fastest-aging in the world.</p><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Economic growth occurs when workers and capital are added to the economy, along with technology</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, a well-known result from growth models first developed by the Nobel Prize-winning economist</span> Robert <span class='card-underline'>Solow</span>. <span class='card-underline'>But an aging population means fewer workers. Fewer workers require fewer office buildings and machinery, which depresses investment and therefore the economic outlook.</span> </p><p>Another wrinkle is that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the U.S. has been suffering from stagnant median wage growth for decades</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>.</span> <span class='card-underline'>Low pay means that some companies hire workers instead of installing more units of capital, which further depresses investment. That means that two factors that drive growth are subdued.</span></p><p><span class='card-underline'>That point of where demographics hits growth seems to be approaching: </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>U.</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>S. labor-force growth has slowed to just 0.2% a year, down from 2.1% from the 1960s to 1980s</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>.</span></span> A slower growth rate is associated with lower interest rates, and this is seen in the yields of Treasury bonds along the yield curve. In other words, the expectation in bond markets is that the new neutral interest rate, or where the current rate rises will end up, will be lower than the previous average rate of 5%.</p><p>The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the think tank for rich countries, has looked at this issue and finds that weak output growth is a drag on productivity. That brings us full circle in that output per worker or machine can’t increase strongly if overall economic growth remains subdued.</p><p>So how much is invested, including in raising the skills of existing workers, matters a great deal to boost growth. It also means that <span class='card-underline'>the new path of </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>economic growth</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, whether it is fast or slow, is </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>within the control of the government</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and firms as well as workers who can invest in their own human capital to be better equipped to use technology. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>It is not just the inevitable outcome of an aging society.</span></span></p><p>But one challenge is that <span class='card-underline'>recent technological improvements, centered on information and communication technologies and the internet, do not seem to have raised productivity across the economy as expected. Solow’s 1987 observation that “you can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics” is known as the Solow paradox.</span> He revisited this question decades later, but concluded that we still do not know whether computers have boosted productivity as the role of computing is still evolving.</p><p>Where there have been periods of faster productivity growth, such as in the late 1990s, it seemed to be due to technology being better embedded into business practices. Embedded technology improves the productivity of workers, which increases capital accumulation by slowing down the diminishing returns to capital. Diminishing returns happen when a worker is given more than, say, one computer; that worker won’t produce as much with the second computer as compared with the first one unless he has the programming skills to run an algorithm that allows computing to be done without the worker using it all the time. </p><p>If the digital age is to increase productivity and lead to a stronger phase of economic growth, it will require investment in not just R&D, but also peoples’ skills and firms’ practices to embed those technologies into how businesses operate. An example is law firms that are starting to use AI to conduct some aspects of due diligence, which frees up the time of junior associates to undertake other legal work.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Although the Solow paradox is still with us, there are signs that technology is becoming better embedded, such as artificial intelligence that </span><span class='card-underline'>can do</span><span class='card-underline'> computing without a constant human presence.</span> But to ensure that happens requires investment in more nuanced ways — notably in how to embed tech into the workplace. This will vary from firm to firm, but investing in this area, as well as in the well-understood areas of R&D/innovation, will likely generate returns.</p><p>It could even lead to a virtuous circle of growth. Seeing higher output per worker could induce more investment by firms as the returns to capital are higher. And more investment in turn raises economic growth rates, and that could help us avoid a slow growth future.</p><p>So, reassuringly, <span class='card-underline'>demography is not destiny. It is within our control to invest in ways that better embed technologies, which in turn would help us to avoid a slow growth future. </span></p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'><span class='card-highlight'>Expanding high-skilled </span><span class='card-highlight'>immigration boosts </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>total factor productivity</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> --- allowing the U.S. to maintain </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>3 percent growth</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> despite the aging population crisis</span></div><div class='cite'><span class='card-highlight'>Griswold</span>, <span class='card-highlight'>17</span> --- senior research fellow and co-director of the Program on the American Economy and Globalization at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University (October, Daniel, “Reforming the US Immigration System to Promote Growth,” https://www.mercatus.org/system/files/griswold-immigration-reform-mercatus-research-v1.pdf, accessed on 5/9/18, JMP)</div><div class='card-body'><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>AMERICA NEEDS IMMIGRANTS TO GROW AND PROSPER</span></span></p><p>Central to its economic agenda, the Trump administration seeks to boost the annual growth rate of real US gross domestic product from 2.1 percent (the average rate since 2010) to 3.0 percent or more.

If immigration were cut off immediately, the ratio would reach 55.9 by 2065.9 </p><p>The smaller the future Old Age Dependency Ratio, the less strain there will be on federal retirement programs. <span class='card-underline'>A steady or increased inflow of immi</span><span class='card-underline'>grant workers helps to spread the cost of funding old-age pension payments across a larger pool of workers, reducing the need to raise payroll taxes, cut benefits, or both.</span> </p><p>More Immigrants, More Output, More Jobs </p><p>Immigration reform would allow the US economy to grow faster by increasing the number of workers in the labor force and the total number of hours worked per year. <span class='card-underline'>Because immigrants are more likely to be of working age than native-born Americans and are more likely to seek work, immigration can help to slow or even reverse the recent trend of declining labor force participation.</span> </p><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>An increase in the workforce driven by immigration does not lead to a gen</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>eral displacement of existing native-born workers</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> <span class='card-underline'>Although the US labor force has more than doubled in the past 50 years, there has been no upward trend in the unemployment rate because the economic activity enabled by the growth in workers has also stimulated demand for workers.</span>10 <span class='card-underline'>As the workforce grows, so too does demand for all the goods and services that American households pur</span><span class='card-underline'>chase, from groceries and cars to education and housing. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>This increased demand in turn stimulates more production, leading to more employment </span></span><span class='card-underline'>and the main</span><span class='card-underline'>tenance of full employment</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>.</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span></p><p><span class='card-underline'>A growing workforce also stimulates investment by increasing the returns on capital. While immigration can put downward pressure on wages in certain indus</span><span class='card-underline'>tries in the short run, the availability of more workers at competitive wages creates incentives for greater investment. And </span><span class='card-underline'>rising investment stimulates more demand for labor, increases productivity, and creates upward pressure on wages</span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> <span class='card-underline'>The increased investment spurred by immigration means that</span>, over time<span class='card-underline'>, the capital-to-labor ratio grows the same amount even if the number of immigrants increases.</span>11</p><p>Immigrants Complement US Workers, Increasing Gains from Specialization </p><p>Immigrants do more than increase the size of the labor force. Because <span class='card-underline'>immi</span><span class='card-underline'>grants tend to have different skills than the typical native, they boost the growth of the US economy by filling niches in the labor market. Immigrants tend to be overrepresented at the higher and lower ends of the skill spectrum, while native-born Americans tend to be clustered in the middle skill levels. Immigrants make up 17 percent of the US workforce, but they account for more than one-third of workers in the United States with a PhD in</span> the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math (<span class='card-underline'>STEM</span>). On the other end of the skills spectrum, immigrants represent 40 percent of those in the workforce without a high school diploma.12 </p><p><span class='card-underline'>The complementary nature of immigration means that immigrants do not compete directly with </span><span class='card-underline'>the vast majority of</span><span class='card-underline'> Americans for employment.</span> In fact, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>by providing skills that are in relatively short supply, immigrants enable US workers to be more productive</span></span>. <span class='card-underline'>In the technology area, immigrants make up a disproportionate share of scientists, college professors, and technical work</span><span class='card-underline'>ers. Native-born Americans are not earning qualifying degrees in numbers suf</span><span class='card-underline'>ficient to fill the available positions in US industry.</span> By filling those positions, high-skilled immigrants add to the “agglomeration effect” by creating a critical mass of workers in a particular region and industry where ideas can be shared more easily.13 Silicon Valley is the most notable example. </p><p><span class='card-underline'>Because of differences in English proficiency, immigrants tend to concen</span><span class='card-underline'>trate in more technical occupations such as the job of computer specialist. This creates more opportunities for native-born workers, who are more concentrated among managers, sales personnel, and other occupations requiring more interac</span><span class='card-underline'>tion with customers and subordinates.</span>14 </p><p>On the lower rungs of the skills ladder, immigrants fill jobs that fewer and fewer Americans are interested in, and they fill those positions at wage rates that allow their industries to remain competitive in the US market. Such jobs require only short-term, on-the-job training and include health service workers, personal service workers, farm laborers, cleaning service and food service workers, construction workers, textile machine operators, carpenters, and nonfarm laborers.15 Low-skilled immigrants also fill positions in the growing health and home care service sectors, such as home health aides, nursing aides, orderlies, attendants, personal and home care aides, medical assistants, and maids and housekeepers.16 </p><p>Such jobs were filled in decades past by adult Americans without a high school diploma, but the number of native-born Americans in that category has been steadily shrinking. From 2000 to 2016, the number of native-born Americans 25 and older who had not completed high school fell by almost 7 million, from 20.5 million to 13.5 million. As a share of the adult native-born population, the share of high school dropouts has declined in that same period from 13.4 percent to 7.6 percent, and the share continues to decline.17 </p><p>Contrary to popular belief, a large majority of native-born workers do not compete for jobs with low-skilled immigrants. Studies show that immigration may have a modest negative effect on wages earned by the small and shrinking pool of adult Americans without a high school diploma,18 but the impact on the wages of the other 92 percent of native-born Americans in the labor force is neutral to positive. <span class='card-underline'>On the high-skilled end of the spectrum, the impact of immi</span><span class='card-underline'>gration on the wages of the native born is muted by the complementary nature of the immigrants’ skills.</span> Matthew J. <span class='card-underline'>Slaughter, a former member of the president’s Council of Economic Advisers, noted</span> in a survey of immigration and productivity growth, <span class='card-underline'>“</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Skilled immigrants tend to complement, not substitute for, native</span></span><span class='card-underline'>-born </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>workers in US companies</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. Companies that hire more skilled immigrants tend to hire more native-born workers as well.”</span>19 </p><p><span class='card-underline'>A rising share of immigrants in the labor market also encourages Ameri</span><span class='card-underline'>cans to upgrade their skills with more education and to shift into areas of employment where language skills are more important and tend to be rewarded. As immigrants enter the workforce, Americans tend to stay in school longer to upgrade their skills and their potential earning power.</span> A 2012 study found that an increase in the presence of immigrants in the workforce increased the probability that native-born Americans will stay in school and complete their high school education.20 Other research suggests that in states with a heavier concentration of less educated immigrants, native-born workers are more likely to shift to more communication-intensive occupations, where their language skills give them an advantage and where wages are typically higher than in manual jobs. This has the collective effect of raising the productivity of Americans in the workforce.21</p><p>Lower-skilled immigrants also boost productivity and output by supplying services that allow higher-skilled Americans to raise their productivity. The 2016 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) noted that low-skilled immigrants reduce the price US households pay for immigrant-intensive services such as childcare, eating out, house cleaning and repair, landscaping and gardening, taxi rides, and construction. The affordability of such services allows native-born workers in higher-salaried jobs, especially women, to increase their paid work hours.22</p><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Immigrants promote faster US economic growth because they are generally more flexible about when and where they will work.</span></span> Immigrants have proven to be more geographically mobile. They are less likely to be rooted in one geographic location and are therefore more willing than natives to move to places where demand for their labor is higher than the supply.23 That can mean moving to urban centers of high-tech activity or to rural areas in need of specific kinds of labor, from agriculture to healthcare. They are also more willing to work unusual hours, at nights and on weekends, which provides more labor for the economy in a way that is less likely to compete directly with US-born workers.24 <span class='card-underline'>Greater mobility serves the overall economy by reducing regional differences in employment and by allowing work to be spread out across time and space.</span></p><p>In summary, immigrants do not ordinarily compete with Americans for a limited number of jobs; instead, they work with and for native-born workers in a cooperative way that lifts the general productivity and prosperity of the United States.</p><p>Immigrants Spur Innovation, Patents, and Startups</p><p>Immigrants create wealth in America by spurring innovation and founding new companies. <span class='card-underline'>Highly skilled immigrants are more likely to file patent applications than their native-born counterparts and are more likely to start new businesses, fueling entrepreneurial activity, providing new products and services, and creating employment opportunities for native-born workers, while raising overall productivity.</span> <span class='card-underline'>The patenting and innovation spurred by immigrants allow the</span> <span class='card-underline'>U</span>nited <span class='card-underline'>S</span>tates <span class='card-underline'>to shift beyond its production possibility frontier, which raises the speed limit for the economy’s long-run growth potential.</span></p><p>The 2016 NASEM report found that “immigrants are more innovative than natives; more specifically, <span class='card-underline'>high-skilled immigrants raise patenting per capita, which is likely to boost productivity and per capita economic growth.”</span> While immigrants account for 13 percent of the US population, they are responsible for one-third of all patent filings in the United States.25</p><p>The United States has been the world’s greatest beneficiary so far from the international mobility of skilled labor. The United States has attracted the largest net inflow of global inventors who have filed international patents. Based on data from the World Intellectual Property Organization from 2001 to 2010, a recent study determined that “the United States has received an enormous net surplus of inventors from abroad, while China and India have been major source countries.”26 Again, the prime example is Silicon Valley in California. The same study found that “more than half of the high-skilled technology workers and entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley are foreign-born.”27</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Immigrants are also more likely to found new enterprises, from ethnic restaurants to billion-dollar technology companies.</span>28 Some of the most famous and successful US companies today were founded or cofounded by first- or second- generation immigrants. <span class='card-underline'>According to a June 2017 report from the Massachusetts Technology Leadership Council, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>40 percent of America’s Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or the children of immigrants</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. A 2016 study by the National Foundation for American Policy found that more than half of the startup companies in the</span> <span class='card-underline'>U</span>nited <span class='card-underline'>S</span>tates <span class='card-underline'>today that are valued at more than $1 billion, so-called “unicorns,” were started by immigrants.</span> The 44 unicorn companies founded by immigrants each employed an average of 760 workers.29</p><p>As one study of global talent flows concluded, “The weight of the evidence points to high-skilled immigrants boosting innovation and productivity—mainly through increased quantity of skilled individuals pursuing innovative work.”30</p><p>“Immigration Surplus” Raises Income of Americans</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Immigrants fuel economic growth, wealth creation, and higher average incomes in the countries where they settle.</span> The primary beneficiaries are the immigrants themselves, but native-born individuals are also net beneficiaries. <span class='card-underline'>The economies of scale of a larger domestic economy, the economic diversity and complementarities, and the ideas, innovation, and entrepreneurship that immigrants bring create a net gain in wealth for their native counterparts.</span></p><p><span class='card-underline'>Economists call this the “immigration surplus.” It is the net gain available to natives when the economic costs from immigration are subtracted from the benefits.</span> The number is typically small compared to America’s huge economy, but while estimates vary, they are invariably positive. Under conventional assumptions, the annual immigration surplus from the current stock of US immigrants is estimated to be in the range of 0.1 to 0.4 percent of US gross domestic product.31 That translates into $19 billion to $74 billion in today’s economy in the total net benefits accrued to native-born Americans from current levels of immigration.</p><p>In a comprehensive 2016 study of the economic impact of immigration on the economies of wealthier nations such as the United States, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded, “Immigration significantly increases GDP per capita in advanced economies.” Specifically, <span class='card-underline'>the IMF study estimated that a one-percentage- point increase in the share of migrants in the adult population can </span><span class='card-underline'>raise GDP per capita by up to 2 percent</span><span class='card-underline'> in the long run, mainly through increased labor productivity.</span>32</p><p><span class='card-underline'>The IMF study</span> found that immigration had no measurable impact on income distribution in advanced economies. It <span class='card-underline'>found that high-skilled immigration did have a larger benefit for the top 10 percent of earners, but the bottom 90 percent also benefited</span>. Low- and medium-skilled immigration “equally increases income per capita for the bottom 90 percent and the top 10 percent.”33</p><p>Immigration also exerts a positive influence on US government finances. In general, <span class='card-underline'>immigrants tend to produce a fiscal surplus for the federal government, especially for its retirement programs, while imposing more immediate net costs on state and local governments, in particular because of education and </span><span class='card-underline'>incomesupport</span><span class='card-underline'> programs.</span> <span class='card-underline'>High-skilled immigrants produce large fiscal surpluses for the government</span>, while low-skilled immigrants tend to have a negative impact.</p><p>The NASEM report concluded that an immigrant who arrives in the United States at age 25 with a four-year college education will, over his or her lifetime, contribute a net surplus of $504,000 to the finances of governments at all levels (net present value, 2012 dollars). An immigrant with an advanced degree will contribute almost twice that net amount, $972,000, in his or her lifetime. An immigrant with less than a high school education, in contrast, will impose a net cost of $109,000 over his or her lifetime.34 The IMF study notes that such direct, static analysis may underestimate the full fiscal impact of immigration. A more “dynamic scoring” approach would take into account the spillover impact of immigration on productivity and GDP growth for the entire economy, an effect that further boosts tax revenue.35</p><p>In its landmark 2016 study of the economic and fiscal consequences of immigration, <span class='card-underline'>NASEM concluded that immigration unambiguously contributes to US economic growth:</span></p><p>Most obviously, <span class='card-underline'>immigration supplies workers, which increases GDP and has helped the</span> <span class='card-underline'>U</span>nited <span class='card-underline'>S</span>tates <span class='card-underline'>avoid the fate of stagnant economies created by purely demographic forces—in particular, an aging</span> (and, in the case of Japan, a shrinking) <span class='card-underline'>workforce</span>. Perhaps even more important than the contribution to labor supply is <span class='card-underline'>the infusion by high-skilled immigration of human capital</span> that <span class='card-underline'>has boosted the nation’s capacity for innovation and technological change</span>. <span class='card-underline'>The contribution of immigrants to human and physical capital formation, entrepreneurship, and innovation are essential to long-run sustained economic growth.</span> Innovation carried out by immigrants also has the potential to increase the productivity of natives, very likely raising economic growth per capita.

When the economy slips into a funk, the feds can cut taxes and increase spending, thus running a large short-term deficit to combat slow growth. The Federal</span> Reserve <span class='card-underline'>can slash interest rates to encourage corporations to borrow and spend more money than they otherwise would.</span></p><p><span class='card-underline'>The most obvious problem with deploying any recession-busting policies now is, well, the U.S. isn’t in a recession.</span> Quite the opposite: <span class='card-underline'>The economy is nearly at full employment.</span> Interest rates are already low and most economists expect them to do nothing but rise in the next few years, which should discourage investment and growth. <span class='card-underline'>The Republican tax cut, combined with increased spending, will increase the deficit for the next few years—a rarity this deep into a recovery. </span><span class='card-underline'>It’s conceivable that those deficits might provide a bit of a boost. But sustained 3 percent growth isn’t likely</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>.</span></span></p><p>So, <span class='card-underline'>how can a growing economy accelerate?</span> Imagine a factory owner who wants to expand his shoe-manufacturing capacity. The owner can invest in shoelace machines and employee training to increase the per-worker productivity of the factory. He could also simply hire more workers. Just like that hypothetical factory owner, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the economy’s growth </span></span><span class='card-underline'>fundamentally </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>comes from just two things—productivity growth and labor-force growth</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>.</span></p><p><span class='card-underline'>The trouble with rapid productivity growth is that it’s a bit like permanent happiness—much easier to obsess over than to achieve.</span> Indeed, economists obsess over productivity quite a bit, but they often disagree about what increases it, and, as some of them sheepishly admit, they’re not even all that great at measuring it. So far this century, productivity growth in the U.S. has been consistently low—even negative—since the end of the dot-com bubble. <span class='card-underline'>Several studies suggest that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>as rich countries like the U.S. get older, their productivity-growth rates naturally decline</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> (Since there’s a lot about productivity that puzzles economists, they aren’t entirely sure why this happens, either.) <span class='card-underline'>Designing a budget projection around a sudden surge in productivity is a bit like betting one’s life savings on the discovery of alien life on the moon. Not utterly hopeless. But certainly not advisable.</span></p><p>So, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>what’s the trick to raising GDP if productivity levels are subdued? </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>More workers</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span></p><p>In the second half of the 20th century, economic growth in the U.S. rode a labor-force boom, after the Greatest Generation gave birth to the Boomers, then the largest generation in history. But in the last decade, that demographic wind has turned against the U.S.—and most advanced economies. <span class='card-underline'>As the Obama White House said in its 2013 economic report, </span><span class='card-underline'>“</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>real GDP</span></span> in the United States <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is likely to be permanently slower than it was in earlier eras because of a slowdown in labor force growth</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.”</span><span class='card-underline'> It’s not just that population growth is slowing down. What’s more, the share of Americans between 25 and 54 who are working—a statistic known as the “prime age labor participation rate”—has been generally declining since the late 1990s.</span></p><p><span class='card-underline'>There are two simple ways to add more people to the U.S. population: more babies and more immigrants. The trouble with increasing fertility is that no advanced economy seems to have figured out how to do it.</span> The U.S. is in the middle of a protracted lull in baby-making—but so is Scandinavia, and Western Europe, and Japan, and Russia. Low birth rates may simply be a consequence of gender equality and overall prosperity: As a nation’s share of educated women grows, its fertility rate tends to decline, perhaps because working women don’t have the time, money, or interest in raising the sort of large families that were so common (and necessary) in agrarian economies.</p><p>Productivity growth is unpredictable, and fertility growth is elusive. What’s left? Well, there’s immigration. <span class='card-underline'>Achieving higher growth without another baby boom or accelerating productivity isn’t difficult—if the country simply let in more immigrants each year, GDP growth would almost surely accelerate. More able-bodied workers </span><span class='card-underline'>means</span><span class='card-underline'> more work; more work means more production</span>; and product is, after all, the final noun in GDP.</p><p>But <span class='card-underline'>Republicans are</span>, quite publicly, <span class='card-underline'>pursuing the opposite strategy</span>. The immigration legislation from Senators Tom Cotton of Arkansas and David Perdue of Georgia proposes a 50 percent cut to the nation’s immigration levels. The <span class='card-underline'>Trump</span> administration, which <span class='card-underline'>has endorsed the plan</span>, said it wants to reduce legal immigration to the United States by half within the decade.</p><p>This puts the Trump administration’s economic policies in conflict with its economic projections. <span class='card-underline'>Other countries looking to jump-start economic growth in a period of low fertility are liberalizing their immigration policies.</span> Japan, which is further along the aging curve than the U.S., has revamped its immigration laws this century, doubling its share of foreign-born workers (from an admittedly measly 1 percent in the late 1990s to about 2 percent today). <span class='card-underline'>Along with strong monetary stimulus, that doubling of the foreign-born population has contributed to stronger growth than Japan would have had otherwise.</span> As I’ve written, <span class='card-underline'>the economic case for</span> maintaining and even <span class='card-underline'>increasing immigration levels in the U.S. is extremely strong</span>.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>The White House is discouraging talented people from immigrating during a period of low productivity and falling fertility while predicting a growth miracle.</span> All budgets are fantasies.

Economist William Cline once estimated the damage to the United States alone from moderate levels of warming at 1-6 percent of GDP annually; severe warming could cost 13-26 percent of GDP. <span class='card-underline'>But the most frightening scenario is runaway greenhouse warming, based on positive feedback from the buildup of water vapor in the atmosphere that is both caused by and causes hotter surface temperatures.</span><span class='card-underline'> </span>Past ice age transitions, associated with only 5-10 degree changes in average global temperatures, took place in just decades, even though no one was then pouring ever-increasing amounts of carbon into the atmosphere.<span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>Faced with this specter, the best one can conclude is that “</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>humankind’s continuing enhancement of the natural greenhouse effect is akin to playing Russian roulette with the earth’s climate and humanity’s life support system. </span></span><span class='card-underline'>At worst, says physics professor Marty </span><span class='card-underline'>Hoffert</span><span class='card-underline'> of New York University, “</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>we’re </span></span><span class='card-underline'>just </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>going to burn everything up; we’re going to heat the atmosphere </span></span><span class='card-underline'>to the temperature it was in the Cretaceous when there were crocodiles at the poles, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>and then everything will collapse</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.” During the Cold War, astronomer Carl Sagan popularized a theory of nuclear winter to describe how a thermonuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union would not only destroy both countries but possibly end life on this planet. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Global warming is the</span></span><span class='card-underline'> post-Cold War era’s </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>equivalent of nuclear winter</span></span><span class='card-underline'> at least as serious and considerably </span><span class='card-underline'>better supported scientifically</span><span class='card-underline'>.

In February the U.S Citizenship and Immigration Services agency put out a new policy memo requiring "detailed documentation" about H-1B workers employed at third-party work sites to demonstrate that employees are actually filling specialty roles for which they were hired. The move is designed to cut down on "benching" — a practice in which employers hire entry-level software engineers from overseas, pay them the minimum required wage or less and shuffle them to subsidiaries.</p><p>Although it is important to close some of the loopholes in the H-1B visa program, these actions could also have unintended consequences. Often lost in the political rhetoric is the fact that immigration is a critical issue for the U.S. economy and our nation's competitive position. The National Foundation for American Policy found that immigrants have started more than half of the country's billion-dollar start-up companies. Some of the more prominent examples include SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk, from South Africa, and Google co-founder Sergey Brin, an immigrant from the former Soviet Union.</p><p>The H-1B visa is the primary avenue for skilled immigrants to enter the United States. While it's well known that companies in Silicon Valley rely on H-1B visas, it is also used heavily by companies in New York, Texas and Washington, D.C. A recent Pew Research Center report revealed that between 2010 and 2016, almost a third of visas went to businesses in the New York City area. Increased restrictions and rejections of H-1B visas have companies worried.</p><p>Recent reports suggest that restrictions on foreign-born workers could have outsized impact on the tech industry. A recent report from the Silicon Valley Competitiveness and Innovation Project found that the country's largest tech companies rely more on foreign-born workers than domestic ones. In Silicon Valley at least 57 percent of workers in science, tech, engineering and mathematics with a bachelor's degree or higher were born outside the United States, the report said. According to data from the U.S. Department of Labor, IBM applied for 12,381 H-1B visas last year, Microsoft 5,029 visas and Google 4,897.</p><p>Brain drain begins</p><p><span class='card-underline'>For decades</span><span class='card-underline'> the</span> <span class='card-underline'>U</span>nited States <span class='card-underline'>has attracted some of the best and brightest.

Routine applications that were once commonly accepted are now sent back requiring more documentation. H-1B visa extensions are facing more scrutiny. Watson is also seeing a sudden spike in H-1B visa denials.</p><p>While some of the scrutiny is an attempt to close loopholes in the H-1B program, the result is that talented, legitimate applicants are being turned away. Antiimmigration policies will likely hurt American workers, Watson said, noting that for every H-1B worker, five jobs are created. Another visa that would have been a boost to Silicon Valley's start-up scene has also been quashed. The international entrepreneur rule, or start-up visa, would have allowed qualified foreign entrepreneurs to stay in the United States to build businesses. It was set to go into effect last year but has been delayed and looks to be on the chopping block.</p><p>"The shortsightedness will be felt in upcoming months and years. To make America great again, scrutinizing business visas is not the way to go," she said.</p><p>Filling the void</p><p><span class='card-underline'>As the</span> <span class='card-underline'>U</span>nited <span class='card-underline'>S</span>tates <span class='card-underline'>closes its borders, other countries are courting the world's best and brightest to come and start businesses</span><span class='card-highlight'>.</span> France introduced a new tech visa program last year, and French president Emmanuel Macron has said he aims to make France a "Startup Nation." Canada launched a program to fast-track visas and short-term work permits for highly skilled foreign workers. When the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services department said in June they would stop premium processing of H-1B visas for up to six months, Canada stepped up and said it would fast-track applications. India's commerce ministry and various government arms have created innovation labs and incubators in efforts to develop the country's start-up scene, while China has vowed to invest vigorously in artificial intelligence to create a $150 billion industry by 2030.</p><p>"In the wake of our administration's policies, it's becoming easier for others to fill the void," said David Brown, a serial entrepreneur and founder of Techstars, which helps start-ups through accelerator programs and investment. Brown said that Techstar's Toronto program is reaping the benefit of entrepreneurs who are leaving the United States for Canada.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Whether the current tide of people leaving becomes a wave has yet to be determined.</span> But meanwhile, <span class='card-underline'>"the rhetoric has got people really stressed.

While the ongoing trade war is grabbing all the headlines, it's the tussle for dominance in the A.I. space that could shape the economic fortunes of the two world powers. Overshadowed by the dazzling A.I. advances made by the United States so far, China has been silently but resolutely building an ecosystem that is feeding and fueling its ambition to become a world leader in A.I. by 2030.</p><p>Home to tech behemoths like Google, Microsoft, IBM and Apple, the United States is where the bulk of A.I. innovation has taken place. However, <span class='card-underline'>there are growing indications that China, with its own army of tech heavy hitters</span> such as Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu, <span class='card-underline'>is moving rapidly to close the gap</span>. For one, <span class='card-underline'>the Asian economic giant has all the ingredients it needs to upstage Silicon Valley: generous government coffers, large population, a thriving research community and a society eager for technological change</span>. Its investment in A.I., chips and electrics cars combined has been estimated at $300 billion.</p><p>In line with its 2030 vision, the government of Tianjin, a city a couple of hours from Beijing, plans to build a $5 billion fund to support the A.I. development. Money being no object, China is also building a giant $2.1 billion technology park to facilitate A.I. innovation. In a red-hot market for tech, China's A.I. start-ups can raise funds with relative ease. Investors poured $4.5 billion into more than 200 Chinese A.I. companies between 2012 and 2017, according to a white paper produced by Kai-Fu Lee, a former Google and Microsoft executive who now leads a venture-capital firm, Sinovation Ventures.</p><p>China's goal is to foster a $1 trillion A.I. industry by 2030. Last month Chinese A.I. start-up SenseTime raised $600 million in a deal led by Alibaba, reported as the largest-ever in the A.I. space. The deal gave SenseTime an implied valuation in some reports of more than $3 billion, or even as high as $4.5 billion.</p><p>"SenseTime is the perfect case study in the difference between Chinese and Western technological development," wrote Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, in a recent report. "Artificial intelligence, and especially the A.I. that powers visual analytics, is a critical technology for a raft of new products. The Western companies have their own advantages, to be sure. But the Chinese model of government sponsorship and private capital is coming on very strong. SenseTime may be the hit investment of the moment coming out of this approach, but it certainly won't be the last."</p><p>US research sector could struggle</p><p>By contrast, the U.S. research sector could be struggling for funding and policy support under the Trump administration. The American Association for the Advancement of Science said the White House planned to slash science and technology research funding by 15 percent in 2018. Worse, <span class='card-underline'>with the recent immigration clampdown, the</span> <span class='card-underline'>U</span>nited <span class='card-underline'>S</span>tates <span class='card-underline'>may soon be struggling to attract and retain highly skilled tech experts from around the world that it needs to keep Silicon Valley at the cutting edge of A.I. research and innovation</span>.</p><p>There are indications <span class='card-underline'>America's grasp of A.I. primacy may already be slipping</span>. According to the White House's National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan in A.I. research, China had already surpassed the United States, at least in terms of journal articles that mention "deep learning" or "deep neural network," as far back as 2016.</p><p>"Sadly, when it comes to science and innovation, the U.S. is moving in reverse by cutting funding for research, denying climate change and cutting investments in education," said Vivek Wadhwa, a distinguished fellow and adjunct professor at Carnegie Mellon University's College of Engineering and author of The Driver in the Driverless Car: How Our Technology Choices Will Create the Future.</p><p>U.S. leaders do not appear to be aware of A.I. developments, said Joshua Gans, business professor at the University of Toronto and co-author of Prediction Machines: The Simple Economics of Artificial Intelligence. "President Obama discussed it [AI] on numerous occasions," he said. "[Research funding cuts] is obviously bad news in terms of its ability to nurture scientific leadership. It is shortsighted and will harm the U.S. in the medium-long term."</p><p>China's timeline for global A.I. supremacy by 2030 may appear a tad overambitious, but opinions are divided as to whether it's achievable.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Wadhwa</span>, for one, <span class='card-underline'>feels China has many obstacles. "Governments can't make innovation by throwing money at it — this only leads to more corruption and bureaucracy,"</span> he said. <span class='card-underline'>"Innovation comes from people who have diverse ideas, take risks and challenge authority."</span></p><p>Wadhwa's reservation contrasts with the conviction of William Weightman, a Fulbright Fellow researching intellectual property law in China. "While 12 years seems like a short amount of time to achieve such an ambitious target, it's not outside China's scope," said Weightman. "The world should not underestimate China's ability to mobilize a vast amount of resources to accomplish its goals."</p><p>He used the example of the first high-speed rail line connecting Beijing and Tianjin, which was completed just in time for the 2008 Beijing Olympics. "Between the vast amount of state resources and the determination of the central leadership, China has a solid foundation on which to build an innovative A.I. sector," Weightman said.</p><p>China's potential advantages are many</p><p>China's demographics give it an unmatched advantage. The Asian giant has large consumer data (which fuels A.I.), scant regulation restricting the use of it, a supportive government both in terms of policy and funding, a population not overly concerned about privacy and a vigorous tech start-up culture that now boasts one-third of the world's unicorns — start-ups valued at $1 billion or more.</p><p>Wadhwa conceded China clearly had an advantage in data, the key to training today's A.I., but said its importance may be overstated. "There will be a new generation of technologies that don't require as much data," he said. "New A.I. techniques which [will] work much differently than today's."</p><p><span class='card-underline'>It may</span> also <span class='card-underline'>turn out that </span><span class='card-underline'>other things are more important than data, like a culture of innovation and scientific research</span>. And <span class='card-underline'>while there is uncertainty around government support for scientific research, </span><span class='card-underline'>"the U.S. still has the most vibrant innovative economy,"</span> Gans said.

"In risk-taking and technology development, China is only a child, where America is the leader."</p><p>Gans said the freer hand of U.S. companies may also be an advantage. "China's tech giants do not operate independently of government, and there is much uncertainty there," he said. "Their U.S. counterparts are freer on many important dimensions."</p><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>There is</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>,</span> however, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>little disagreement over the</span></span><span class='card-underline'> potentially </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>damaging long-term impact of the U.S. immigration policies, an area where America's loss could be China's gain.</span></span></p><p><span class='card-underline'>"</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>America's immigration policies are clearly slowing down progress by sending great people home and preventing the world's best and brightest from coming here</span></span><span class='card-underline'>,"</span> Wadhwa said.

Weeks earlier, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology released a three-year development plan for AI, part of a larger initiative launched in July 2017 that includes specific goals for such technologies as artificial neural network processing chips, intelligent robots, automated vehicles, intelligent medical diagnosis, intelligent drones and machine translation. China's Ministry of Science and Technology announced in November 2017 that it had formed a sort of dream team made up of the biggest Chinese tech firms — Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent — to lead the country's AI development alongside voice recognition software developer iFlytek. Each of these companies is hard at work cultivating the learning algorithms and hardware, and gathering the data, necessary to build a wide range of functional AI platforms. Baidu, for instance, has started developing open-source programs, such as the autonomous driving platform Apollo, to collect as much data as possible.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Nor is the importance of AI lost on the U.S. Department of Defense.</span> Like his predecessor, Ash Carter, <span class='card-underline'>Secretary of Defense</span> James <span class='card-underline'>Mattis supports the Pentagon's Defense Innovation Unit Experimental</span> (DIUx), despite calls from Republican lawmakers to roll the project into the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. <span class='card-underline'>DIUx</span><span class='card-underline'>, headquartered in Silicon Valley, aims to ensure that the military can quickly adapt and integrate innovations that come out of California's tech hub</span>. To that end, it awarded tech firm C3 IoT a contract late last year to develop an AI platform for the Air Force to predict when aircraft and equipment need maintenance.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>In the quest to hone its AI capabilities, the Defense Department hasn't lost sight of China's own progress with the technology.</span> The country's sheer size sets it apart from other tech innovators such as South Korea or Japan; <span class='card-underline'>China could scale up its rapidly increasing tech abilities and use them against the</span> <span class='card-underline'>U</span>nited <span class='card-underline'>S</span>tates <span class='card-underline'>in a way that not even Russia has managed</span>. With that in mind, <span class='card-underline'>Mattis made China's rise in tech a centerpiece of his National Defense Strategy, </span><span class='card-underline'>highlighting the U.S. government's need to strengthen ties with emerging tech companies, including AI startups</span>.</p><p>[graph omitted]</p><p>A Space Race for the 21st Century</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Today's mad dash for AI isn't the first technology race the</span> <span class='card-underline'>U</span>nited <span class='card-underline'>S</span>tates <span class='card-underline'>has run. During the Cold War, the country vied against the Soviet Union to develop a variety of aerospace, nuclear and computing innovations.</span> Washington emerged victorious from that contest; though the Soviet Union focused its efforts almost exclusively on military applications, it lacked the research and development capacity of the United States. The size of its critical industries enabled the United States to outstrip the Soviet Union in military technology while still diverting some of its attention and resources to consumer products.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Like the Soviet Union, China is interested more in national security and defense than it is in the commercial sector. The difference lies in China's size and in its economy.</span></p><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The country's immensity could make it a more even match for the</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>U</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>nited </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>S</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>tates </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>in terms of developing and adopting emerging technologies</span></span>. Given that the country's population exceeds 1.3 billion people — and that data privacy is a low priority for Beijing — <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>China offers its AI companies a big leg-up over their U.S. competitors by giving them access to a huge pool of data</span></span>. Furthermore, <span class='card-underline'>unlike the tightly controlled Soviet economy that hindered innovation, China's hybrid economy offers individuals and companies incentive to push the boundaries in tech development</span>. The country's model of capitalism isn't one of control, though Western media often portray Chinese tech firms as dependent on Beijing to subsidize and direct their activities. Instead, <span class='card-underline'>the central government outlines areas in which it would like companies to operate and provides incentives to encourage competition. AI is one of those areas, and China's tech giants are eager to outpace one another in the field</span>. Aware that it missed the boat with smartphone technology, Baidu, for instance, has set its sights on AI as its opportunity to get an advantage over Tencent, Alibaba and Huawei.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>For now, China </span><span class='card-underline'>lags behind</span><span class='card-underline'> the</span> <span class='card-underline'>U</span>nited <span class='card-underline'>S</span>tates <span class='card-underline'>in the tech race, especially in semiconductor development.

The challenge for Washington will be that, unlike earlier dual-use technologies, <span class='card-underline'>AI applications will immediately have profound implications for the consumer electronics market</span>. <span class='card-underline'>And because the Chinese and U.S. economies are highly integrated</span> with each other, <span class='card-underline'>China's achievements even in the commercial sector pose a serious threat to the</span> <span class='card-underline'>U</span>nited <span class='card-underline'>S</span>tates. <span class='card-underline'>The question for the</span> <span class='card-underline'>U</span>nited <span class='card-underline'>S</span>tates <span class='card-underline'>isn't so much whether China can surpass it in the race to harness emerging technologies; it's </span><span class='card-underline'>how close the Asian country will come to doing so</span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> <span class='card-underline'>China is large enough that its tech sector could give Silicon Valley a run for its money in terms of market share if it even comes close to producing the same technologies.</span> For that reason, many U.S. tech firms are trying to withhold some of their advancements from defense applications in hopes of maintaining a competitive edge in the commercial sphere.</p><p>Building a Strategy</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Once upon a time the</span> <span class='card-underline'>U</span>nited <span class='card-underline'>S</span>tates <span class='card-underline'>could rest easy in the knowledge that no other country could match its combination of physical size and technological ability. Now China can.</span> As a result, the current U.S. administration is working to develop a more robust response to the United States' budding rival. The White House's investigations into China's intellectual property policies, calls for greater scrutiny of its foreign investment activities and even proposals to nationalize the fifth generation wireless protocol, or 5G, network are all initial attempts to counter the country's rise in technology. So far, though, these initiatives have only provoked backlash in the United States.</p><p>Forging a comprehensive strategy against China will become all the more important for Washington as time goes by. <span class='card-underline'>The dizzying pace and unpredictable trajectory of innovation compels tech companies to constantly broaden their horizons or else jeopardize their competitiveness.</span> But as the same firms expand their services into more and more industries, they risk running afoul of U.S. antitrust laws. The more companies such as Google, Amazon and Apple Inc. grow, the bigger the targets on their backs become. Antitrust investigations and busts in the United States, in turn, could give Chinese companies a prime opportunity to catch up to their competition.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'><span class='card-highlight'>Tech superiority allows the U.S. to both </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>deter and win</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> conflicts</span></div><div class='cite'><span class='card-highlight'>England, 17</span> --- former secretary of the Navy and deputy secretary of Defense and currently the chairman of the National Academy of Engineering (12/6/17, Gordon, “US is losing ground on technology superiority,” http://thehill.com/opinion/technology/363621-us-is-losing-ground-on-technology-superiority, accessed on 6/5/18, JMP)</div><div class='card-body'><p><span class='card-underline'>A long-held military maxim is to take the high ground and hold it.</span> That may be outdated in today’s electronic and high-tech battlefields, but <span class='card-underline'>that notion still holds true for scientific research and engineering</span>. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Research is the foundation for </span></span><span class='card-underline'>engineering </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>invention, </span></span><span class='card-underline'>and that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>leadership in engineering underpins our national security and economy.</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Retaining the high ground in research and engineering is necessary to deter future conflicts, win future wars</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and maintain our standard of living.</span></p><p>Modern research started about 500 years ago with the development of the printing press.

This same process continues today but with a more organized and funded research structure.</p><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>For the U.S., the federal commitment to research was made after World War II and housed in the Department of Defense</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> This decision was largely driven by the need to confront a new enemy — the USSR. That federal commitment to research and engineering generated U.S. military and economic superiority, helping to seal victory in the Cold War. It also led to early-generation microelectronics, nuclear power, GPS and the internet, among dozens more transformational discoveries and many with both military and commercial applications.</p><p>How did all this happen? <span class='card-underline'>The department recognized the need to stay technically ahead of the enemy.</span> The answer was <span class='card-underline'>a network of research laboratories</span> that <span class='card-underline'>carried out critical research to advance military technology</span>, much of it also fueling the domestic economy. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The department still has this </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>structure</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> but it is now part of a much larger government research and innovation ecosystem that is in </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>partnership with commercial sector research</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>.</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span></p><p>In addition to the Defense Department, out of necessity to be globally competitive, <span class='card-underline'>the research effort now includes</span> the Department of Energy, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, <span class='card-underline'>university and philanthropy-funded research and a myriad of technology-based companies</span>. </p><p><span class='card-underline'>Defense Secretary</span> Jim <span class='card-underline'>Mattis indicated the need for this broad inter-agency and commercial research effort</span> in his testimony to the House Armed Services Committee. <span class='card-underline'>“New commercial technologies</span> will change society, and ultimately, they will <span class='card-underline'>change the character of war,”</span> Mattis said. <span class='card-underline'>We must carry out research, “recognize its military potential, and develop new capabilities.”</span></p><p>Yet, <span class='card-underline'>we’re seemingly not doing enough to keep the research high ground</span>. The Heritage Foundation recently released its index of military strength. After analyzing various essential components, Heritage ranked the capability of the U.S. Army and U.S. Marines as “marginal” and the U.S. Navy as “weak.” Reviews of our nation’s research capability — by Information Technology and Innovation Foundation and the American Academy of Arts & Science — likewise show that we’re losing ground. <span class='card-underline'>Assessments</span> like these are always problematic, but they <span class='card-underline'>all indicate a common troubling finding: The U.S. is on a downward trend.</span></p><p>What this means is that our federal laboratories and research institutions aren’t aggressive enough and that <span class='card-underline'>the Defense Department is not reaping the rewards of the larger and more competitive commercial sector. Without the competition in the commercial sector that drives rapid innovation and engineering application, the government programs lack urgency.</span> Agencies relying on up-to-date technology and innovation all need bolder and more urgent research plans, and Defense Department needs to more quickly convert the research results into engineering applications to deter, and when necessary, win future conflicts. </p><p>Equally important, all these agencies need to break through the barrier of accessing research from the commercial sector. Token steps have been taken but a necessary first step to attract the commercial sector is to dramatically reduce bureaucracy. For the Defense Department that means shaving the voluminous pages of acquisition regulations. </p><p>There are very few eureka moments when it comes to scientific breakthroughs.

In particular, <span class='card-underline'>nuclear</span><span class='card-underline'> deterrence played a significant role in the way the U.S. built its national security strategy</span>. Nuclear deterrence was so pervasive that the very word “deterrence” itself became synonymous with nuclear deterrence. However, according to General John Hyten, Commander, U.S. Strategic Command, strategic deterrence in the 21st century does not equate to 20th century deterrence. <span class='card-underline'>Strategic deterrence is a multi-polar, multi-domain problem and it is fundamentally different now than it was in last century. The myopic focus on nuclear options</span> in a national deterrence strategy <span class='card-underline'>falls short of the critical thinking required to provide U.S. national leaders with the options necessary for effective decision making.</span> Today’s complex social-political environment requires more than just a nuclear element for strategic deterrence to be effective against a diverse set of adversaries. Deterrence today must leverage all six domains of warfare.</p><p>So what is deterrence? According to DoD Joint Publication 1, deterrence “influences potential adversaries not to take threatening actions” for fear of the overwhelming retaliation from U.S. military might. More simply, deterrence could be any action that convinces an adversary to not act due to perceived unacceptable costs or because “the probability of success [is assessed to be] extremely low.” For an adversary to believe costs will be unacceptable or that there is a low probability of success, it must assess the U.S. threat as credible and capable, regardless of whether it is nuclear or conventional. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Deterrence hinges on the adversary’s assessment of credibility and capability</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. </span>During the Cold War the Soviet Union believed that use of nuclear weapons would lead to an overwhelming retaliation from the U.S.; and therefore, striking any NATO allies with nuclear weapons was not worth the cost.</p><p>Effects of a Multi-Polar Environment</p><p>The end of the Cold War brought to a close 50 years of a bi-polar world, and with it the simplicity of employing one strategy to deter a single adversary. <span class='card-underline'>The multi-polar world of today brings adversaries who are motivated differently. Both rational and irrational actors must be considered</span>, which also causes national leaders to question the level of success strategic deterrence has on an adversary. Generally, it is believed strategic deterrence is effective only against a rational actor, and not an irrational actor. This is due to the perception that a rational actor will take into account some form of cost-benefit analysis prior to acting versus the irrational actor who might act without any consideration of the losses.</p><p>Further complicating the world environment is that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>potential adversaries are watching and learning from U.S actions</span></span>. This is not a new concept as adversaries have been studying each other for thousands of years to gain advantage. But General Hyten reminded us in a speech last fall that “in a multi-polar world, everybody watches you [the U.S.] everywhere.” His point was to highlight that <span class='card-underline'>since the fall of the Soviet Union</span>, the U.S. has had a spotlight on it where <span class='card-underline'>adversaries have been studying the asymmetric advantages of the U.S. and creating specific capabilities and methods to counter those advantages</span>. Thus, we must now recognize that <span class='card-underline'>a deterrent method of the past may not be viable in the future</span><span class='card-underline'>. The U.S. must seek out new deterrent strategies.</span></p><p>Nuclear versus Strategic Deterrence</p><p>Nuclear deterrence remains the foundation of U.S. deterrence strategy. However, nuclear deterrence cannot be the sole pillar of strategic deterrence since nuclear deterrence is not a one-size-fits-all solution. The most recent National Security Strategy (NSS) reflects this requirement to expand deterrence. As Brian Willis points out in the recent “Multi-domain ops at the Strategic Level” article, the recent NSS and Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) make strides to extend deterrence to the space and cyberspace domains. <span class='card-underline'>Creating non-nuclear deterrence options for use against potential adversaries is critical, especially against those actors who do not possess nuclear weapons.</span> Michael Gerson suggests <span class='card-underline'>the nuclear taboo reduces the credibility—and therefore the utility—of nuclear weapons, especially against regimes not possessing nuclear weapons or</span> other <span class='card-underline'>w</span>eapons of <span class='card-underline'>m</span>ass <span class='card-underline'>d</span>estruction. This thought process feeds back to the concept of credibility. The <span class='card-underline'>adversary must know the capability exists and the U.S. is willing to use it. The U.S. must consider a more balanced approach to deterrence as two of its near-peer adversaries have done. China and Russia are starting to demonstrate new ideas and concepts about strategic deterrence.</span> This new “deterrence” does not solely focus on nuclear weapons or even the military instrument of power. China defines this new way of thinking as “Integrated Strategic Deterrence” while the Russians have called it “Cross-Domain Coercion.”</p><p>People’s Republic of China Approach to Deterrence</p><p>The PRC’s approach is not focused on preventing actions in a given domain but about achieving certain political goals. Around 2001, PRC military literature started discussing a concept known as “Integrated Strategic Deterrence” which focuses on nonmilitary aspects of national power—diplomatic, economic, and scientific and technological strength—contributing to strategic deterrence alongside space and cyber capabilities. These actions could include demonstrating new capabilities through tests and exercises where international observers are watching, owning the majority of mineral mines that hold a certain type of element, or working with partner countries to launch a new satellite that helps map future droughts and plots areas that are farmable.</p><p>In 2007, the PRC tested an antisatellite (ASAT) technology demonstrator against a non-operational weather satellite. This test was publicized as a future scientific technology demonstration. This test demonstrated the PRC had a capability to engage satellites in Low Earth Orbit, which has now been turned over to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and is considered an operational military capability. It is also now a credible strategic deterrent in the space domain.</p><p>Another piece to the PRC’s deterrence is their dam building operations for water control and hydropower. According to open sources, the PRC owns 45% of the world’s dams with its nearest competitors being the United States at 14% and India at 9%. Dams have the potential to turn water into political weapons to be wielded in war, or instruments during peace to influence actions or behaviors of a neighbor. India is currently concerned with a number of China dam projects and their ability to reduce river flows into India.</p><p>The PRC’s “Integrated Strategic Deterrence” does not come without challenges. Unlike the U.S. who has the Department of Defense and Department of State coordinating different types of deterrent actions, the absence of an entity in the PLA to integrate and coordinate the employment of these capabilities makes it difficult to execute. However, it would come as no surprise to the casual observer to see the PLA start executing military, space, and cyber coercive activities in national level exercises in order to move “Integrated Strategic Deterrence” from theory and conjecture to fully operational in limited regional conflicts.</p><p>Russia’s Approach to Deterrence</p><p>The PRC is not the only competitor thinking about strategic deterrence from a non-nuclear perspective. About 30 years ago, Soviet literature introduced a concept we now know as Reflexive Control. This notion centers on the idea of driving your opponent to make decisions that are advantageous to you. This is commonly achieved through misinformation, either via “leaks” or providing a possible explanation to an unrelated event that causes your opponent to divert attention or respond. That concept has now evolved into “Cross-Domain Coercion.”</p><p>“Cross Domain Coercion” is Russia’s ability to orchestrate non-nuclear and informational influence to coerce an adversary. It maintains opaqueness that clouds the nature of aggression as well as the aggressor’s identity. This informational influence was apparent during both the United States elections in 2016 and Catalonia’s bid for independence from Spain in 2017. Multiple United States intelligence agencies have noted Russian misinformation on social media and mass media outlets. This campaign is a prime example of “Cross Domain Coercion” and used a soft instrument of power, in this case information, as a form of deterrence on a global scale. The purpose of this interference is still clouded but it must have satisfied Russian objectives if it was used in Catalonia months after the United States election.</p><p>Another form of this type of deterrence is Russia’s cyber-attacks in both Estonia in 2007, and Georgia in 2008. In both cases, the attacks were not solely focused on military targets but against government institutions, banks, ministries, newspapers, and broadcasters. These attacks were meant to confuse the population and drive the government towards compliance with Russian demands.</p><p>Whatever the objectives, Russia has telegraphed that future attacks will fall under “Cross Domain Coercion”. The threats against financial and economic institutions as well as those of energy sources will be activated in conjunction with the military component of coercion, such as special operations forces and strategic strike systems in order to influence the target country. With both the PRC and Russia, strategic deterrence is no longer monopolized by nuclear weapons. 21st century deterrence is dam building that has regional implications on precious resources and misinformation campaigns such as Deepfakes where machine learning systems can be trained to paste one person’s face onto another person’s body, complete with facial expressions, and could change the outcome of democratic elections.</p><p>U.S. Multi-Domain Strategic Deterrence</p><p>Consideration of deterrent effects other than kinetic weapons must be explored. <span class='card-underline'>Strategic deterrence “applies to cyber, it applies to missile defense, and it applies to electronic warfare. It applies to every mission in U.S. Strategic Command.”</span> Currently, <span class='card-underline'>an adversarial attack can come through any domain, and that is why the U.S. must leverage the multiplicative advantages of all domains</span>. An adversary who is not deterred by a nuclear response may be deterred by fear of a cyber effect which degrades or destroys a country’s economic stability. Or it could be negotiations in the human domain which threaten sanctions against a country’s ability to trade. Maybe it is the threat of an information operations campaign with the goal of removing a governmental regime from power and destabilizing a nation state. Regardless of deterrence method, the adversary must perceive the U.S. as capable and willing to commit to the action for it to be an effective deterrent. The first step for the U.S. is talking about capabilities more openly so adversaries know about our capabilities and the conditions under which they would be employed. This does not mean we share the technical details of a capability, those should remain secret, but a general understanding of the effect created by the capability must be understood. Adversaries are not deterred by a capability if they do not know it exists.</p><p>Future Technologies and Deterrence</p><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Technologies on the horizon have huge implications for the future of strategic deterrence</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> Hypersonic weapons have the capability of delivering multiple payload types to worldwide targets while rendering missile warning detection and missile defense programs obsolete.</p><p>Quantum computing has the ability to make encryption unbreakable unless you have quantum technology and increase transmission speeds to levels unheard of in today’s environment. This could deter an adversary from ever trying to break your encryption unless they spend the money to harness quantum computing. Finally, <span class='card-underline'>Artificial Intelligence</span> (AI) <span class='card-underline'>and “combat cloud” services allow computers to easily share information and make decisions involving civil and economic processes to military tasks without ever needing human interaction</span>. AI comes with colossal opportunities, but also threats that are difficult to predict. <span class='card-underline'>According to Putin</span>, <span class='card-highlight'>whoever </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>becomes the leader in AI will become the ruler of the world</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>.</span></p><p>Leading the Target</p><p>The one commonality in the previous paragraph is that the U.S. is arguably not the leader in any of the technologies listed above. The question is why. The U.S. recognizes the threat but does not seem to recognize deterrence in the same lenses as our adversaries. With all of the historic examples above plus the developing technologies, our adversaries are coming up with new deterrence strategies that go beyond nuclear weapons. <span class='card-underline'>If the U.S. wants credible 21st century strategic deterrence, we need to look no further than recent PRC and Russian actions.

If the U.S. does not act soon, we could be deterred from intervening in future conflicts that protects our vital interests or closest allies.</span></p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'><span class='card-highlight'>Global crises are </span><span class='card-highlight'>inevitable</span><span class='card-highlight'> – failure to preserve deterrence risks </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>escalation</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> and </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>nuclear war</span></span> </div><div class='cite'><span class='card-highlight'>Traverton</span> <span class='card-highlight'>17</span> (Gregory Treverton, former president of the Pacific Council on International Policy, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, Chairman, National Intelligence Council, “Global Trends: Paradox of Progress,” January 2017, https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/nic/GT-Full-Report.pdf) </div><div class='card-body'><p>These <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>global trends</span></span>, challenging governance and changing the nature of power, will drive major consequences over the next five years. They <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>will </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>raise tensions</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> across all regions</span></span> and types of governments, both within and between countries. These near-term conditions will contribute to the expanding threat from terrorism <span class='card-underline'>and leave the future of international order in the balance</span>. Within countries, tensions are rising because citizens are raising basic questions about what they can expect from their governments in a constantly changing world. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Publics</span></span> are <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>push</span></span>ing <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>governments</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> to provide</span></span><span class='card-underline'> peace and </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>prosperity</span></span> more broadly and reliably at home when what happens abroad is increasingly shaping those conditions. In turn, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>these dynamics</span></span> are increasing tensions between countries—<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>heighten</span></span>ing<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> the </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>risk of interstate conflict</span></span> during the next five years. A hobbled Europe, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>uncertainty about </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>America’s role</span></span><span class='card-underline'> in the world</span>, <span class='card-underline'>and weakened norms for conflict-prevention</span> and human rights <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>create openings</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>for </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>China</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> and </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Russia</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>.</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>The combination will also embolden regional and nonstate aggressors—breathing new life into regional rivalries, such as between Riyadh and Tehran, Islamabad and New Delhi, and on the Korean Peninsula. Governance shortfalls also will drive threat perceptions and insecurity in countries such as Pakistan and North Korea. Economic interdependence among major powers remains a check on aggressive behavior but might be insufficient in itself to prevent a future conflict. Major and middle powers alike will search for ways to reduce the types of interdependence that leaves them vulnerable to economic coercion and financial sanctions, potentially providing them more freedom of action to aggressively pursue their interests. Meanwhile, <span class='card-underline'>the threat from terrorism is likely to expand</span> as the ability of states, groups, and individuals to impose harm diversifies. The net effect of rising tensions within and between countries—and the growing threat from terrorism—will be greater global disorder and considerable questions about the rules, institutions, and distribution of power in the international system. Europe. Europe’s sharpening tensions and doubts about its future cohesion stem from institutions mismatched to its economic and security challenges. EU institutions set monetary policy for Eurozone states, but state capitals retain fiscal and security responsibilities—leaving poorer members saddled with debt and diminished growth prospects and each state determining its own approach to security. Public frustration with immigration, slow growth, and unemployment will fuel nativism and a preference for national solutions to continental problems. Outlook: Europe is likely to face additional shocks—banks remain unevenly capitalized and regulated, migration within and into Europe will continue, and Brexit will encourage regional and separatist movements in other European countries. Europe’s aging population will undermine economic output, shift consumption toward services—like health care—and away from goods and investment. A shortage of younger workers will reduce tax revenues, fueling debates over immigration to bolster the workforce. The EU’s future will hinge on its ability to reform its institutions, create jobs and growth, restore trust in elites, and address public concerns that immigration will radically alter national cultures. United States. <span class='card-underline'>The next five years will test US resilience</span>. As in Europe, <span class='card-underline'>tough economic times have brought out societal and class divisions</span>. Stagnant wages and rising income inequality are fueling doubts about global economic integration and the “American Dream” of upward mobility. The share of American men age 25- 54 not seeking work is at the highest level since the Great Depression. <span class='card-underline'>Median incomes rose by 5 percent in 2015</span>, however, <span class='card-underline'>and there are signs of renewal in some communities</span> where real estate is affordable, returns on foreign and domestic investment are high, leveraging of immigrant talent is the norm, and expectations of federal assistance are low, according to contemporary observers. Outlook: Despite signs of economic improvement, <span class='card-underline'>challenges will be significant, with public trust in leaders and institutions sagging</span>, politics highly polarized, <span class='card-underline'>and government revenue constrained</span> by modest growth and rising entitlement outlays. Moreover, advances in robotics and artificial intelligence are likely to further disrupt labor markets. Meanwhile, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>uncertainty</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> is high </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>around the world</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> regarding Washington’s </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>global leadership role</span></span>. The United States has rebounded from troubled times before, however, such as when the period of angst in the 1970s was followed by a stronger economic recovery and global role in the world. Innovation at the state and local level, flexible financial markets, tolerance for risk-taking, and a demographic profile more balanced than most large countries offer upside potential. Finally, America is distinct because it was founded on an inclusive ideal—the pursuit of life, liberty, and happiness for all, however imperfectly realized—rather than a race or ethnicity. This legacy remains a critical advantage for managing divisions. <span class='card-underline'>Central and South America</span>. Although state weakness and drug trafficking have and will continue to beset Central America, South America has been more stable than most regions of the world and has had many democratic advances—including recovery from populist waves from the right and the left. However, <span class='card-underline'>government efforts to provide greater economic and social stability are running up against budget and debt constraints</span>. Weakened international demand for commodities has slowed growth. The expectations associated with new entrants to the middle class will strain public coffers, fuel political discontent, and possibly jeopardize the region’s significant progress against poverty and inequality. Activist civil society organizations are likely to fuel social tensions by increasing awareness of elite corruption, inadequate infrastructure, and mismanagement. Some incumbents facing possible rejection by their publics are seeking to protect their power, which could lead to a period of intense political competition and democratic backsliding in some countries. Violence is particularly rampant in northern Central America, as gangs and organized criminal groups have undermined basic governance by regimes that lack capacity to provide many basic public goods and services. Outlook: <span class='card-underline'>Central and South America are likely to see more frequent changes in governments that are mismanaging the economy and beleaguered by widespread corruption</span>. Leftist administrations already have lost power in places like Argentina, Guatemala, and Peru and are on the defensive in Venezuela, although new leaders will not have much time to show they can improve conditions. The success or failure of Mexico’s high-profile reforms might affect the willingness of other countries in the region to take similar political risks. The OECD accession process may be an opportunity—and incentive— for some countries to improve economic policies in a region with fairly balanced age demographics, significant energy resources, and well-established economic links to Asia, Europe, and the United States. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>An </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Inward West</span></span>? Among the industrial democracies of North America, Europe, Japan, South Korea, and Australia, leaders will search for ways to restore a sense of middle class wellbeing while some attempt to temper populist and nativist impulses. The result <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>could</span></span> be a more inwardly focused West than we have experienced in decades, which will <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>seek to avoid</span></span> <span class='card-underline'>costly </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>foreign adventures</span></span> while experimenting with domestic schemes to address fiscal limits, demographic problems, and wealth concentrations. This inward view will be far more pronounced in the European Union, which is absorbed by questions of EU governance and domestic challenges, than elsewhere. The European Union’s internal divisions, demographic woes, and moribund economic performance threaten its own status as a global player. For the coming five years at least, the need to restructure European relations in light of the UK’s decision to leave the EU will undermine the region’s international clout and could weaken transatlantic cooperation, while anti-immigration sentiments among the region’s populations will undermine domestic political support for Europe’s political leaders. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Questions</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> about the</span></span> <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>U</span></span>nited <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>S</span></span>tates’ <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>role in the world </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>center</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> on what the </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>country can afford</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>and what its </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>public will support</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> in</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>backing allies</span></span>, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>managing conflict</span></span>, and overcoming its own divisions. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Foreign</span></span> publics and <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>governments </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>will be </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>watching Washington</span></span> <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>for signs of compromise</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and cooperation,</span> focusing especially on global trade, tax reform, workforce preparedness for advanced technologies, race relations, and its openness to experimentation at the state and local levels. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Lack</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> of </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>domestic progress</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> would </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>signal</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> a shift </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>toward retrenchment</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, a weaker middle class, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>and</span></span><span class='card-underline'> potentially </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>further global drift </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>into disorder </span></span><span class='card-underline'>and </span><span class='card-underline'>regional spheres of influence.</span> Yet, America’s capital, both human and security, is immense. Much of the world’s best talent seeks to live and work in the United States, and domestic and global hope for a competent and constructive foreign policy remain high. China. <span class='card-underline'>China faces a daunting test</span>—with its political stability in the balance. After three decades of historic economic growth and social change, <span class='card-underline'>Beijing, amid slower growth and the aftereffects of a debt binge, is transitioning from an investment-driven, export-based economy to one fueled by domestic consumption. </span>Satisfying the demands of its new middle classes for clean air, affordable houses, improved services, and continued opportunities will be essential for the government to maintain legitimacy and political order. President Xi’s consolidation of power could threaten an established system of stable succession, while <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Chinese nationalism</span></span>—a force Beijing occasionally encourages for support when facing foreign friction—<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>may prove hard to control</span></span>. Outlook: <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Beijing</span></span><span class='card-underline'> probably has</span> ample <span class='card-underline'>resources to prop up growth while efforts to spur private consumption take hold.</span> Nonetheless, the more it “doubles down” on state owned enterprises (SOEs) in the economy, the more it <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>will be at</span></span> greater <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>risk of </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>financial shocks</span></span> that cast doubt on its ability to manage the economy. Automation and competition from lowcost producers elsewhere in Asia and even Africa will put pressure on wages for unskilled workers. The country’s rapidly shrinking working-age population will act as a strong headwind to growth. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Russia</span></span>. Russia’s <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>aspires to </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>restore</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> its </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>great power status</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>through </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>nationalism</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, military modernization, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>nuclear saber rattling</span></span>, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>and</span></span> <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>foreign engagements</span></span><span class='card-underline'> abroad</span>. Yet, at home, it faces increasing constraints as its stagnant economy heads into a third consecutive year of recession. Moscow prizes stability and order, offering Russians security at the expense of personal freedoms and pluralism. <span class='card-underline'>Moscow’s ability to retain a role on the global stage</span>—even <span class='card-underline'>through disruption</span>—<span class='card-underline'>has also become a source of regime power and popularity at home</span>. Russian nationalism features strongly in this story, with President Putin praising Russian culture as the last bulwark of conservative Christian values against the decadence of Europe and the tide of multiculturalism. Putin is personally popular, but approval ratings of 35 percent for the ruling party reflect public impatience with deteriorating quality of life conditions and abuse of power. Outlook: If the Kremlin’s tactics falter, Russia will become vulnerable to domestic instability driven by dissatisfied elites— even as a decline in status suggests more aggressive international action. Russia’s demographic picture has improved somewhat since the 1990s but remains bleak. Life expectancy among males is the lowest of the industrial world, and its population will continue to decline. The longer Moscow delays diversifying its economy, the more the government will stoke nationalism and sacrifice personal freedoms and pluralism to maintain control. An Increasingly Assertive China and Russia. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Beijing</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> and </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Moscow</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> will seek to lock in</span></span><span class='card-underline'> temporary </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>competitive advantages</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and to right what they charge are historical wrongs</span> before economic and demographic headwinds further slow their material progress and the West regains its footing. Both China and Russia maintain worldviews in which they are rightfully dominant in their regions and able to shape regional politics and economics to suit their security and material interests. <span class='card-underline'>Both have moved aggressively in recent years to </span><span class='card-underline'>exert greater influence</span><span class='card-underline'> in their regions, to contest the US geopolitically, and to force Washington to accept exclusionary regional spheres of influence</span>—a situation that the United States has historically opposed. For example, China views the continuing presence of the US Navy in the Western Pacific, the centrality of US alliances in the region, and US protection of Taiwan as outdated and representative of the continuation of China’s “100 years of humiliation.” Recent Sino-Russian cooperation has been tactical, however, and is likely to return to competition if Beijing jeopardizes Russian interests in Central Asia and as Beijing enjoys more options for cheap energy supply beyond Russia. Moreover, it is not clear whether there is a mutually acceptable border between what China and Russia consider their natural spheres of influence. Meanwhile, India’s growing economic power and profile in the region will further complicate these calculations, as New Delhi navigates relations with Beijing, Moscow, and Washington to protect its own expanding interests. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Russian assertiveness</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> will</span></span><span class='card-underline'> harden anti-Russian views in the Baltics and other parts of Europe, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>escalati</span></span><span class='card-underline'>ng</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> the risk of conflict</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> Russia will seek, and sometimes feign, international cooperation, while openly challenging norms and rules it perceives as counter to its interests and providing support for leaders of fellow “managed democracies” that encourage resistance to American policies and preferences. <span class='card-underline'>Moscow</span> has little stake in the rules of the global economy and <span class='card-underline'>can be counted on to take actions that weaken US and European institutional advantages.</span> <span class='card-underline'>Moscow will test </span><span class='card-underline'>NATO</span><span class='card-underline'> </span>and European <span class='card-underline'>resolve</span>, <span class='card-underline'>seeking to </span><span class='card-underline'>undermine Western credibility</span>; it will try to exploit splits between Europe’s north and south and east and west, and to drive a wedge between the United States and the EU. Similarly, Moscow will become more active in the Middle East and those parts of the world in which it believes it can check US influence. Finally, Russia will remain committed to nuclear weapons as a deterrent and as a counter to stronger conventional military forces, as well as its ticket to superpower status. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Russian military doctrine</span></span> purportedly <span class='card-underline'>includes the limited use of </span><span class='card-underline'>nuclear weapons</span> in a situation <span class='card-underline'>where Russia’s vital interests are at stake</span> <span class='card-underline'>to “deescalate” a conflict by demonstrating that continued conventional conflict </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>risks escalating</span></span><span class='card-underline'> the crisis </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>to a </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>large scale</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> nuclear exchange</span></span>.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>New impact: Resource Wars

They filed the majority of patents at technology companies such as Qualcomm (72%) and Cisco (60%), and more than 40% of US government-filed international patent applications had foreign authors4.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Then things changed. A backlog of applications built up for employment-based visas that allow permanent residency (green cards).</span> With sociologist Guillermina Jasso of New York University, we analysed this backlog. As of 1 October 2006, there were almost half a million applicants (more than one million when family members were included). Because only about 120,000 visas are available each year, <span class='card-underline'>getting a green card can take a decade</span>5. <span class='card-underline'>We forecast that this wait would increasingly frustrate highly skilled workers, leading to a 'reverse brain drain'.</span></p><p>Indeed, by 2012, my team found that immigrant entrepreneurship had stalled. The proportion of companies founded by immigrants fell nationwide to 24.3% and in Silicon Valley to 43.9% (ref. 6). We believe from anecdotal evidence that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>highly skilled workers are returning to their home countries in even larger numbers today</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>.</span></p><p><span class='card-underline'>These are the people who set up the unicorns in countries such as China and India. Each of those companies has one or more US returnees in senior leadership positions, and </span><span class='card-underline'>restrictive US immigration policies put them there</span><span class='card-underline'>.</span></p><p><span class='card-underline'>Two decades ago, it was the norm for students who came to the United States from China and India to want to stay. No longer.</span> On graduating from engineering courses, most overseas students say that they will work for a short time to gain experience, then return home7. Human-resource directors of companies in India and China tell me that they are flooded with CVs from students from US universities. <span class='card-underline'>Working for an exciting start-up such as Baidu or Alibaba is </span><span class='card-underline'>more enticing than being locked into a menial US position for a decade awaiting your green card</span><span class='card-underline'>.</span></p><p><span class='card-underline'>When I visit technology </span><span class='card-underline'>centres</span><span class='card-underline'> in China and India</span>, and increasingly in places such as Mexico City or Santiago in Chile, <span class='card-underline'>I see a beehive of start-up activity</span>. As well as social-media and Internet applications, <span class='card-underline'>overseas entrepreneurs are designing</span> wearable medical devices, <span class='card-underline'>robots, drone-based delivery systems, microsatellites and agricultural-automation systems</span>. They are building self-driving cars, solar technologies and 3D-printing systems to solve global problems.</p><p>Meanwhile, the US visa backlog is climbing. I estimate that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>there are more than 1.5 million skilled workers in immigration limbo in the</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>U</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>nited </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>S</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>tates </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>today</span></span>. Each one is a lost opportunity and a waste of talent.</p><p>Everyone loses. The precarious position of foreign-national staff leaves them open to mistreatment by their employers. Rules prevent employees from changing jobs while waiting for their green cards — even to other jobs in the same company. H-1B visas for temporary stays allow employers to replace US workers with people who are paid less than they should be, given their skills. This is one of Silicon Valley's darkest secrets — and it is why tech companies lobby for more H-1B visas rather than more green cards. Skilled people become frustrated as their careers stagnate. The jobs that would have been created in start-ups go overseas.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Unless it changes its immigration outlook, the</span> <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>U</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>nited </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>S</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>tates</span> will forgo economic benefits and jobs in a misguided effort to protect both. It <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>will have to watch as the rest of the world leaps ahead</span></span>. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>It</span></span><span class='card-underline'> doesn't have to be this way.</span></p><p>Embrace outsiders</p><p><span class='card-underline'>The</span> <span class='card-underline'>U</span>nited <span class='card-underline'>S</span>tates <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>needs to expand the number of permanent-resident visas and clear the backlog</span></span>. These people are already working in the country legally, and have the experience and skills needed. Retaining them will boost the economy. Accelerated granting of permanent residency could be contingent on buying a house, making investments or starting companies that create jobs. Imagine the benefits of 10,000 new technology start-ups.</p><p>We need to make it easy for entrepreneurs abroad to bring start-up firms to the United States. One solution is to provide a 'start-up visa' as a path to permanent residency. This would perhaps be valid for five years, with an upgrade to permanent residency dependent on the firm's employment of US workers. The Kauffman Foundation in Kansas City, Missouri, has estimated that such a visa would create 1.6 million jobs within 10 years and boost the US economy by $224 billion a year8.</p><p>The solution to the mistreatment of foreign workers is easy: untether the H-1B visa from the employer. Let people change jobs, and let the market decide what their salaries should be. This would remove the financial incentives for companies to replace Americans with cheaper foreign workers, and would encourage them to hire the best talent.</p><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>By becoming the best place in the world for entrepreneurs to study and work in, the</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>U</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>nited </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>S</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>tates </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>could again be in the driving seat of technology innovation. </span></span><span class='card-underline'>Then </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>we can share the resulting prosperity in a more equitable way to mitigate the anger of the electorate.</span></span> </p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'><span class='card-highlight'>Plan solves by allowing the U.S. to attract </span><span class='card-highlight'>sufficient number of</span><span class='card-highlight'> permanent skilled immigrants to meet technological needs</span></div><div class='cite'><span class='card-highlight'>Anderson, 5/21/</span>18 --- executive director of the National Foundation for American Policy, a non-partisan public policy research organization focusing on trade, immigration and related issues, former Executive Associate Commissioner for Policy and Planning and Counselor to the Commissioner at the Immigration and Naturalization Service (Stuart, “Will Congress Ever Solve The Long Wait For Green Cards?” https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2018/05/21/will-congress-ever-solve-the-long-wait-for-green-cards/#34b77973763c, accessed on 6/7/18, JMP)</div><div class='card-body'><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>If Congress fails to pass new legislation, some of the most highly skilled professionals in America will be </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>forced to leave the country or wait decades for employment-based green cards</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>.</span></span> How did America become mired in such a mess and what can be done to fix the problem?</p><p>The Origins of the Problem</p><p>Back in 1990, when the Immigration Act of 1990 was passed, Congress had a chance to secure America’s future as a magnet for top talent from all over the world. It failed in this mission.</p><p>First, Congress changed the existing H-1 temporary visa category to H-1B, added new requirements and set an annual limit of 65,000. Employers reached this limit within 6 years – and have also reached it every year for the past 16 fiscal years, encouraging companies to place more workers outside the U.S.</p><p>Second, Congress set an annual limit of 140,000 on employment-based green cards (for permanent residence). More than 20,000 of the green cards each year are devoted to immigrant investors, workers for jobs that don’t require a college degree, religious workers and others. More importantly, dependents (spouses and children) count against the 140,000 annual limit, accounting for about half of the total each year.</p><p>Third, the Immigration Act of 1990 unwisely retained per-country limits on employment-based immigrants. This continues to make no sense. It would be discrimination if a company said it will only hire a certain number of people of Chinese origin this year, yet collectively U.S. employers are only allowed to gain permanent residence for a limited number of people from any one country. Companies should not care where a person was born and neither should Congress.</p><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Due to the combination of the per-country limit and 140,000 employment-based green card allotment, </span></span><span class='card-underline'>the National Foundation for American Policy estimates </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>an Indian-born professional in the third preference</span></span> (EB-3) <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>can </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>wait 10 to 25 years or longer for an employment-based green card</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>.</span></span> I have met dozens of individuals who have already waited more than 10 years for a green card.</p><p>Congress Misses the Technological Revolution</p><p><span class='card-underline'>A </span><span class='card-underline'>key reason members of Congress</span><span class='card-underline'> failed in setting workable employment-based immigration limits in 1990 is they lacked</span> imagination – or <span class='card-underline'>any sense of our technological future</span>. In short, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>new technologies created a demand for people with technical skills well beyond the annual </span></span><span class='card-underline'>limits on H-1B visas and employment-based green cards established in the Immigration Act</span> of 1990.</p><p>Back in 1990, <span class='card-underline'>the World Wide Web did not exist on a global basis for individuals and nobody knew that e-commerce would become a key aspect of economic life for many consumers</span>. Streaming video? Streaming music? Social media? Online multiplayer video games? Those who set our immigration limits could not have anticipated any of these developments. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Establishing flexible or market-based limits, instead of fixing in place rigid caps, would have made a great difference.</span></span></p><p>Consumer devices, most notably the smartphone, have spawned new industries. Just like Netflix couldn’t have sent bulky videotapes through the mail before the invention of DVDs, Uber and Lyft could not exist without smartphones.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>New advances continue to fuel the demand for skilled labor in the U.S. And this comes at a time when </span><span class='card-underline'>only about 20% of the full-time graduate students at U.S. universities in computer science and electrical engineering are U.S. citizens</span> (or permanent residents). <span class='card-underline'>“Emerging technologies, such as driverless</span><span class='card-underline'> vehicles, may also be increasing the demand for people with high levels of technical skill, including foreign-born researchers,” noted a recent National Foundation for American Policy report</span>. “Tesla (207 approved new H-1B petitions in FY 2017), Uber (158) and General Motors (179) all employ individuals in H-1B status.”</p><p>The Solution</p><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>This is</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>actually </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>an</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> easy problem to fix. Congress needs to</span></span> take three steps. First, to <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>alleviate the burden on those waiting the longest</span></span>, Congress could pass H.R. 392. With 323 cosponsors, the bill has achieved a level of bipartisan support unheard of in this age of polarization.</p><p>“Due to an arbitrary per-country cap in the employment-based green card laws, immigrants who come here legally on work visas from India or China face a massive backlog for obtaining their permanent residence,” H.R. 392’s chief sponsor, Rep. Kevin Yoder (R-KS), told me in an interview. “If you do some simple math, you’ll realize many of these individuals will go their entire lives without ever getting their green card. Whereas, there are individuals who come here from other smaller nations that can get one in a matter of two to three years.”</p><p>Yoder’s bill would <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>transition to an immigration system that operates without per-country limits in the employment categories</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>. </span><span class='card-underline'>That would dramatically reduce the wait times for those who have already been waiting a decade or more and allow all new entrants to gain permanent residence in a more reasonable time frame.</span></p><p><span class='card-underline'>Second, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Congress should raise the annual limit well above the 140,000 now permitted each year for employment-based immigrants.</span></span></p><p><span class='card-underline'>Third, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Congress should exempt the dependents of sponsored immigrants from the numerical limit, as well individuals with graduate degrees in science and engineering fields.</span></span></p><p>For those who worry this will lead to fewer jobs for U.S. workers, well, stop worrying. “The results of the state-level analysis indicate that immigration does not increase U.S. natives’ unemployment or reduce their labor force participation,” according to a study for the National Foundation for American Policy by economist Madeline Zavodny. “Instead, having more immigrants reduces the unemployment rate and raises the labor force participation rate of U.S. natives within the same sex and education group.”</p><p>The Benefits of Solving the Problem</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Enacting these reforms is a humane solution that will benefit America economically. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>If U.S. companies can retain and attract top </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>talent</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> they will better compete in global markets and create more jobs in America</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> A solution would also help people like Sunayana Dumala.</p><p>In February 2017, a racist gunman yelled, “Get out of my country” and shot Srinivas Kuchibhotla and another H-1B visa holder (Alok Madasani) at Austins Bar & Grille in Olathe, Kansas. (Ian Grillot was shot trying to disarm the shooter.) Srinivas Kuchibhotla’s employer applied for his green card in 2010. Because of the per-country limit and numerical restrictions in the employment-based category, the long wait meant Srinivas died before his application was approved. Without permanent residence, his widow, Sunayana Dumala, has no legal right to live permanently in the United States. Rep. Yoder has worked to help Sunayana stay in the U.S., while also seeking a long-term solution to the green card problem for high-skilled immigrants.</p><p>Jyoti Bansal has lived the kind of American Dream success story everyone can embrace – but it almost didn’t happened. “I waited 7 years for my employment-based green card and I wanted to leave my job and start a new company but couldn’t,” Jyoti told me in an interview. <span class='card-underline'>“What is most frustrating about the green card process is you have no control over a major part of your life. I have friends who </span><span class='card-underline'>became frustrated with the uncertainty and after years of waiting they finally left the</span> <span class='card-underline'>U</span>nited <span class='card-underline'>S</span>tates.”</p><p>Finally, in 2007, Jyoti received an employment authorization document (EAD) as part of the green card process. He left his employer and started AppDynamics. The company, which provides the equivalent of a 24 hour/7 days a week MRI for a customer’s website, with clients such as HBO, grew to over 900 people and a lofty valuation of $1.9 billion. That valuation was shattered in January 2017, just before an initial public offering, when Cisco acquired AppDynamics for $3.7 billion.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Jyoti Bansal has moved on to new ventures. But his company that employs over 900 workers and is worth nearly $4 billion almost never got off the ground because of a flawed immigration law.

Once aroused that anxiety seeks a political home.

Others noted this contradiction and chastised the United States for it. One thoughtful and well-argued study in the 1990s asserted that <span class='card-underline'>nuclear weapons should never be used against biological</span> (or chemical) <span class='card-underline'>threats or in retaliation</span> for such attacks. In considering the possibility of an extremely destructive biological agent that killed as many as nuclear weapons might, the authors wrote that “… it would be technically and operationally difficult to achieve such high numbers of casualties with biological weapons, and no nation is known to possess weapons so effective.”107 It is a good reason that, as a normal matter of policy, <span class='card-underline'>the United States should not plan on </span><span class='card-underline'>any nuclear response to attacks by lesser types of weapons of mass destruction</span>, especially the types of attacks that might be anticipated today or that have been witnessed in the recent past (for example, the chemical attacks during the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s).108 From this standpoint, the Nuclear Posture Review reached a sound conclusion on responding to a BW or CW attack.</p><p>But this argument is perhaps more persuasive for the technologies of the present rather than a hypothetical situation in the future; things could change over time. That is the crux of the challenge for future policy and doctrine regarding whether nuclear weapons should have a future purpose of helping deter advanced biological attack.</p><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Biological weapons could become much more potent in coming decades</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Biological knowledge certainly is advancing rapidly</span></span>. To take one metric, the number of genetic sequences on file, a measure of knowledge of genetic codes for various organisms, grew from well under five million in the early 1990s to 80 million by 2006.109 The number of countries involved in biological research is growing rapidly as well. What about 25 to 50 years from now, a day that current policymakers must contemplate when considering lasting changes to doctrine as well as the pursuit of a nuclear-weapons-free world?</p><p>As of 2008, more than 160 states had ratified and acceded to the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, but one of its weaknesses is the lack of verification measures. One can naturally hope that better monitoring and verification concepts will be developed in the biological field—just as they must clearly be improved in the nuclear realm if abolition is ever to be feasible even on its own more narrow terms.110 But these techniques will be very hard to devise, and probably rather imperfect in their ability to provide timely warning. One can try various forms of direct as well as indirect monitoring—the latter including looking for mismatches between the numbers of trained scientists and professional positions available to them in a given country, or a mismatch between the numbers of relevant scientists and associated publications.111 Big disparities could suggest hidden programs. One can also build up disease surveillance systems and create rapid-response BW investigation teams to look into any suspected development of illicit pathogens or any outbreak of associated disease.112 But the United States will still need a good deal of luck to discover many hypothetical biological weapons programs. Any countries bent on cheating will have a good chance of success in hiding their associated research and production facilities.</p><p>For Americans, who long led the way in biology, it is sobering and important to remember that even today, at least half of all important biological research is already done abroad. It often takes place in small facilities that are very hard if not impossible to identify from remote sensing.113</p><p>For such reasons, it is eminently possible that an advanced “bug”—perhaps an influenza-born derivative of smallpox resilient against currently available treatments, for example—could be developed by a future aggressor state. Such a bug could combine the contagious qualities of the flu with the lethality of very severe diseases.114 This could dramatically alter the calculations of BW use.</p><p>It is such a prospect that led University of Maryland scholar John Steinbruner to note “One can imagine killing more people with an advanced pathogen than with the current nuclear weapons arsenals.”115 The state developing this BW agent might simultaneously develop a vaccine against the new disease and use that vaccine to inoculate its own people. It might then use the biological pathogen as a weapon, or a threat, against another country. That could be a country it was interested in conquering; it could also threaten use against the United States and broader international community, to deter other countries from coming to the rescue of another state being attacked directly by the aggressor (analogous to how Saddam Hussein would have liked to deter the U.S.-led coalition from coming to Kuwait’s aid in 1990-1991). <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>If the United States faced the prospect of millions of its own citizens, or hundreds of thousands of its own troops, becoming sick</span></span> as it considered a response to aggression, and its only recourse was conventional retaliation, <span class='card-underline'>its range of options could be limited</span>. Indeed, <span class='card-underline'>the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>very troops called on to carry out the retaliation might become vulnerable to the disease, jeopardizing their physical capacity</span></span> to execute the conventional operation. Perhaps they could be wellprotected on the battlefield, once suited up, but they could be vulnerable before deployment, along with the rest of the American population. A potential adversary, seeing these possibilities, might find the concept of such an advanced pathogen very appealing.</p><p>Would there be a clear and definitive policy or moral argument against the use of a nuclear weapon in retaliation for a BW attack that killed hundreds of thousands—or even millions—of Americans? If the origin of the attack could be identified, as it might well be under numerous scenarios like the one sketched above, and if huge numbers of American civilians had been targeted, <span class='card-underline'>the case for restraint would be hard to make</span>. At the least, it might be no stronger than the case for absorbing a nuclear weapons strike and choosing not to retaliate.</p><p>What if the United States thought a biological attack by an aggressor imminent? Or what <span class='card-underline'>if it had already suffered one attack and others seemed possible</span>? In such circumstances, <span class='card-underline'>there could be </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>potential value in a nuclear retaliatory threat against the belligerent state</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>warning that any future use of biological attacks against the American people or U.S. allies might produce a nuclear response</span></span>.116</p><p>In his classic book on just and unjust war, Michael Walzer asserted that “Nuclear war is and will remain morally unacceptable, and there is no case for its rehabilitation.” He also argues “Nuclear weapons explode the theory of just war. They are the first of mankind’s technological innovations that are simply not encompassable within the familiar moral world.” This would seem to argue (since biological weapons of certain types predated nuclear technologies) that in fact nuclear deterrent threats could never be justifiable against a biological attack. However, the logic of Walzer’s overall case against nuclear weapons is based explicitly on their indiscriminate and extreme effects—characteristics that advanced biological pathogens, which did not exist when he wrote the above words, would share. It is hard to argue that nuclear deterrence of an adversary’s possible use of an advanced pathogen that could kill a million or even ten million is less justifiable than the use of nuclear deterrence against an adversary’s nuclear arms.117</p><p>Indeed, it is possible that a nuclear response to such a biological attack might be conducted in a more humane way than the BW attack. Nuclear responses might target military bases and command headquarters, for example. To be sure, civilians would also be at risk in such a nuclear attack, but in proportionate terms a nuclear retaliatory blow could well cause a smaller fraction of casualties among innocent civilian populations than would a biological pathogen.118</p><p>U.S. policymakers had to bear in mind what is possible, at least theoretically, with advanced engineered pathogens. As Steinbruner notes, in discussing the contagiousness of certain flu-borne ailments,</p><p>“One strain infected an estimated 80 percent of the world’s population in a sixmonth period. Normally the incidence of disease among those infected is relatively low, as is the mortality rate of those who contract the disease. However, aviary strains of the virus have killed virtually all of the birds infected, which suggests the possibility of highly lethal human strains as well.”119</p><p>It was <span class='card-underline'>these kinds of considerations</span> that <span class='card-underline'>led the Nuclear Posture Review to incorporate a hedge with regard to biological weapons</span>. While U.S. policy now is not to respond with nuclear weapons for a CW or BW attack by a non-nuclear weapons state, <span class='card-underline'>the U.S. government retained the option to reconsider nuclear retaliation with regard to BW</span> if there were major advances in biotechnology that were put to use for BW purposes.</p><p>But the other side of the argument is not inconsequential, either. Advanced biological pathogens may never be developed; nuclear weapons already have been not only developed but mass-produced and used. Retaining the threat of nuclear retaliation based on hypothetical concerns about possible future developments with biological agents that are far from inevitable may be unnecessary and unjustified. Surely it would be seen as cynical in the eyes of some, as a barely veiled attempt to find an excuse to maintain dependence on nuclear arms, and could undercut the value of the policy change in reducing the relevance of nuclear weapons. </p><p>Moreover, <span class='card-underline'>if a biological weapon with mass casualty features ever were developed</span> and utilized to devastating effect, <span class='card-underline'>the United States would not be constrained in its retaliatory options in any event</span><span class='card-highlight'>. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>If a million Americans</span></span>, Germans, Italians or Japanese <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>were killed</span></span> by a superbug, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>it would be hard to imagine a particularly strong international criticism if Washington reversed its previous pledges and responded with nuclear arms</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>.</span> If necessary, <span class='card-underline'>this point could be conveyed privately through diplomatic channels</span> to U.S. allies in advance, as a way of shoring up the credibility of the American extended deterrent even as the formal role of nuclear weapons was publicly constrained by announcement of a new doctrine. This could offer a way to avoid allowing the unlikely and extreme scenario of horrific biological attack to stand in the way of the more immediate agenda of reducing the role of nuclear weapons in U.S. security policy.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'><span class='card-highlight'>Brain </span><span class='card-highlight'>drain low now- immigrants worldwide are returning home</span></div><div class='cite'><span class='card-highlight'>Hirsch 12</span> (Michelle, “US Educated Immigrants Returning to Their Homelands”).

With the U.S. facing a shortage of skilled workers, the wave of immigrants who are turning their backs on America is foreboding. A growing population of highly-educated Americans and foreign nationals educated in the states are less committed to living and working in the U.S., preferring to return to their homelands, many of which are emerging economies. “It’s only really come to light in the last year or two, but <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>we’re noticing a pattern of highly-skilled children of foreign-born U.S. immigrants leaving the U.S. for the countries where their parents were born</span></span>,” said Madeleine Sumption, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. Sumption says the trend is strong in China, India and Brazil where dramatic economic growth over the last decade has opened up opportunities for entrepreneurship and led U.S. multinationals to hire overseas employees with western educations. “We’re putting together a picture of what’s happening partly from data and partly from anecdotal evidence since it’s a relatively new phenomenon.” Entrepreneurship experts say <span class='card-underline'>a combination of booming developing economies, a still-soft U.S. economy, and difficulty obtaining green cards is driving foreign-born U.S. students who in past years would have remained in the U.S. on temporary visas to move home. “Some of the sheen has come off the U.S. economy as the place to make your fortune—especially if you’re from another country and have a U.S. education</span>,” said Robert Litan, vice president of research and policy at the Kauffman Foundation. “They know all the hot things that are going in the United States, and see a real opportunity to replicate them or do something similar in their home country that doesn’t have it.” According to data from the Brazilian government, U.S. applications for permanent work visas in Brazil rose 77 percent between 2008 and 2011, and temporary visas rose 36 percent during that time. <span class='card-underline'>China and India</span> have not released those same statistics, though other <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>data</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>point to growing numbers of American-educated individuals choosing to move to </span></span><span class='card-underline'>those countries [</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>China and India</span></span><span class='card-underline'>]. </span>The Chinese Ministry of Education estimates that the number of Chinese living overseas who returned to China more-than tripled between 2007 and 2010 from 44,000 to 135,000. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Government officials in India say they’ve seen a steep rise in the number of people of Indian ancestry entering the country over the past several years</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> At least 100,000 Indians, including students returned in 2010, according to Alwyn Didar Singh, a former Secretary at the Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs. “If one were to estimate, a majority of the professionals returning, as also students, would be from the US,” he told The Fiscal Times. Litan says if the U.S. economy were growing at a 4 percent rate rather than the current rate of about 2 percent, the number of voluntary departures would likely decline. In contrast, India and China’s economies are expanding at around 7 percent. The challenge for the U.S. is how to keep educated foreign students in the U.S. That would require overhauling immigration policies. Currently, if a foreign student wants to remain in the U.S. after graduation, he or she must be sponsored by an employer and apply for an H1B Visa. Those visas, which expire after six years, preclude foreigners from starting their own companies. To stay here, the worker must apply for a green card, which also requires sponsorship The U.S. government caps the number of green cards available each year at 140,000, with every country limited to no more than 9,800.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'><span class='card-highlight'>The plan will make immigrants go to the United States</span><span class='card-highlight'> – cross-apply their own evidence</span></div><div class='cite'><span class='card-highlight'>Raveesh 13</span> <span class='card-highlight'>(</span> S., “Brain Drain: Socio-Economic Impact on Indian Society”).

India spends only 0.9 percent of its GDP on healthcare, which promotes a large private healthcare industry that remains inaccessible to the poor. The wealthy can afford to be treated at a state-of-the-art hospital for a stomach ache, while the poor must walk long miles to receive treatment for sicknesses and sometimes discover that the medicine they need is unavailable. The shortage of doctors is staggering: there are only six doctors for every 10,000 patients. People in need of medical attention may spend days waiting in line for tests or drugs because there are simply not enough doctors and nurses available to tend to their medical needs. India is not the only country that suffers from brain drain, and the loss of human capital does not only affect the medical industry. Zimbabwe is struggling to keep its education sector from collapsing after losing 45,000 teachers in 2010 alone. Haiti has lost more college graduates than any other country in the world. Brain drain is occurring in every region of the developing world. Plugging the Drain Ensuring that skilled workers have opportunities to flourish at home is ultimately a challenge for source countries, not the richer countries that absorb them when they leave.

Perhaps developed countries can provide some assistance through educational partnerships or other forms of cooperation. But because freedom of movement is an inalienable human right, neither the United States nor the source countries can (or should) simply prohibit skilled workers from moving around the globe.

But how great is this loss? If these people are still making contributions to China, their families, and their home units, China may benefit from "storing brainpower overseas.'"* The following section will assess the extent of the loss, as well as the potential benefits to China of having so many talented Chinese abroad. One measure of the loss caused by the brain drain is the investment China has made in these non-returnees. Is China losing highly qualified people in whom the state had already made a major investment, or are many of the people going to the United States actually gaining much of their training overseas? According to Chang, despite the fact that the return rate of Taiwanese students studying in the United States has been only 18 percent, the loss is not so great because the vast majority of these people were trained in the United States and therefore reflect a "migration and education" pattern, rather than an exodus of high-class scientists and engineers.^ One can compare this to India, where a highly developed education system trains many Ph.D.s who are educated at home and then migrate to the developed world. In this case, the loss is much greater. <span class='card-underline'>To assess this factor we looked at our interviewees' edu cational levels when they left China. Our findings suggest that there is significant loss, but not as much as that suffered by Third World coun tries that lose fully trained faculty members, mostly because </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>China to date has not produced many Ph.D.s</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> In our sample, only 9 people (3.3 percent) had already attained the Ph.D. before leaving China; the major ity had completed their undergraduate training (49.1 percent) or had received an M.A. in China (44.6 percent) and had left China to get a Ph.D.^ This situation reflects the "migration and education" pattern in Taiwan's and South Korea's brain drain, where students went to the United States to earn the Ph.D. but did not return. From this perspec tive, despite the fact that China does not produce a large <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>number of undergraduate students and that the cost of training them is borne by the state, losing people with only a B.A. is more a loss of potential brain power than a loss of already trained talent</span></span>. On the other hand, if our sample is even somewhat representative of the Chinese student population in the United States, then tens of thousands of very valuable M.A. students have been leaving China and not returning. <span class='card-underline'>For a society producing a limited number of Ph.D.s, the master's degree is quite important, as many of these people become university lecturers and form the key source of the future generation of Chinese scientists and researchers.^ Moreover, as 45 percent of our sample (124) came to the United States to get Ph.D.s, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the loss of potential brainpower is significant, especially if many of them do get this advanced degree and do not return to China.</span></span></p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'><span class='card-highlight'>Brain Drain hurts the Indian Economy</span></div><div class='cite'>Kariyatil <span class='card-highlight'>Krishnadas 1</span>,( Kariyatil Krishnadas is editor of TechIndia, “Brain drain hurts developing nations, U.N. reports”, http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1143665&)//SD</div><div class='card-body'><p>BANGALORE, India — <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The exodus of Indian engineers mostly to the United States costs India $2 billion annually, according to a recent U.N. study.</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>While the United Nations Human Development Report 2001 stresses that "<span class='card-underline'>technology itself has become a source of economic growth" for countries like India, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>many</span></span><span class='card-underline'> of the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>benefits are being outweighed by the brain drain of engineering talent. </span></span><span class='card-highlight'>"</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Rich nations have been opening their doors to developing-country professionals at a high cost to the home countries,"</span></span> the U.N. study warned.

King tweeted that if reports of the president’s dealings are correct, “Trump base is blown up, destroyed, irreparable, and disillusioned beyond repair. No promise is credible.” But the president expressed confidence Republicans would stick with him even if he helps DACA recipients, telling reporters Thursday many are “very, very happy with what we’re doing.” The former campaign adviser endorsed Trump’s view, saying his support is “not tied to a specific policy, it’s tied to disrupting, it’s tied to shaking up the status quo.” “That’s what the base likes, bringing disruption to a city that has been mired in gridlock,” the aide said. On Friday, Trump tacitly acknowledged his newfound love for bipartisanship carries political risk. The president rallied supporters with a string of tough-talking early morning tweets on the terror attack at London subway station and an ESPN host who called him a white supremacist. He also reassured his backers that “CHAIN MIGRATION cannot be allowed to be part of any legislation on Immigration!” The term refers to the practice of immigrants with legal status sponsoring certain family members so that they can come to the U.S. Yet some of Trump’s allies continue to question why he seems to be prioritizing a top issue for Democrats, the status of immigrants in the U.S. illegally, over his campaign promise to build a border wall. By not demanding wall funding be attached to a DACA bill, Trump supporters say he is giving away his most valuable bargaining chip in exchange for vague promises of stronger border security from Schumer and Pelosi. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Trump</span></span><span class='card-underline'> once </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>bragged that his supporters are</span></span><span class='card-underline'> so </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>loyal</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, he could shoot someone in the street and he would not lose support</span>.

The former campaign aide said Trump’s supporters wouldn’t have a better option in 2020, regardless of what he does on immigration. “It’s not 2016 Trump against 2020 Trump,” the aide said. “It’s Trump running against [Sens.] Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders, and it’s not like these voters would run to vote for the other side.” In the short term, conservatives' anger at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has provided a buffer for Trump against the backlash from his base. Frustration with the GOP leaders gave Trump room to break with them and strike an agreement with Democrats on a deal to extend the nation’s borrowing limit and fund the government. That dynamic could persist until Republicans begin notching legislative victories of their own. “He has such a diverse coalition and his base elected him knowing that he isn’t overly ideological,” said a GOP consultant who requested anonymity. “Poll after poll shows that Republicans will blame Ryan and McConnell every single time, so he has leeway here.” But the consultant warned <span class='card-underline'>that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>cover might not last</span></span><span class='card-underline'> forever, because “it’s never a good sign to have key influencers turn their backs</span>.” Key figures on the right warn that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>immigration is a different animal from other policy</span></span><span class='card-underline'> areas. </span>Trump’s tough talk on the issue was a major reason why the right rallied behind him in 2016 over GOP establishment figures like former Florida Gov.

Asked his opinion of the executive order Trump signed Friday afternoon, the physics major said he doesn’t believe every Muslim is a terrorist but that the vetting system needs to be improved before any more people from Middle Eastern countries are allowed into the U.S. “Imagine Syria. There are very few records on some of the people because it’s a war zone.” Altavilla voted for Trump in November, just like almost 60 percent of voters in Luzerne County, which flipped from supporting Obama by 5 points in 2012 to a 20-point victory for Trump. A third-generation Italian-American, Altavilla tells Newsweek that he thinks Trump should have presented the executive order as a “hold” instead of a “ban,” but that he agrees with Trump’s order. “I’m not sure if his handling was correct, but <span class='card-underline'>what he did was correct</span>.” <span class='card-underline'>Most </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Trump voters</span></span> from this mountainous county, a two-hour drive west of New York City, <span class='card-underline'>were quick to voice their </span><span class='card-underline'>support</span> <span class='card-underline'>for the executive order that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>block</span></span><span class='card-underline'>s citizens of </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>seven mostly-Muslim countries from coming to the U.S. for at least three months, </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>bans all refugees</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> for four months and bars Syrian refugees indefinitely</span></span>. <span class='card-underline'>They saw the ban as a smart way to protect the country from terrorist attacks</span><span class='card-underline'>, and they dismissed arguments that the order amounted to a religious ban or comparisons between the order and America’s rejection of Jews fleeing Nazi Germany. </span>“I don’t think he’s picked out a religion, he’s picked out countries that need more vetting,” retired Army lieutenant colonel Stephen Urban, a Democrat who supported Bernie Sanders in the primary and Trump in the general, tells Newsweek. Urban thinks it’s important to view the immigration order in the context of Trump’s recent directive to hire 5,000 more Border Patrol agents. “<span class='card-underline'>I support his policy 100 percent</span>,” Urban says. “He just wants to have [agents] in place to process people and make sure they’re vetted.” <span class='card-underline'>Even a Trump</span> <span class='card-underline'>voter whose father immigrated from the Middle East called the motive behind the order “understandable” and says it doesn’t lessen his support for Trump,</span> though he does think it incorrectly paints too many people as potential enemies. “I don’t agree with it, but I’m not on the protest bandwagon,” says Mark Rabo, 40, a heavy equipment operator in Luzerne County whose father was an immigrant from Jordan. (His mom immigrated from what is now the Czech Republic and voted for Hillary Clinton in November.) “What needs to happen is there needs to be legislation to screen out and vet people who are on a watchlist or part of a known terrorist group.”</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'><span class='card-highlight'>The base hates legal immigration for people who aren’t white and Christian</span></div><div class='cite'><span class='card-highlight'>Beinart 18</span> (2/18, Peter, associate professor of journalism and political science at the City University of New York & Atlantic editor, “It's Not Illegal Immigration That Worries Republicans Anymore”, The Atlantic, https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/02/what-the-new-gop-crack-down-on-legal-immigration-reveals/553631/)</div><div class='card-body'><p>What explains this? <span class='card-underline'>Trump’s great hidden advantage during the 2016 Republican presidential primary was his lack of support from the GOP political and donor class. This allowed him to jettison positions</span>—in support of free trade, in support of the Iraq War, in support of cutting Medicare and Social Security—<span class='card-underline'>that enjoyed support among Republican elites but little support among Republican voters. He did the same on immigration, where the “legal good, illegal bad” distinction turned out to be much more popular among the party’s leaders than among its grassroots</span>. Cribbing from Ann Coulter’s book, Adios America, <span class='card-underline'>Trump replaced the legal-illegal distinction with one that turned out to have more resonance on the activist right: </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The distinction between white Christian immigrants and non-white, and non-Christian ones</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. </span>The words “illegal immigration” do not appear in Trump’s presidential announcement speech. Instead, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Trump focused on immigrants’ country of origin</span></span>. “<span class='card-underline'>When </span><span class='card-underline'>Mexico</span><span class='card-underline'> sends its people</span>,” he declared, “<span class='card-underline'>they’re not sending their best … They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime</span>. They’re rapists … It’s coming from more than Mexico. <span class='card-underline'>It’s coming from all over </span><span class='card-underline'>South and Latin America</span><span class='card-underline'>, and it’s coming</span> probably—probably—<span class='card-underline'>from </span><span class='card-underline'>the Middle East</span>.” <span class='card-underline'>Trump, who often says bluntly what other Republicans say in code, probably realized that “illegal immigrant” was, for many voters, already a euphemism for Latino or Mexican-immigrants</span>. In their book White Backlash, the political scientists Marisa Abrajano and Zoltan Hajnal cite a poll showing that 61 percent of Americans believe that most Latino immigrants are undocumented even though only about a quarter are. “<span class='card-underline'>When Americans talk about undocumented immigrants, Latinos or immigrants in general,” they note, “the images in their heads are likely to be the same.” What really drove </span><span class='card-underline'>Republican opinion about immigration</span>, Trump realized, <span class='card-underline'>was not </span>primarily <span class='card-underline'>the fear that the United States was becoming a country of law-breakers</span>. (Republicans, after all, were not outraged about the lack of prosecution of tax cheats<span class='card-underline'>.) </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>It was the fear that the United States</span></span>—which <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>was becoming less white</span></span> <span class='card-underline'>and</span> had just elected a president of Kenyan descent—<span class='card-underline'>was becoming a third-world country</span>. When the Public Religion Research Institute and Brookings Institution asked Americans in 2016 their views of immigration from different parts of the world, it found that <span class='card-underline'>Republicans</span> were only three points more likely than Democrats to want to reduce immigration from “predominantly Christian countries” and only seven points more likely to want to reduce immigration from Europe. By contrast, they were <span class='card-underline'>33 points more likely to support reducing immigration from Mexico and Central America and 41 points more likely to support reducing immigration from “predominantly Muslim countries</span>.” <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>What really drives Republican views about immigrants</span></span>, in other words, <span class='card-underline'>is less their legal status than their </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>nation of origin, their religion, and their race</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. Trump grasped that during the campaign, and in coalition with a bevy of current and former</span> Southern <span class='card-underline'>Senators</span>—Jeff Sessions, David Perdue and Tom Cotton—<span class='card-underline'>he has used it to turn the GOP into a party devoted to slashing legal immigration</span>. On Thursday, when presented with a bill that traded the legalization of Dreamers for more border security but did not reduce legal immigration, only eight Republican Senators voted yes.

After President Donald Trump was sworn in, he rolled out more policies against globalization and focused on America’s interest.The US President believes immigrants are a key reason for terrorism that threatens the US homeland security and also for the unemployment problem. On January 27th, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order titled “Protecting the Nation from foreign terrorists entry into the United States” (the socalled “Muslim ban”). The measure prohibited for a period of three months the entry into the US of citizens from seven countries. The ban halted the Refugees Admission Program for 120 days, and suspended indefinitely the reestablishment in the USA of a Syrian refugee program launched by the Obama administration. Besides, the US media revealed that Trump government also intended to issue a decree to cancel the H1-B Visa Lottery system that prioritizes foreign students graduating from the US higher education institutions. The Draft Decree also was reported to revoke the Obama administration’s policy to extend from 12 to 36 months the STEM OPT (Optional Practical Training for students with Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics degrees). These new immigration policy measures encountered strong opposition both at home and abroad, especially the science and technology community. Even though the American Federal Judiciary has blocked the “Muslim ban”, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Trump’s attitude against globalization leads us to believe that the restrictions on immigrants might still be enacted</span></span> one day in the future. </p><p>On the contrary, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>China is</span></span><span class='card-underline'> currently </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>reforming the immigration policies with an aim to establish a</span></span><span class='card-underline'> more</span> open and <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>flexible system to attract international talent</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>s</span>. In December, 2012, the Organization Department of the Central Committee of CPC, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and other 25 government agencies jointly issued the “Administrative Measures on Entitlement of Foreigners with Chinese Permanent Residence”. In June, 2015, the Ministry of Public Security expanded the fields in which foreigners who apply for a Chinese Permanent Residence (Chinese Green Card) can work, based on the regulations of the “Measures for the Administration of Examination and Approval of Foreigners’ Permanent Residence in China”. Since then, Beijing, Shanghai, Fujian, and Guangdong, among other places, adopted new policy measures for the issuance of visa and residence permits to foreigners, to build a more open and flexible environment for them to live and work in China. In March, 2016, Zhongguancun became the first area to pilot the 20 new entry and exit policies for foreigners adopted by the Ministry of Public Security to support mass innovation in Beijing. These measures are expected to make it easier for foreign talent to enter and exit China to start their own business.</p><p>On Feb. 6th, 2017, the central government made a step forward in the immigration policy reforms and required the effort to improve the permanent residence permit system, as it is required by the national talent development strategy. </p><p>The recent <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>US policies</span></span><span class='card-underline'> that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>impose more restrictions on immigration is closing the door to</span></span> many <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>international talent</span></span>.

Its growing countries are demanding more energy as well as energy-intensive products</span> such as iron, steel, cement, electric appliances and cars. They are also increasingly looking to adopt clean energy. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>This</span></span><span class='card-underline'> fast-growing energy consumption </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>requires </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>more reliable and efficient infrastructure and markets</span></span>. To meet the rapidly rising demand that comes with the region's economic development and is fuelling it, Asia's investment in the oil, gas and power sectors could be as high as US$10 trillion over the next 20 years, according to the International Energy Agency. <span class='card-underline'>Through</span> the "<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>One Belt, One Road</span></span>" initiative, <span class='card-underline'>China will help to offset some of these major challenges</span>. <span class='card-underline'>It </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>will invest in energy projects ranging from</span></span><span class='card-underline'> upstream projects, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>oil and gas</span></span><span class='card-underline'> pipelines, and liquefied natural gas terminals </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>to</span></span><span class='card-underline'> high-voltage </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>power lines</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, nuclear power </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>and renewable energy</span></span>. It will create a more efficient and better integrated energy network. In terms of energy project investment, the natural gas sector is already feeling the impact of the "One Belt, One Road" initiative. As demand increases across Asia for natural gas as a cleaner substitute for coal and oil, it is driving Qatar, Iran, Indonesia and Australia to raise their output. China and Russia have already signed a long-term natural gas contract and there is the possibility that North America will sell natural gas to East Asia in the future. As such, a hub and proper pricing system is necessary to facilitate the fast-growing market for natural gas in the region. Some of China's harbour cities such as Shanghai and Tangshan , in Hebei , have put forward the idea of developing a natural gas hub.

The stakes are high. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>China should pay</span></span> close attention to the risks posed by water conflicts to <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>its Silk Road Economic Belt</span></span>. China needs to lead by example by successfully managing the Ili and Irtysh rivers with Kazakhstan. Encouragingly, compared with its water policies on other major transboundary rivers, China has a relatively high level of institutionalised cooperation with Kazakhstan. For instance, the two countries signed an agreement on the common use and protection of transboundary rivers in 2001. And they launched the China–Kazakhstan Friendship Joint Water Diversion Project on the Khorgos River in April 2011. <span class='card-underline'>China can take the lead in mediating water disputes among Central Asian countries</span>. As a first step towards this aim, China needs to expedite the conclusion of a comprehensive Agreement on Water Distribution of Cross-Border Rivers. More importantly, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>China could help facilitate</span></span><span class='card-underline'> the adoption of </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the ‘nexus approach</span></span><span class='card-underline'>’ to managing water conflicts</span> in Central Asia. <span class='card-underline'>The </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>nexus approach recognises that water, energy and food systems are inseparable</span></span>. Food production accounts for 70 per cent of total global freshwater withdrawals, making it the largest user of water. Water is also needed to produce, transport or use all forms of energy. Meanwhile, the food production and supply chain consumes about 30 per cent of total global energy. And energy is needed to produce, transport and distribute food as well as to extract and treat water. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Efforts in</span></span><span class='card-underline'> the food and </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>energy production systems could therefore help to alleviate water stress in Central Asia</span></span>. While agriculture consumes 70 per cent of the fresh water usage in Central Asia, 50–80 per cent of that is wasted due to faulty irrigation systems. Agricultural modernisation will help to keep regional water conflicts under control. China has much to offer on this front. First, with ample foreign reserves, China could invest in Central Asia’s backward agricultural infrastructure, particularly in modernising its irrigation systems. Second, water-saving technologies and drought-resistant seeds from China could further reduce water demand in Central Asia’s agricultural sector. Third, by promoting interregional and intraregional agricultural trade across Central Asia, China could help facilitate the development of a better cropping structure. For instance, by importing water-intensive crops such as rice and wheat, Uzbekistan could allocate more of its arable land to the production of drought-resistant crops like potatoes. Finally, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>rebuilding the</span></span><span class='card-underline'> regional </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>energy market</span></span><span class='card-underline'> in Central Asia </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>could help to normalise water ties between</span></span><span class='card-underline'> the downstream and upstream </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>countries</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>.</span> With some 300 days of sunshine per year and vast wind resources, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the potential for renewable energy</span></span><span class='card-underline'> production in Central Asia </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is enormous</span></span>.

"The root of the problem is the disintegration of the resource-sharing system the Soviet Union imposed on the region until its collapse in 1991," the International Crisis Group, a conflict studies think-tank, said in a 2014 report entitled Water Pressures <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>in Central Asia</span></span>. Mountainous Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan had few natural resources, but boasted massive dams and hydropower plants. They used to receive coal and natural gas from downstream Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. The system was designed to turn Central Asia into a strategic source of cotton but fell apart by the late 1990s amid squabbles over energy pricing and unpaid debts, and "a plethora of bilateral and regional agreements and resolutions concluded in that decade failed to fix it," the report said. These days, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Kyrgyzstan is withholding water</span></span><span class='card-underline'> in massive upstream reservoirs releasing it according to electricity generation needs</span> - that is in winter - and not the interests of now-foreign farmers next door.

Hundreds of people were killed in violent ethnic clashes</span> in the Kyrgyz part of the Ferghana valley in 1990 and 2010, and the latter conflict prompted a brief exodus of hundreds of thousands of refugees. Unsurprisingly, the word "war" resurfaced when Moscow threw its weight and money to revive Soviet-era designs to build five more dams and hydropower stations in Kyrgyzstan. The Kremlin pledged to finance the $3.2bn project on the Naryn River, Syr Darya's tributary, as part of its political effort to restore its foothold in Central Asia. Uzbek President Islam Karimov wasn't very subtle with his warning.

However, over the last few years, the <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Communist Party has</span></span> clearly <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>turned its attention to</span></span> both military and <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>civilian intelligence reform</span></span>, including the creation of a foreign-intelligence-focused entity. Moreover, the recent uptick in arrests comes against a baseline of historically limited <span class='card-underline'>Chinese human intelligence activity directed at foreigners</span>. <span class='card-underline'>Chinese intelligence services have</span> long <span class='card-underline'>co-opted the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>growing number of Chinese</span></span><span class='card-underline'> nationals</span> living and <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>traveling abroad for intelligence purposes</span></span>, in part due to reduced risk. By leveraging a large network of individuals to each collect small pieces of information, the risk of detection and prosecution was diminished. But stealing valuable military and intelligence information requires the recruitment of American spies with privileged access to such information and in positions of scrutiny by U.S. counterintelligence entities—a far riskier proposition for China, potentially leading to embarrassment and international incidents. Thus far, that risk has made the relative anonymity of other espionage tools, such as cyber intrusions, more attractive for stealing government secrets. So <span class='card-underline'>why does China appear to have stepped up </span>this riskier form of <span class='card-underline'>human intelligence </span>now? What’s changed?

The establishment of Chinese military bases in the South China Sea, U.S. naval freedom of navigation operations, China’s declaration of air defense identification zones, U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, and potential U.S. military action in North Korea have all raised the risk of miscalculation by either the U.S. or China, which in turn has <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>motivated China</span></span> to redouble <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>efforts to better understand</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>U.S. military capabilitie</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>s</span>, <span class='card-underline'>readiness</span>, intentions, and <span class='card-underline'>decision-making</span> regarding any future crisis. And to assess intentions and decision-making, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>few tools are as effective as human intelligence</span></span>. For this reason, the past ten years have given China a strong incentive to increase human intelligence directed towards U.S. government employees in order to avoid a catastrophic confrontation with the United States. And alongside this new incentive, several factors have combined to benefit Chinese intelligence services and enable the growth of the country’s human intelligence operations. First, the <span class='card-underline'>free movement of people</span> and information <span class='card-underline'>throughout</span> the <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>globalized world facilitates human intelligence collection</span></span> targeting Americans. During the Cold War, few Americans and Chinese traveled between their respective countries. It was difficult for American agents of Chinese intelligence services to travel to or from the China without being caught. This intensified the risk of information and money transactions between countries. Since the Cold War, however, such barriers have largely fallen. The <span class='card-underline'>number of Chinese visitors</span> to the <span class='card-underline'>U.S. surged sixteen-fold to almost four million</span> between 2002 and 2017. In addition, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>immigration from</span></span><span class='card-underline'> the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>China to the U.S. has increased</span></span> from less than 40,000 annually in the late 1980s to almost 75,000 annually in 2015.

An electrical engineering professor at the University of Tennessee was convicted of collaborating with some of his Chinese students to send classified defense technology to the Chinese government in 2008. The U.S. Department of Justice charged six Chinese nationals with passing technology secrets from Avago Technologies Ltd. and Skyworks Solutions Inc. on to China in 2015.

To stop China from stealing classified information, Van Cleave recommends the U.S. go on the offensive against foreign spies. She laments the fact that former President Barack Obama weakened counterintelligence efforts by dividing America’s counterspy program into individual departments. Van Cleave continued: “The national head of counterintelligence was rebranded director of a security and CI center, his duties further dissipated by the fixation on leaks and insider threats driven by the grievous harm done by Snowden, Manning, et al.” She was referring to whistleblowers Edward Snowden and Bradley Manning. <span class='card-underline'>China continues</span> <span class='card-underline'>to use agents</span>, front companies and joint research ventures <span class='card-underline'>to steal American technology</span>. These <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>espionage activities</span></span> are helping to <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>undermine U.S. economic and military superiority</span></span>. In his book The Hundred-Year Marathon: China’s Secret Strategy to Replace America as the Global Superpower, American defense policy adviser Michael Pillsbury recounts how he first came across a strategy referred to as “assassin’s mace.” He read an article by three of China’s preeminent military strategists that discussed <span class='card-underline'>new tech</span>nologies that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>might allow </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>China to defeat America</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span>by using technology as a secret weapon. The article called for the development of tactical laser weapons to be used in antiship missile defense systems, electromagnetic pulse weapons, radar-jamming technology and cyberweapons. Maj. Gen. Li Zhiyun, the director of foreign military studies at China’s National Defense University, published an anthology of the works of 64 Chinese military authors. The anthology details a long list of <span class='card-underline'>U.S. military weaknesses vulnerable</span> <span class='card-underline'>to exploitation by</span> “<span class='card-underline'>assassin’s mace” technologies</span>. The most prominent weaknesses listed are America’s overreliance on high-tech computer systems, satellite technology, and long maritime supply lines. There are now <span class='card-underline'>25,000 Chinese intelligence officers working</span> for Beijing’s spy networks <span class='card-underline'>in the U</span>nited <span class='card-underline'>S</span>tates. This is according to a Chinese dissident with close ties to the Chinese government. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Stealing American tech</span></span>nology <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is a</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>major way</span></span> <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>China plans to develop</span></span> its <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>military</span></span><span class='card-underline'> to a point</span> where <span class='card-underline'>it could challenge</span> <span class='card-underline'>the U.S</span>.

Yet there is a sobering prophecy in the Bible that <span class='card-underline'>America’s military strength</span> will be <span class='card-underline'>cut off when it reaches</span> the <span class='card-underline'>zenith of its power</span>. “And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy chariots: And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy strong holds: And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand; and thou shalt have no more soothsayers: Thy graven images also will I cut off, and thy standing images out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands. And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee: so will I destroy thy cities” (Micah 5:10-14). This passage describes the military downfall of end-time Israel (the Americans, the British, the Jews and other related peoples). When end-time Israel reaches the zenith of its power, God cuts off its armaments of war and throws down its strongholds. He breaks the pride of its power. Why? Because the people have turned away from Him to embrace “witchcraft” and “soothsayers.” This means the people look to false teachers who refuse to teach God’s commands. They promote lawlessness and moral relativism. They endorse sins like abortion, adultery, drug abuse, homosexuality, lying and sexual promiscuity. They indulge in shallow religions, false doctrines and even literal witchcraft. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Espionage </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is a major way</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>America’s military strongholds could be thrown down</span></span>. <span class='card-underline'>China’s military is already on par with the U.S. in East Asia</span>.

The United States shares weapons, weapons systems, and operational plans with its allies and partners, many of whom China has targeted with espionage operations<span class='card-underline'>. China’s infiltrations</span> of these countries’ defense establishments <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>have significant implications for</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'>U.S. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>alliance stability</span></span>. If the United States perceives significant security risks in sharing information and equipment with its partners, it could hesitate to provide such support in the future.123 Even when China is not successful in extracting sensitive information, public reports of failed espionage attempts—such as the many recent reports of Chinese agents apprehended in Taiwan 124—could <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>undermine U.S. confidence in its partners</span></span> <span class='card-underline'>and contribute </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>to</span></span> a <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>deteriorat</span></span><span class='card-underline'>ion in bilateral </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>defense relations</span></span>. China’s infiltrations of the information systems of U.S. government organizations with a role in national security, along with infiltrations of the e-mail accounts of prominent U.S. government officials, could give China insight into U.S. government national security decision making and provide China with opportunities to manipulate it. These <span class='card-underline'>breaches could give</span> <span class='card-underline'>China insight into inter-nal U.S. discussions of issues relevant to U.S.-China contingencies</span>, potentially <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>allow</span></span><span class='card-underline'>ing </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>China to anticipate and counter U.S. actions</span></span>, including military operations. Moreover, these breaches could give Chinese intelligence information useful for targeting and recruiting agents for espionage and influence operations. The Chinese intelligence threat to U.S. national security will grow as China reforms and centralizes its intelligence apparatus and gains experience conducting intelligence collection operations. <span class='card-underline'>Its HUMINT operations</span>, in particular, <span class='card-underline'>already appear to be growing more aggressive and extensive.</span>125 China’s intelligence processing and communication to decision makers is likely to become more effective and efficient as the PLA moves toward joint, integrated intelligence operations. The potential resubordination and centralization of elements of the former PLA General Staff Department intelligence departments to the new Strategic Support Force also could create a more streamlined and well-coordinated intelligence apparatus. Conclusions • <span class='card-underline'>Chinese intelligence has</span> repeatedly <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>infiltrated U.S. national security organizations</span></span> <span class='card-underline'>and</span> <span class='card-underline'>extracted information with</span> <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>serious consequences</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>for</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>U.S. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>national security</span></span>, including information on the plans and operations of U.S. military forces and the designs of U.S. weapons and weapons systems. This <span class='card-underline'>information could </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>erode</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>U.S. military superiority</span></span> <span class='card-underline'>by aiding China’s military modernization</span> and <span class='card-underline'>giving China insight into the operation of U.S. platforms</span> and the operational approaches of U.S. forces to potential contingencies in the region. • China’s growing technical intelligence collection capabilities could strengthen China’s hand in a contingency. Its extensive network of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) assets and continued development and deployment of increasingly advanced ISR platforms will increase the ability of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to monitor U.S. forces. Moreover, the enhanced jointness of PLA intelligence at the theater level will facilitate the integration of data collected by these platforms to form a more comprehensive, real-time battlefield picture. • Chinese intelligence reportedly has repeatedly targeted and succeeded in infiltrating the personal e-mail accounts of leading U.S. government officials. These infiltrations could give China insight into highly sensitive U.S. national security decision-making processes. • <span class='card-underline'>China’s infiltration of</span> the <span class='card-underline'>national security establishments of U.S. allies and partners could allow China to indirectly access sensitive U.S. national security information</span>. Moreover, these breaches could undermine the strength and stability of U.S. alliances by causing the United States to hesitate to share sensitive information with its partners.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'><span class='card-highlight'>They say that immigration is not important / not perceived, therefore we have no link. However, our evidence shows that immigration is huge for white political calculus—it’s impossible for them to miss it.</span></div><div class='cite'>Marisa <span class='card-highlight'>Abrajano</span>, University of California San Diego and Zoltan <span class='card-highlight'>Hajnal</span>, University of California San Diego, <span class='card-highlight'>2017</span></div><div class='card-body'><p>[White Backlash: Immigration, Race, and American Politics http://pages.ucsd.edu/~zhajnal/resources/white-backlash-manuscript.pdf CBO DUDA]</p><p>Nevertheless, we believe that <span class='card-underline'>immigration and the Latino population</span> do <span class='card-underline'>impact whites’ core political calculus</span>. We offer a theory of how <span class='card-underline'>large scale immigration can result in real partisan shifts in the white population</span>. First, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the sheer size of the racial and demographic change</span></span> that has occurred and that continues to occur <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is impossible for white Americans to miss</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>.</span> All of this demographic change is accompanied by the extensive presence of Latinos, Asians, and other immigrants in the media and almost daily interactions with non-native speakers in the nation’s streets, workplaces, and neighborhoods. It would be surprising if such a massive change in the makeup of the nation did not result in immigration playing a more central role in the minds of white Americans. Second, <span class='card-underline'>irrespective of the actual fiscal consequences of immigration, there is an on- going and oft repeated threat narrative that links America’s immigrant and Latino populations to a host of pernicious fiscal, social, and cultural consequences</span> (Perez forthcoming, Chavez 2008, Hopkins 2010, Brader et al 2008, Santa Ana 2004). This narrative emphasizes cultural decline, immigrants’ use of welfare, health, and educational services, their propensity to turn to crime, and their tendency to displace native citizens from jobs (Huntington 2005, Borjas 2001, Gimpel and Skerry 2008). Each of these concerns has been spelled out repeatedly and in great detail in the media, in the political sphere, and in scholarly outlets (Perez forthcoming, Brader et al 2012, Chavez 2008, Santa Ana 2004). Moreover, although many inside and outside of the political arena dispute the threat narrative, it appears that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the narrative has been absorbed by a significant segment of the white population</span></span>. Across the white population attitudes on Latinos and immigration are diverse, but there is little doubt that <span class='card-underline'>many white Americans express real concerns about immigration and hold negative attitudes toward Latinos. Recent polls suggest that well over half of white Americans feel that immigrants are a burden on the nation</span>, a slight majority think they add to the crime problem, and about half believe they take jobs away from Americans (CNN 2010). <span class='card-underline'>For many, the changes that are occurring in America represent a real threat.</span> Third, and critically for our account, <span class='card-underline'>this threat narrative has recently taken on increasingly clear partisan implications</span>. Although there is still considerable variation within each party’s leadership on the issue of immigration, empirical studies demonstrate growing partisan divergence on immigration between leaders of the two parties (Jeong et al 2011, Miller and Schofield 2008). As we will see, these divergent stances on immigration are borne out by interest group ratings, voting patterns in state legislatures, elite partisan rhetoric, and the perceptions of the public. When Republican and Democratic leaders take divergent stances on immigration and other issues of special relevance to the Latino community and when Republicans stand more strongly against immigration<span class='card-underline'>, the two parties present individual white Americans with a stark choice. For those who are concerned about the Latino population and the growth of immigration, this may be reason enough to support the Republican Party.</span></p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'><span class='card-highlight'>Even if whites don’t notice on-the-ground immigration, biased reporting will push them to the right</span></div><div class='cite'>Marisa <span class='card-highlight'>Abrajano</span>, University of California San Diego and Zoltan <span class='card-highlight'>Hajnal</span>, University of California San Diego, 20<span class='card-highlight'>17</span></div><div class='card-body'><p>[White Backlash: Immigration, Race, and American Politics http://pages.ucsd.edu/~zhajnal/resources/white-backlash-manuscript.pdf CBO DUDA]</p><p>There are, we believe, clear partisan implications to all of this. <span class='card-underline'>By focusing on immigration and highlighting its negative aspects, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the media</span></span><span class='card-underline'> not only </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>generates fears and concerns</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, it also </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>increases the motivation for many Americans to side with the Republican Party</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.

We expect to find that <span class='card-underline'>whether we employ a question on ‘illegal’ immigrants, one on immigrants, or another that assesses views of the Latino population, our results will be strikingly similar.

And if immigrants are at the heart of the response, is it all immigrants or a subset of immigrants like illegal immigrants or Mexican immigrants</span>? Another possibility is that restrictive policy is directed more at a racial group that is most closely associated with the negative side of immigration (e.g. Latinos). Our imprecision stems largely from the fact that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>we believe these different categories tend to be muddled together in the minds of individual white Americans.

It is, therefore, likely that for most individual Americans, immigration is not a precise threat but rather more of a general concern generated by the changes that immigration is bringing to America</span>. In light of these muddled categories, we will undertake tests that in different ways measure attitudes towards Latinos, Asian Americans and other immigrant-related groups to try to get a clearer sense of just who or what it is that white Americans are reacting to.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'><span class='card-highlight'>Whites still hate legal immigration—it's about race not legal status</span></div><div class='cite'>Marisa <span class='card-highlight'>Abrajano</span>, University of California San Diego and Zoltan <span class='card-highlight'>Hajnal</span>, University of California San Diego, <span class='card-highlight'>2017</span></div><div class='card-body'><p>[White Backlash: Immigration, Race, and American Politics http://pages.ucsd.edu/~zhajnal/resources/white-backlash-manuscript.pdf CBO DUDA]</p><p>Another question we have yet to address is exactly <span class='card-underline'>who or what Whites are threatened by?

Is fear concentrated on a single nation-origin group like Mexican Americans</span> who represent a large share of immigrants and hail from a neighboring country with a large, porous border? <span class='card-underline'>Or alternatively, are concerns much broader</span>? Do the children of immigrants and even those who appear to be immigrants spur similar anxiety?

In reality, we think they tend to make only one real distinction – between Latinos and Asian Americans</span></span>. We argue that Latinos and Asian Americans should be examined separately because the two groups hold very different structural locations in American society and are viewed in distinct ways by white Americans. In terms of status, Asian Americans tend to fall near the top of the racial hierarchy while Latinos are disproportionately likely to fall near the bottom. Latinos are two or three times more likely than Asian Americans to be classified as living at or below the poverty line. Median Latino household income is only about half of median Asian American household income –the figures were roughly $60,000 and $30,000 in 2005. Differences in educational outcomes are just as stark. While only about 20 percent of Latinos currently graduate from college, almost 60 percent of Asian Americans do (United States Department of Education 2008).</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'><span class='card-highlight'>Americans oppose immigration regardless of immigrants' socioeconomic standing</span></div><div class='cite'>Marisa <span class='card-highlight'>Abrajano</span>, University of California San Diego and Zoltan <span class='card-highlight'>Hajnal</span>, University of California San Diego, 20<span class='card-highlight'>17</span></div><div class='card-body'><p>[White Backlash: Immigration, Race, and American Politics http://pages.ucsd.edu/~zhajnal/resources/white-backlash-manuscript.pdf CBO DUDA]</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Are white Americans, as much of the political rhetoric implies, really only concerned about the undocumented?

When we substituted in the state undocumented population or the state Mexican origin population into our regression models, both measures were generally significant and in both cases the size and direction of effects was similar to what we saw with our measure of the Latino population. A large percentage of undocumented/Mexican immigrants is associated with more conservative policy views, greater identification with the Republican Party, and increased support for Republican candidates. 125 All of this helps to demonstrate the robustness of our story but given the high degree of correlation between each of these different measures of the immigrant population, it unfortunately does not help to tell us which group white Americans see as most problematic<span class='card-underline'>. We also looked to see if the socioeconomic standing of the local Latino population affected white reactions. Perhaps Americans aren’t concerned about change in general but are instead worried about the influx of poor, unskilled, and uneducated immigrants</span>? However, when we re-ran the analyses adding a measure for the state Latino poverty rate and an interaction between the Latino poverty rate and Latino population size, we uncovered no new significant results. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>White Americans tended to be more regressive when they live in states with large</span></span><span class='card-underline'> Latino populations </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>whether the</span></span><span class='card-underline'> Latino </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>population was</span></span><span class='card-underline'> largely </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>poor or not.

This theory <span class='card-underline'>predicts that contact with out-group members reduces prejudice toward them</span>. The mecha- nism runs as follows: through contact, individuals are exposed to new infor - mation about the out-group. Such new information can improve the understanding of the other group’s concerns and interests, help develop affec- tive ties that reduce feelings of threat toward out-group members, disprove negative stereotypes, and consequently lead to more positive views of the out-group. Originally developed for the study of racial and ethnic groups, contact theory has since been applied to a wide range of different group set- tings. In a comprehensive meta-analysis of over 500 contact theory studies written between 1940 and 2000, Pettigrew and Tropp (2006) find strong sup- port for the notion that intergroup contact reduces intergroup prejudice across a broad range of different types of out-groups and contact settings. However, <span class='card-underline'>previous studies that have applied contact theory to under - stand natives’ attitudes toward immigrants arrive at mixed conclusions</span>. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Some studies find</span></span> that having friends or colleagues from ethnic minority groups or living in areas where <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>frequent contact with immigrants is more likely reduces</span></span> perceived threats and <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>anti-immigrant attitudes</span></span> (Ellison, Shin, & Leal, 2011; Fetzer, 2000; McLaren, 2003; Schlueter & Scheepers, 2010). <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Other studies report the opposite or null findings</span></span> (Gravelle, 2016; see also Ford, 1986, for a review). For example, Fetzer (2000) finds support for the contact hypothesis in France and the United States but not in Germany. Other studies find that local contact with immigrants can heighten rather than reduce feelings of cultural threat, which in turn increases anti-immi- grant sentiment (Berg, 2010; Enos, 2014; Hopkins, Tran, & Williamson, 2014; Johnston, Newman, & Velez, 2015; Karreth, Singh, & Stojek, 2015; Newman, Hartman, & Taber, 2012; see also Newman, 2013). Proponents of contact theory concur that some factors can curb the positive effect of con- tact on prejudice (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006, 2011). These factors are cur - rently “the most problematic theoretically, yet the least understood” (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006, p. 767). 1 In this article, we respond to the calls for further theoretical development of the factors that curb the positive effect of contact by focusing on political predispositions. We do so by incorporating insights from the study of moti- vated reasoning. Specifically, <span class='card-underline'>an extensive literature in psychology shows that individuals process information with a directional bias toward reinforc- ing their preexisting positions on a given issue</span> (see Kunda, 1990, for a review). <span class='card-underline'>That is, individuals use motivated reasoning, favoring arguments and evidence that support their existing views, while dismissing those that contradict them</span> (Nyhan & Reifler, 2010; Rogowski, 2016; Taber & Lodge, 2006).

Economists have a responsibility to carefully examine brain drain because it affects not only a single nation’s economy, but also the whole world’s economic system. Supply and demand could be imbalanced if supply outweighs demand. Developing countries are impacted from brain drain at more of a detriment. Skilled workers immigrate to more devolved countries to practice their professions. In a 2010 study, Gibson and McKenzie studied five countries and their top academic students to find their income would increase by $40,000-$60,000 per year if the gifted students were to move to a country more developed than their own. They believed these “barriers also restrict the extent to which lessskilled workers can react to the migration decisions of the higher-skilled,” due to limits in opportunity (2011). The migration of talented workers leads to fiscal decline when those students who relied on government subsidies leave and therefore no longer contribute as taxpayers (Gibson and McKenzie, 2011).</p><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Brain drain does </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>not show damaging results right away</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>; rather, it </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>takes time to produce</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> </span></span><span class='card-highlight'>any</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> significant economic effects</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. The worry of economists is that this problem will balloon to unmanageable levels and action will not be taken against the growth of Brain Drai</span>n. The issue is the highly education individuals who leave for better opportunities are the only source that can improve their countries’ economic systems. <span class='card-underline'>Developing nations rely on equilibrium, where they benefit from other countries’ stronger economies without those same economies drawing away all their resources, which include educated workers. Without this balance, there is no reinvestment back into their economy.</span></p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Indian growth strong now—brain drain reverses trend affecting key sectors </div><div class='cite'>Bhavthankar ’16 (“Brain drain now brain gain in ‘impatient’ India?:The growing strength of the Indian economy amidst a gloomy global scenario has made many Non Resident Indians (NRIs) to pack their bags and head back to India in search of better opportunities, writes ANIKET BHAVTHANKAR, http://theindiandiaspora.com/news-details/Spotlight/primary_news/brain-drain-now-brain-gain-in-%E2%80%98impatient%E2%80%99-india.htm)</div><div class='card-body'><p>The <span class='card-underline'>growing strength of the Indian economy amidst a gloomy global scenario has made many Non Resident Indians (NRIs) to pack their bags and head back to India in search of better opportunities. </span>Findings of a joint research by Duke University, University of Berkeley and the Kauffman Foundation for Entrepreneurship in the US confirm this trend.

The trend of reverse brain drain into India is <span class='card-underline'>not limited to the IT sector</span>, the country’s flagship growth driver. According to recruitment experts, it<span class='card-underline'> is very broad based and encompasses sectors like banking and finance, pharmaceutical, automobiles and textiles</span>. According to a recent report in Live Mint, among those who relocated to India recently and took up critical roles include Bharat Bhanushali who joined Fino Paytech as technology head and Krishna Hedge who was recently hired by Paytm to lead its consumer investment products. The <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>expats have found that together with the improvement in the economy, the eagerness of the Indian companies to expand globally has worked as key catalyst</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> In January this year, the Modi government launched a Start-Up India program to boost entrepreneurship and encourage new enterprises. As per NAASCOM, a trade association of Indian IT industry, India has the third largest Start-UP ecosystem in the world. This opens up unprecedented avenues for NRIs. Oversees Indians have shown keen interest to participate in this campaign and relocate in India. Akshay Ghulati, former head of Trade-In Amazon, is now Chief Business Officer of Kraftly mobile marketplace, a new business. Vineet Rao, who was with Microsoft in the US, has joined Start-Up campaign in an e-commerce space from Bengaluru. "Just everyone wants to be part of the chaos here in the Indian Start-Up industry, especially the Indians who left about 10 to 15 years ago and are now in their 30s or early 40s," said Navnit Singh, chairman and managing director at executive search firm Korn/Ferry International was quoted as saying in The Economic Times. <span class='card-underline'>The west has witnessed a slower economic growth in recent times, shrinking career opportunities.

Mallikharjuna Rao Komarneni, who came to the US in 2008 to do his PhD at the North Dakota University said with the better research opportunities in India and improvement in the environment to conduct scientific research, he aspires to return to India.

Compounding the technology theft, the administration of President Barack Obama weakened U.S. counterintelligence efforts against foreign spies by curbing national-level counterspy efforts, a former counterintelligence official disclosed during a House hearing. Michelle Van Cleave, former national counterintelligence executive, said shortly after the creation of the office of the director of national intelligence in 2004, a national counterspy program against foreign spies was restricted during the administration of President George W. Bush. "Unfortunately, the backsliding continued under President Obama," Van Cleave told two subcommittees of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee. Van Cleave said a directive issued by then-DNI James Clapper in 2013 and still in force reduced the national counterintelligence program authority by directing all counterspy programs to be run by individual departments or agencies. "The national head of counterintelligence was rebranded director of a security and CI center, his duties further dissipated by the fixation on leaks and insider threats driven by the grievous harm done by Snowden, Manning, et al," Van Cleave said, referring to intelligence leakers Edward Snowden, an NSA contractor, and Army Sgt. Bradley Manning. "Gone was any dedicated strategic [counterintelligence] program, while elite pockets of proactive capabilities died of neglect," she said. "Read between the lines of existing CI guidance and you will not find a whiff of a national-level effort left, other than caretaker duties such as taking inventory and writing reports." Several intelligence and security experts testified during the hearing <span class='card-underline'>that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>China poses</span></span><span class='card-underline'> the most </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>significant threat of technology theft</span></span><span class='card-underline'> from</span> an <span class='card-underline'>estimated $510 billion spent annually on U.S. r</span>esearch <span class='card-underline'>and d</span>evelopment. "China has a government-directed, multi-faceted secret program whose primary task is technology acquisition, as well as a highly refined strategy to develop and exploit access to advantageous information through the global telecommunications infrastructure," Van Cleave said. Along with Russian intelligence agents, Chinese technology spies have developed specific lists of technology for theft. Beijing uses clandestine agents, front companies, and joint research ventures in the theft program. "Indeed, the United States is a spy's paradise," Van Cleave said. "Our free and open society is tailor-made for clandestine operations." Michael Wessel, chairman of the congressional U.S.-China Economic Security Review Commission, testified that the <span class='card-underline'>Chinese are focused on</span> <span class='card-underline'>stealing American advanced technology related to a</span>rtificial <span class='card-underline'>i</span>ntelligence, <span class='card-underline'>robotics, and other cutting edge technology</span>. <span class='card-underline'>Beijing has</span> <span class='card-underline'>national-level programs to obtain advanced technologies</span> <span class='card-underline'>with both military and commercial applications</span>. They include acquisition of know-how related to new energy vehicles, advanced information technology, biotechnology, new materials, aerospace, ocean engineering, railway systems, robotics, power equipment, and agricultural machinery. "In the case of robotics and AI, two fields of study with the potential to fundamentally change the international economy as well as the future of war-fighting, China has released the Robotics Industry Development Plan and Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan with the goals of China assuming global leadership in the coming decades," Wessel said. China also is infiltrating American universities by funding language and cultural centers called Confucius Institutes that are being used as cover for technology theft. About 100 of the institutes are operating on American campuses and use their funding as part of "soft power" efforts in the United States. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>China is</span></span> also <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>using</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>some of the <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>350,000 Chinese students</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>in</span></span> the <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>U</span></span>nited <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>S</span></span>tates <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>for intelligence work</span></span>. Chinese spies recruit students with appeals such as "can you help China?" Wessel said. Recent spy cases have included an electrical engineering professor at the University of Tennessee, John Reese Roth, who in 2008 was convicted of illegally sending defense technology through Chinese students back to China. In 2009, Ruopeng Lieu, a researcher at Duke University, passed sensitive technology data to China. The information helped Beijing create the Kuang-Chi Science Ltd, a multibillion metamaterials company engaged in wireless internet and mobile payment fields. In 2015, Chinese professors were among six defendants charged with economic espionage by the Justice Department. An indictment charged stolen American trade secrets were used to assist Chinese universities and state-run companies in China. Wessel said 20 percent of those working on advanced artificial intelligence at the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Lab are Chinese nationals. Also, 30 of the 38 post-doctorial researchers at the University of Maryland's Bing Nano Research Group are from China, he said. "While we should continue to work to contribute to the world's efforts to address the most vexing problems facing the world, we must take greater steps to protect the fruits of our work," Wessel said. "Efforts to infiltrate our universities and labs and exfiltrate their work must be a greater priority." Van Cleave, the former counterintelligence official, said greater efforts are needed to stem the loss of technology to China. "Counterintelligence—identifying, assessing, and neutralizing foreign intelligence threats—has been little more than an afterthought in U.S. national security strategy, a legacy of neglect that has cost us dearly in lives lost, resources squandered, and dangers unchecked," she said. Counterspy efforts currently are divided among the FBI, CIA, and Pentagon. The division has created gaps allowing foreign spies to operate in the United States with impunity. Congress passed the Counterintelligence Enhancement Act in 2002 to fix the problems, but intelligence bureaucracies resisted the reforms and as a result counterspying has been weakened, not improved, Van Cleave said. "<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>U.S. counterintelligence</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is finely tuned to work individual cases</span></span>, but it is <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>not postured</span></span><span class='card-underline'> globally </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>to detect, deter, or disrupt</span></span><span class='card-underline'> the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>intelligence activities of China</span></span> or any other foreign power, or to execute strategic counterintelligence operations," she said.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Trump restricting visas for Chinese in tech and engineering</div><div class='cite'>Taylor Hatmaker 18 – Reporter for Tech.

A State Department official told The Hill that “Although the large majority of visas issued to Chinese nationals are issued for the maximum validity, consular <span class='card-underline'>officers may limit the validity of visas on a case-by-case basis” under the new rules</span>.

Chinese espionage aims at many sectors of our economy, even agriculture. Our government recently warned farmers to be wary of Chinese businessmen showing interest in genetically engineered seed and other commercial secrets—they may be spies. In January, Mo Hailong, one of six Chinese nationals Federal authorities accused of digging up seeds from Iowa farms to send back to China, pleaded guilty in a case that the Justice Department treated as a national security matter—not a normal criminal prosecution. This agricultural espionage ring was acting at Beijing’s direction, according to authorities familiar with the case, constituting the norm these days as Chinese spies seek any commercially valuable secrets they can pilfer from unsuspecting Americans. While <span class='card-underline'>Chinese espionage against</span> the <span class='card-underline'>U</span>nited <span class='card-underline'>S</span>tates is <span class='card-underline'>hardly new</span>, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>it has taken on fresh intensity</span></span>. Since few Chinese spies get caught, thanks to weak American counterintelligence and limited public awareness of this threat, the risk to Beijing is low while the rewards can be high. Relying on quantity of spies rather than quality is not especially cost-effective by Western standards but makes sense here. <span class='card-underline'>The </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>300,000 Chinese students</span></span><span class='card-underline'> at American universities </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>include a fair share of spies</span></span> and very few (if any) James Bonds. Many may not even be spying willingly, since offering up purloined baubles to the regime is often the price of studying overseas for Chinese students. Yet their task is to serve as low-level collectors of trade and other secrets that happen to cross their collegiate path, and that’s very difficult for American authorities to even notice, much less stop.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>China is using students, researchers, and spies---only terminating immigration solves</div><div class='cite'>Bill Gertz 18 – is an American editor, columnist and reporter for The Washington Free Beacon and The Washington Times.

"Our free and open society is tailor-made for clandestine operations." Michael Wessel, chairman of the congressional U.S.-China Economic Security Review Commission, testified that the <span class='card-underline'>Chinese are focused on</span> <span class='card-underline'>stealing American advanced technology related to a</span>rtificial <span class='card-underline'>i</span>ntelligence, <span class='card-underline'>robotics, and other cutting edge technology</span>. <span class='card-underline'>Beijing has</span> <span class='card-underline'>national-level programs to obtain advanced technologies</span> <span class='card-underline'>with both military and commercial applications</span>. They include acquisition of know-how related to new energy vehicles, advanced information technology, biotechnology, new materials, aerospace, ocean engineering, railway systems, robotics, power equipment, and agricultural machinery. "In the case of robotics and AI, two fields of study with the potential to fundamentally change the international economy as well as the future of war-fighting, China has released the Robotics Industry Development Plan and Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan with the goals of China assuming global leadership in the coming decades," Wessel said. China also is infiltrating American universities by funding language and cultural centers called Confucius Institutes that are being used as cover for technology theft. About 100 of the institutes are operating on American campuses and use their funding as part of "soft power" efforts in the United States. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>China is</span></span> also <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>using</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>some of the <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>350,000 Chinese students</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>in</span></span> the <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>U</span></span>nited <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>S</span></span>tates <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>for intelligence work</span></span>. Chinese spies recruit students with appeals such as "can you help China?" Wessel said. Recent spy cases have included an electrical engineering professor at the University of Tennessee, John Reese Roth, who in 2008 was convicted of illegally sending defense technology through Chinese students back to China. In 2009, Ruopeng Lieu, a researcher at Duke University, passed sensitive technology data to China. The information helped Beijing create the Kuang-Chi Science Ltd, a multibillion metamaterials company engaged in wireless internet and mobile payment fields. In 2015, Chinese professors were among six defendants charged with economic espionage by the Justice Department. An indictment charged stolen American trade secrets were used to assist Chinese universities and state-run companies in China. Wessel said 20 percent of those working on advanced artificial intelligence at the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Lab are Chinese nationals. Also, 30 of the 38 post-doctorial researchers at the University of Maryland's Bing Nano Research Group are from China, he said. "While we should continue to work to contribute to the world's efforts to address the most vexing problems facing the world, we must take greater steps to protect the fruits of our work," Wessel said. "Efforts to infiltrate our universities and labs and exfiltrate their work must be a greater priority." Van Cleave, the former counterintelligence official, said greater efforts are needed to stem the loss of technology to China. "Counterintelligence—identifying, assessing, and neutralizing foreign intelligence threats—has been little more than an afterthought in U.S. national security strategy, a legacy of neglect that has cost us dearly in lives lost, resources squandered, and dangers unchecked," she said. Counterspy efforts currently are divided among the FBI, CIA, and Pentagon. The division has created gaps allowing foreign spies to operate in the United States with impunity. Congress passed the Counterintelligence Enhancement Act in 2002 to fix the problems, but intelligence bureaucracies resisted the reforms and as a result counterspying has been weakened, not improved, Van Cleave said.

The United States shares weapons, weapons systems, and operational plans with its allies and partners, many of whom China has targeted with espionage operations<span class='card-underline'>. China’s infiltrations</span> of these countries’ defense establishments <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>have significant implications for</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'>U.S. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>alliance stability</span></span>. If the United States perceives significant security risks in sharing information and equipment with its partners, it could hesitate to provide such support in the future.123 Even when China is not successful in extracting sensitive information, public reports of failed espionage attempts—such as the many recent reports of Chinese agents apprehended in Taiwan 124—could <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>undermine U.S. confidence in its partners</span></span> <span class='card-underline'>and contribute </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>to</span></span> a <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>deteriorat</span></span><span class='card-underline'>ion in bilateral </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>defense relations</span></span>. China’s infiltrations of the information systems of U.S. government organizations with a role in national security, along with infiltrations of the e-mail accounts of prominent U.S. government officials, could give China insight into U.S. government national security decision making and provide China with opportunities to manipulate it. These <span class='card-underline'>breaches could give</span> <span class='card-underline'>China insight into inter-nal U.S. discussions of issues relevant to U.S.-China contingencies</span>, potentially <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>allow</span></span><span class='card-underline'>ing </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>China to anticipate and counter U.S. actions</span></span>, including military operations. Moreover, these breaches could give Chinese intelligence information useful for targeting and recruiting agents for espionage and influence operations. The Chinese intelligence threat to U.S. national security will grow as China reforms and centralizes its intelligence apparatus and gains experience conducting intelligence collection operations. <span class='card-underline'>Its HUMINT operations</span>, in particular, <span class='card-underline'>already appear to be growing more aggressive and extensive.</span>125 China’s intelligence processing and communication to decision makers is likely to become more effective and efficient as the PLA moves toward joint, integrated intelligence operations. The potential resubordination and centralization of elements of the former PLA General Staff Department intelligence departments to the new Strategic Support Force also could create a more streamlined and well-coordinated intelligence apparatus. Conclusions • <span class='card-underline'>Chinese intelligence has</span> repeatedly <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>infiltrated U.S. national security organizations</span></span> <span class='card-underline'>and</span> <span class='card-underline'>extracted information with</span> <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>serious consequences</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>for</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>U.S. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>national security</span></span>, including information on the plans and operations of U.S. military forces and the designs of U.S. weapons and weapons systems. This <span class='card-underline'>information could </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>erode</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>U.S. military superiority</span></span> <span class='card-underline'>by aiding China’s military modernization</span> and <span class='card-underline'>giving China insight into the operation of U.S. platforms</span> and the operational approaches of U.S. forces to potential contingencies in the region. • China’s growing technical intelligence collection capabilities could strengthen China’s hand in a contingency. Its extensive network of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) assets and continued development and deployment of increasingly advanced ISR platforms will increase the ability of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to monitor U.S. forces. Moreover, the enhanced jointness of PLA intelligence at the theater level will facilitate the integration of data collected by these platforms to form a more comprehensive, real-time battlefield picture. • Chinese intelligence reportedly has repeatedly targeted and succeeded in infiltrating the personal e-mail accounts of leading U.S. government officials. These infiltrations could give China insight into highly sensitive U.S. national security decision-making processes. • <span class='card-underline'>China’s infiltration of</span> the <span class='card-underline'>national security establishments of U.S. allies and partners could allow China to indirectly access sensitive U.S. national security information</span>. Moreover, these breaches could undermine the strength and stability of U.S. alliances by causing the United States to hesitate to share sensitive information with its partners.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Human intelligence is necessary for successful cyber espionage</div><div class='cite'>Scott Stewart 16 – Vice President of Tactical Analysis at Stratfor.

And when it comes to HUMINT operations against the United States, we are naturally drawn to the activities of the Russian intelligence services. Now let there be no doubt, Russian shenanigans with respect to the U.S. 2016 Presidential election have rightfully captured the attention of the nation, and placed the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the news on a daily basis. What isn’t being highlighted with the same degree of attention is the yeoman efforts of the counterintelligence professionals within the FBI and their colleagues across government in unraveling PRC intelligence efforts. 2017: THE YEAR OF THE CHINESE SPY? In the <span class='card-underline'>first six months of 2017, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>we have seen</span></span><span class='card-underline'> the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>arrest</span></span><span class='card-underline'> or conviction </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>of a number of individuals</span></span>, some Chinese citizens, most of them U.S. citizens, for their clandestine collaboration with the PRC intelligence services or operating on behalf of a state enterprise in stealing the defense, diplomatic or private sector information. Defense contractor, Kevin Mallory was arrested for espionage. He provided Secret and Top Secret documents, according to the Criminal Complaint filed by the Department of Justice The arrest of Candace Claiborne, a Department of State office management specialist. The arrest of Xu Jianqiang, who stole source code from IBM and shared it with a Chinese state owned entity. Five arrested for passing a U.S. company’s trade secrets to a Chinese entity. Nuclear engineer, Alan ho, pleaded guilty to violating the Atomic Energy Act and provided nuclear secrets to the PRC. This level of <span class='card-underline'>counterintelligence activity is both alarming and impressive</span>. ALARMING ACTS OF CHINESE ESPIONAGE With each of these cases we learn more and more about the PRC intelligence service’s modus operandi. Indeed with the Mallory case, we see the PRC issued him a covert communications device to use from within the United States to communicate with his PRC handlers in China. The device allowed Mallory to provide to the PRC the classified documents he was able to put his hands on, electronically and covertly. In this writer’s experience, one only issues covert communication devices to trusted and fully vetted assets. The pragmatist in each of us knows that these six cases do not constitute all PRC HUMINT activity. Lest we forget, the OPM data breach provided an intelligence targeting gold mine of cleared US employees and contractors to the Chinese. The PRC is not going to take it’s foot off the accelerator. IMPRESSIVE OPPORTUNITY FOR INSIDER THREAT PROGRAMS The optimist in each of us knows the insider threat programs we create will increase the likelihood that those who opt to break trust with the United States by engaging in espionage on behalf of a hostile foreign intelligence organization will be detected. So now is the time to double down on the counterespionage efforts within our respective companies, and protect both our company’s intellectual property and the nation’s secrets we have been trusted to protect.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Base support is an <span class='card-underline'>impenetrable wall against impeachment</span> – it’s the only thing preventing it</div><div class='cite'>David Roberts 17, writer at Vox, "America is facing an epistemic crisis," Vox, 11-2-17, https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/11/2/16588964/america-epistemic-crisis</div><div class='card-body'><p><span class='card-underline'>It is</span> similarly <span class='card-underline'>difficult</span> for most people <span class='card-underline'>to imagine believing</span> that Hillary Clinton has had multiple people killed, that Obama is a secret Muslim who wasn’t born in the US, that <span class='card-underline'>Trump had millions of votes stolen</span>, that Barack <span class='card-underline'>Obama</span> <span class='card-underline'>wiretapped Trump</span>’s White House, that Seth Rich (the mid-level Democratic staffer who was tragically murdered) was assassinated for stealing DNC emails and giving them to WikiLeaks, <span class='card-underline'>or that Antifa</span>, the fringe anti-fascist movement, <span class='card-underline'>will</span> begin <span class='card-underline'>go</span>ing <span class='card-underline'>door-to-door, killing white people</span>, starting on November 4.

In short, an increasingly large chunk of Americans believes a whole bunch of crazy things, and it is warping our politics. This basic story has been told plenty of times (my longer version is here), but the reason we should not let it out of our sights right now is the Mueller investigation. As Ezra Klein laid out, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>there is enough on the record</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span>now <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>to make it </span></span><span class='card-underline'>at the very least </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>highly probable</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span>that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>there was collusion </span></span><span class='card-underline'>between</span> the <span class='card-underline'>Trump</span> campaign <span class='card-underline'>and Russia</span>, <span class='card-underline'>meant to affect the</span> outcome of the <span class='card-underline'>election</span>.

What if there is no longer any evidentiary standard that could overcome the influence of right-wing media? The US is undergoing an epistemic breach Epistemology is the branch of philosophy having to do with how we know things and what it means for something to be true or false, accurate or inaccurate. (Episteme, or ἐπιστήμη, is ancient Greek for knowledge/science/understanding.) The US is experiencing a deep epistemic breach, a split not just in what we value or want, but in who we trust, how we come to know things, and what we believe we know — what we believe exists, is true, has happened and is happening. The primary source of this breach, to make a long story short, is the US conservative movement’s rejection of the mainstream institutions devoted to gathering and disseminating knowledge (journalism, science, the academy) — the ones society has appointed as referees in matters of factual dispute. In their place, <span class='card-underline'>the right has created its own</span> parallel set of institutions, most notably its own <span class='card-underline'>media ecosystem</span>. But the right’s institutions are not of the same kind as the ones they seek to displace. Mainstream scientists and journalists see themselves as beholden to values and standards that transcend party or faction. They try to separate truth from tribal interests and have developed various guild rules and procedures to help do that. They see themselves as neutral arbiters, even if they do not always uphold that ideal in practice. The pretense for the conservative revolution was that mainstream institutions had failed in their role as neutral arbiters — that they had been taken over by the left, become agents of the left in referee’s clothing, as it were. But the right did not want better neutral arbiters. The institutions it built scarcely made any pretense of transcending faction; they are of and for the right. There is nominal separation of conservative media from conservative politicians, think tanks, and lobbyists, but in practice, they are all part of the conservative movement. They are prosecuting its interests; that is the ur-goal. Indeed, the far right rejects the very idea of neutral, binding arbiters; there is only Us and Them, only a zero-sum contest for resources. That mindset leads to what I call “tribal epistemology” — the systematic conflation of what is true with what is good for the tribe. There’s always been a conspiratorial and xenophobic fringe on the right, but it was (fitfully) held in place by gatekeepers through the early decades of America’s post-war prosperity. The explosion of right-wing media in the 1990s and 2000s swept those gatekeepers away, giving the loudest voice, the most exposure, and the most power to the most extreme elements on the right. The right-wing media ecosystem became a bubble from which fewer and fewer inhabitants ever ventured. As <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>massive</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>post-election</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>study</span></span><span class='card-underline'> of</span> online <span class='card-underline'>media </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>from </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Harvard</span></span> (which got far too little attention) <span class='card-underline'>showed</span>, media is not symmetrical any more than broader polarization is. “Prominent media on the left are well distributed across the center, center-left, and left,” the researchers found. “<span class='card-underline'>On the right, prominent media are highly partisan.”</span><span class='card-underline'> </span>When mapping out sources of online news, researchers found that the two basic poles were the center-left and the far-right. The center of gravity of the overall landscape is the center-left. Partisan media sources on the left are integrated into this landscape and are of lesser importance than the major media outlets of the center-left. The center of attention and influence for conservative media is on the far right. The center-right is of minor importance and is the least represented portion of the media spectrum. In short, <span class='card-underline'>they </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>conclude, “conservative media is</span></span><span class='card-underline'> more partisan and </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>more insular</span></span> than the left.” That insular partisan far-right media is also full of nonsense like Pizzagate that leaves the base continuously pumped up — outraged, infuriated, terrified, and misled. At this point, as the stories above show, the conservative base will believe anything. And they are pissed about all of it. As Brian Beutler wrote in a scathing piece recently, the mainstream media has never learned to deal with the right-wing bubble — it has not learned how not to take bad-faith lies seriously. And now we will all reap the consequences. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The incentives facing GOP politicians are not good</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>For Mueller’s findings to have any effect, they will have to break</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>some part of</span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the basic dynamic on the right</span></span>. Here’s how it works: Pundits and yellers in right-wing media compete to freak out the base and reinforce its allegiance to Donald Trump. <span class='card-underline'>The base leans on politicians</span>. And <span class='card-underline'>most </span><span class='card-underline'>elected GOP</span><span class='card-underline'> officials</span> are in seats safe enough that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>they fear a primary challenge</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>from the base more than a Democratic</span></span><span class='card-underline'> challenger</span>. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The only way to stave off a primary is to pay obeisance</span></span>. That’s why Jeff Flake and Bob Corker are leaving the Senate. They no longer have any control over what their constituents believe or want, and their constituents believe and want increasingly ugly things. Sen. John McCain is saying all the right things now, but back when he faced his own Tea Party challenger, he sprinted right as fast as he could. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>GOP politicians</span></span> cannot (or <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>feel</span></span> that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>they cannot</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>)</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> cross the base</span></span>. And the base is currently being lied to about the Mueller investigation at a furious pace. The entire right-wing machine has kicked into high gear, led by the president himself, furiously throwing out chaff about Comey, Mueller, Obama, Hillary, the dossier, the uranium, the emails, and whatever else. On Monday, Fox News practically had a blackout of the Mueller news. Instead it covered fake Clinton scandals and cheeseburger emojis. It was such an embarrassing performance that multiple people on the news side leaked their disappointment to reporter Oliver Darcy. As always, the goal of this media/political offensive (there is no longer much distinction) is less to present some coherent alternative account of the facts than to fill the atmosphere with fog, to give those on the right enough cover to slough off the charges as yet another liberal plot. (See Vox’s Sean Illing’s great interview with Charlie Sykes, the conservative talk-radio host who criticized Trump and was excommunicated, for more on how this happens.) This reaction to Mueller in right-wing media was predictable enough. Similar things have happened so many times before, and been studied, analyzed, and documented. But to this day, no one knows how to stop or counter it. Mainstream institutions seem as unable as ever to resist its warping effects. It’s all playing out like some morbid script that we can only watch, stupefied. As familiar as this dynamic is, however, this episode is different. <span class='card-underline'>We are drifting perilously close to a serious constitutional crisis.</span><span class='card-underline'> </span>What if we find out Trump is guilty and just can’t do anything about it? As long as the base is convinced that Mueller is an agent of the deep state (or whatever), it will punish any Republican politician that strays from the pack and criticizes Trump. For a GOP officeholder, standing up for democratic integrity could mean sacrificing reelection in 2018 or 2020. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>As long as Republican</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>politician</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>s</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>are frightened by the base</span></span>, the base is frightened by scary conspiracies in right-wing media, and right-wing media makes more money the more frightened everyone is, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Trump appears to be safe</span></span>. As long as the incentives are aligned in that direction, there will be no substantial movement to censure, restrain, or remove him from office. What happens if nothing happens? Mainstream scholars do not think that Trump will be able to get away with simply ignoring Mueller’s findings or pardoning everyone involved. As Andy Wright, a law professor at Savannah Law School, put it, “with each abnormal, unbecoming, or dishonorable act, President Trump makes it harder for his appointees to defend him, harder for traditional Republicans to maintain their uneasy power alliance with him, and easier for Democrats to take the moral high ground and secure political advantage." But if there’s one thing non-experts like me have learned over the last few decades of watching US politics, it’s that experts are frequently caught flat-footed by the growing intensity of partisanship and the destruction of norms it has wrought. They are operating based on certain assumptions that it simply doesn’t occur to them that a politician can ignore. But politicians can. Mitch McConnell can simply refuse to hold a vote on a Supreme Court nominee. There’s no explicit rule or law that says he can’t, so he can, and he did. That one shocked and flabbergasted experts too, but just like all the other perverse steps down this road to illiberal lawlessness, they eventually took it on board and normalized it. Now they’re sure Donald Trump can’t simply brazen his way out of an indictment. What if they’re wrong about that? Say he pardons everyone. People will argue on cable TV about whether he should have. One side will say up, the other will say down. Trump may have done this, but what about when Obama did that? What about Hillary’s emails? Whatabout this, whatabout that, whatabout whatabout whatabout? There is no longer any settling such arguments. The only way to settle any argument is for both sides to be committed, at least to some degree, to shared standards of evidence and accuracy, and to place a measure of shared trust in institutions meant to vouchsafe evidence and accuracy. Without that basic agreement, without common arbiters, there can be no end to dispute. If one side rejects the epistemic authority of society’s core institutions and practices, there’s just nothing left to be done. Truth cannot speak for itself, like the voice of God from above. It can only speak through human institutions and practices. The subject of climate change offers a crystalline example here. If climate science does its thing, checks and rechecks its work, and then the Republican Party simply refuses to accept it ... what then? That’s what US elites are truly afraid to confront: What if facts and persuasion just don’t matter anymore? As long as conservatives can do something — steal an election, gerrymander crazy districts to maximize GOP advantage, use the filibuster as a routine tool of opposition, launch congressional investigations as political attacks, hold the debt ceiling hostage, repress voting among minorities, withhold a confirmation vote on a Supreme Court nominee, defend a known fraud and sexual predator who has likely colluded with a foreign government to gain the presidency — they will do it, knowing they’ll be backed by a relentlessly on-message media apparatus. And if that’s true, if the very preconditions of science and journalism as commonly understood have been eroded, then all that’s left is a raw contest of power. Donald Trump has the power to hold on to the presidency, as long as elected Republicans, cowed by the conservative base, support him. That is true almost regardless of what he’s done or what’s proven by Mueller. As long as he has that power, he will exercise it. That’s what recent history seems to show. <span class='card-underline'>Dem</span>ocrat<span class='card-underline'>s</span> <span class='card-underline'>do not</span> currently <span class='card-underline'>have the numbers to stop him. They can’t do it without some help from Republicans</span>. And Republicans seem incapable, not only of acting on what Mueller knows, but of even coming to know it.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Pence causes U.S.-Russia war </div><div class='cite'>Bobo Lo 17, Nonresident Fellow at the Lowy Institute, Associate Research Fellow with the Russia/NIS Center at the French Institute of International Relations, previously Head of the Russia and Eurasia Programme at Chatham House and Deputy Head of Mission at the Australian Embassy in Moscow, 10/25/17, “AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN: TRUMP, PUTIN AND THE US–RUSSIA RELATIONSHIP,” https://www.lowyinstitute.org/publications/accident-waiting-happen-trump-putin-and-us-russia-relationship</div><div class='card-body'><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>For the time being</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>, the Kremlin will keep faith with Trump</span></span><span class='card-underline'> as </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the least bad option</span></span>, consistent with the Russian adage, ‘hope dies last’ (nadezhda umiraet poslednei). <span class='card-underline'>That </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>hope</span></span>, however, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>would </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>die</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> if Trump were</span></span> either <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>impeached or forced to resign</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, and </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>replaced by</span></span> Vice President Mike <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Pence</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>.

As the battle over that new political order is enacted on the national stage, we have all become the dragooned antagonists in the play. This is what it is to live in the realm of the Big Man: his drama perforce is ours. <span class='card-underline'>Relentless political struggle, permanent revolution, shattering of norms, scandal and controversy, the capital hip-deep in broken crockery: this is what his supporters signed on for and this is what he is determined to give them; perhaps he knows how to give them little else</span>. <span class='card-underline'>To him </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>they are everything, his base</span></span><span class='card-underline'>: “This is a beautiful movement!”</span> “They’ve never seen a movement like this in our country before.” <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>They are his</span></span> creation, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>permanent suppliers of the adulation and self-affirmation he craves</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span>2 <span class='card-underline'>Now they cheer and hoot</span> and scoff while their hero, saber in hand, slashes and hacks at his enemies among the hated status quo. The latter include not just Stephen Bannon’s “handful of media elites” but many others who are appalled and outraged and find themselves forced to live under the pall of permanent political anxiety that hangs over the nation’s cities. It is our outrage, our disgust, our knee-jerk shock and condemnation that animate the play and give verisimilitude to the battle being fought. We are the enemy and our screams of dismay are vital to the drama. Behind the controversies about crowd size and alternative facts and illegal voters and Muslim bans, all the shock and alarm and political fatigue can be reduced to a dawning horrified recognition that <span class='card-underline'>President Trump is indeed…Donald Trump. His uttering a thirty-five-word oath</span> of office <span class='card-underline'>did not magically make him into someone else; he is determined to change the office much more than the office could ever change him</span>. How could anyone have doubted that President Trump would be Donald Trump plus great power and not Donald Trump plus great restraint? <span class='card-underline'>And</span> that he would be<span class='card-underline'> determined to use that newfound power to begin to do pretty much what he told his base he was going to do</span>? And—a final irony—that his very determination to break crockery and spread chaos and disruption is a major obstacle standing between him and the “new political order” whose birth his Svengali Bannon claims he will oversee. The necessity for continual disruption, constant outrage, maintaining an iron grip on the news cycle, and sheer winning without ever retreating means he has a grand proclivity for getting in his own way—“stepping on his own dick,” in political parlance—and we need, not for the first time, to let ourselves be grateful for that. It has thus far proved to be the hated status quo’s most important protection—not least because in very short order he has managed to produce a growing cadre of adversaries within the government itself. Most important, Trump’s aggressive and reckless sallies against intelligence professionals have secured him powerful enemies within the national security apparatus, who have increasingly been making use of their contacts in the elite press—particularly The Washington Post and The New York Times—to fight back and undermine his new administration. This is an important part of the so-called Russia scandal: that the “intelligence services,” in the words of Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, “seem to be at war” with the new president.3 That war has already claimed a high-level casualty in the person of General (retired) Michael Flynn, the president’s first national security adviser, who was fired after only twenty-four days in the job. Though Trump has railed against “illegal leaks” and declared that Flynn “was treated very unfairly by the media,” this side of the story—the bureaucratic war being waged against Trump from within the government—by its nature cannot be adequately told in the press itself, because reporters, however much they resist acknowledging it, in effect are vital players. This storyline is obscured, one might say, by the storytellers’ own shadows. Four weeks of the Trump ascendancy have been an ongoing seminar on where norms end and laws begin, on how much of what we had relied on when it came to the president’s conduct rested largely on a heretofore unquestioned foundation of centuries-old custom. That the president would express respect for the prerogatives of Congress and the judiciary, that he would acknowledge the country’s need for an independent press, that he would generally tell the truth and hold in respect the public record: in little more than the time it took to recite the oath of office much of this has been swept away. Donald Trump is a proud shatterer of these norms, and the louder the crash and splatter the better: for to his supporters such norms are nostrums, antiquated excuses for the elite’s own self-protection, and the wails of outrage and protest mean their hero is doing what they sent him to Washington to do. The norms are gone, perhaps never to be fully restored, and we have advanced now to the laws. The dividing line is surprisingly murky. That the president would not use his office to promote his personal business, for example, depends not only on the so-called emoluments clause of the Constitution but a good many subsidiary norms that Trump began shattering some time ago, when he refused to release his tax returns during the campaign. (His long-standing vow to release them once an audit was completed has been quietly abandoned.4) It seems plain now that in the near term the emoluments clause has in common with these norms that it requires political animation: that it has life only to the degree that those in power are willing to enliven it. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Thus far Republicans</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>in Congress, still stunned to find themselves enjoying an undreamed-of monopoly on power and struggling to craft a workable political program not based solely on ressentiment,<span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>have shown themselves </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>uninterested</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> in pressing Trump</span></span><span class='card-underline'> on his business entanglements and seem willing to stand by and let the presidency become a source of great wealth for the Trump family</span>. Thus do sacred cows perish, not with a bellow but with a whimper. Ours is famously said to be a government of laws, not of men, and yet we find in the Age of Trump that the laws depend on men and women willing to step forward and press them and that such are not to be found in the dominant party in Congress. Republicans are too divided and too focused on the main chance to move to protect what suddenly appear to be abstract principles. In an age when their party cannot muster a national popular vote majority they find themselves unaccountably in full possession of two branches of government and face the task of mastering their divisions sufficiently to pass a political program that won’t further doom them to the wilderness. This means adopting policies of opposition designed to cultivate and harvest resentment, such as repealing Obamacare, which provides health insurance to more than twenty million Americans, while somehow shaping them into a positive program that they can present to constituents as having improved their lives. It is a daunting task and thus far they show few signs of being up to it. Untroubled by norms, President Trump required only two weeks to come face-to-face with laws in the form not of Congress but of three judges of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Once again banning Muslims was what he had promised his base he would do. That the executive order itself was a legal mess in its drafting and in its execution stemmed both from the modus operandi that the <span class='card-underline'>Trump</span> team has adopted—policies closely held, drafts jealously sheltered from the eyes of those even in the departments or agencies responsible for carrying them out (taking a page from Dick Cheney’s post–September 11 playbook)—and perhaps from the desire of the president and his advisers to stage a fight with a major institutional force not yet recumbent before him: the judiciary. Thus the president’s assertion of his “unreviewable” powers in the face of “so-called” judges was not just absurd or ignorant but a bit of bait, establishing the basis for blaming the judiciary for any terrorist attack that was to come. On this he tweeted indefatigably and repeatedly: “Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril,” he said in his most explicit tweet. “If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!” Then: “I have instructed Homeland Security to check people coming into our country VERY CAREFULLY. The courts are making the job very difficult!” “People,” of course, are not “pouring in,” certainly not from the seven countries targeted. But the phrase <span class='card-underline'>links</span> once again <span class='card-underline'>the country’s vital security to the complex of issues at the heart of Trump’s “America First” politics: trade, immigration, and terrorism. Fortress America is being assailed by</span> foreigners who pour into the country and take our jobs, by <span class='card-underline'>elite technocrats</span> (“stupid people”) <span class='card-underline'>who negotiate trade deals that leave our borders unprotected, by traitorous businessmen who move factories abroad</span>, and by terrorists who take advantage of the nonexistent immigration safeguards to penetrate our shores. Everywhere the Other threatens. Everywhere the stupid, ineffectual, corrupt, self-dealing elites do nothing to protect the Forgotten American, in effect allying themselves with the threatening outsiders, becoming, in reality if not intent, traitors. As Trump proclaimed from the Capitol scarcely a month ago, “this stops, right here and right now.” But now “so-called judges” stand in the president’s way. The president will likely get his immigration ban, in one form or another, by backing up, rewriting the executive order, and proclaiming victory. Commentators will bemoan the fiasco that his first immigration rollout became. But Trump will have established the precedent of saddling the judiciary with responsibility for the next attack. Jack Goldsmith, the former head of the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel under George W. Bush and now a professor at Harvard Law School, notes that “Trump is setting the scene to blame judges after an attack that has any conceivable connection to immigration.” He goes on: If Trump loses in court he credibly will say to the American people that he tried and failed to create tighter immigration controls. This will deflect blame for the attack. And it will also help Trump to enhance his power after the attack. After a bad terrorist attack at home, politicians are always under intense pressure to loosen legal constraints. (This was even true for near-misses, such as the failed Underwear bomber, which caused the Obama administration to loosen constraints on its counterterrorism policies in many ways.) Courts feel these pressures, and those pressures will be significantly heightened, and any countervailing tendency to guard against executive overreaction diminished, if courts are widely seen to be responsible for an actual terrorist attack. More broadly, the usual security panic after a bad attack will be enhanced quite a lot—in courts and in Congress—if before the attack legal and judicial constraints are seen to block safety. If Trump assumes that there will be a bad terrorist attack on his watch, blaming judges now will deflect blame and enhance his power more than usual after the next attack.5 One might add that Trump’s executive order and the presidential Twitter assault on the judiciary that followed have set up the judiciary to be blamed following any attack, not just one having “any conceivable connection to immigration.” In his followers’ view Trump has acted to protect the country and “political” judges have blocked him. He has put them in a position to take the fall. Perhaps this was not the original plan but with Trump, it is safe to say, there will likely never be an original plan that plays out to the end. As the hapless Jeb Bush observed, Trump was “a chaos candidate and he’d be a chaos president.” Better to say that Trump uses chaos as a vital element in his tactics, perhaps having learned during his long career to capitalize on the chaos that his recklessness, ignorance, and aggression inevitably create. <span class='card-underline'>One might call the</span> resulting <span class='card-underline'>tactics “</span><span class='card-underline'>shock and opportunity”: Trump uses chaos to shock his opponents into varying crouches of outrage and contempt and then lunges forward amid the tumult wherever he sees an opportunity</span><span class='card-underline'> presenting itself.</span> No wonder he thinks of himself as the supreme “counter-puncher.” His virtuosity is in his opportunism. <span class='card-underline'>It is against this reality that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>we must see </span></span><span class='card-underline'>the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>likelihood of a crisis as the </span></span><span class='card-underline'>vital </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>springboard of a Trump presidency, </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>especially an increasingly shaky, unpopular, and unstable one</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The lower his poll numbers</span></span>, the more outlandish his lies, the greater the resistance from opponents within the bureaucracies, the thicker his scandals and chaos, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the likelier he will be to seek to use a crisis</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and all the opportunities it offers to lever himself from a position of defensiveness to that of dominating power</span>. It is impossible to say when <span class='card-underline'>such a crisis might</span> present itself or what it might <span class='card-underline'>be</span>: A confrontation with Iran in the Persian Gulf? <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>A dust-up with China over its claimed possessions in the South China Sea</span></span><span class='card-underline'>?</span> A terrorist attack on American soil? There is no way of predicting, but <span class='card-underline'>it </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is worth taking very seriously</span></span><span class='card-underline'> that some sort of crisis will come</span> and that, given Trump’s past behavior, his ruthless opportunism, and his drumbeat emphasis on “protecting the country,” such a crisis might well serve as a turning point in a Trump presidency, particularly one that is increasingly under siege. Consider the possibility of a terrorist attack on American soil, even a failed one. Not only would such an attack, as noted, put Trump in a perfect position to strike out at the judiciary, a major countervailing institution, it would offer him the political leverage to put down various rebellions within the bureaucracy, particularly within the intelligence agencies. There is no way to know whether such an attack will come but one can say that Trump, by attempting to strike out at Muslims generally, as he had vowed to do, has managed to place the Islamic State in the tempting position of being able to affirm, by attacking the United States, that it is the avenger of all Muslims. No accident that its propagandists have been nothing short of exultant, dubbing Trump’s executive order “the blessed order” and thus raising it to the level of the United States’ “blessed invasion” of Iraq as a miracle savior of its cause. If, as the Islamic State has asserted, the goal of its attacks in the West has been to “eliminate the gray zone”—to place “Muslims in the West…between one of two choices,” to either “apostatize or [migrate] to the Islamic State, and thereby escape persecution from the Crusader government and citizens”6—then Trump’s immigration ban goes far toward accomplishing the same thing: isolating Islamic communities, placing them all among a besieged minority whose travel is restricted and whose loyalty to their adopted countries is put in question. Already several jihadist tweeters asserted that the prophecy of the late Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born cleric killed in a drone attack in Yemen in 2011, that the “West would eventually turn against its Muslim citizens,” had been fulfilled.7 If one sought to design a policy to encourage radicalization, it would be hard to suggest a better one. One needn’t posit an administration master plan to notice that a further attack, even an unsuccessful one, will find the political ground well prepared. The panic over security that follows will open the way to a variety of measures to “protect the country,” few or none of which might have been necessary to prevent the attack in the first place. As we have seen, after an attack politicians seize the opportunity to act, not least to deflect blame from themselves, and we can expect President Donald (“The hour of action has arrived!”) Trump, after his repeated vows to keep the country safe, to act aggressively and comprehensively. How far he might go would depend on the severity of an attack, the ambitions of the administration, and perhaps how cornered the president feels himself to be. What measures might we expect under a Trump state of emergency? Probably strong steps against refugees, aliens, and immigrants. Suspending all entry of refugees. Widespread deportations. Expelling many green card holders. Further tightening and even suspending immigration. Mosques might be placed under surveillance, the much-discussed Muslim registry established. More broadly, and again depending on the severity of an attack, bulk collection of metadata might be reinstituted along with other forms of domestic surveillance. Long-standing constraints on the military and the CIA operating domestically might be loosened or eliminated. Black sites would be reestablished and torture reintroduced. The cells at Guantánamo, nearly empty now, would once again begin to fill. The standing post–September 11 Authorization for the Use of Military Force might be expanded or replaced, allowing unlimited military strikes abroad—and, perhaps, at home. The latter might lead, in the case of a particularly severe attack, to the suspension of habeas corpus. Certainly if such an attack were to come during the current Congress there is no reason to expect anything other than majority cooperation and support, not only for Trump’s specific responses to the attack but for the rest of his program. Democrats, whom Trump would denounce as worse than judges in their obstructionism, would be on the defensive. And the courts, whose pushback in any case would take much longer—as it did after September 11—will have been politically hamstrung by a commander in chief who will be in a position to declare, and to repeat, that he had warned the “political judges” not to second-guess him in what was needed to protect the country but that they had not listened. He will not be shy in saying the same about the press, “the most dishonest human beings on earth.” By then his political drama will have been elevated from a battle against elites and the status quo to a heroic struggle for the survival of the nation. As the hero was fond of telling his crowds during the campaign: if he lost, “we won’t even have a country anymore.” There is little reason to suspect they don’t believe it still and no reason to think he does not. “Never let a crisis go to waste,” President Obama’s first chief of staff was fond of saying. It is fair to expect that, in the face of opportunities to increase his power, destroy the opposition, and build his “new political order,” President Trump will once again gaze upon the darkening skies and see only sunshine.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>US-China nuclear war causes extinction</div><div class='cite'>Wittner 12 [Lawrence, PhD, Professor of History emeritus at the State University of New York/Albany, has written extensively about nuclear war, “Is a Nuclear War With China Possible?”, first published on 11/30/11 and updated on 1/30/12, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lawrence-wittner/nuclear-war-china_b_1116556.html]</div><div class='card-body'><p>But what would that “victory” entail? <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>An attack with</span></span> these <span class='card-underline'>Chinese </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>nuclear weapons would </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>immediately slaughter</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> at least 10 million</span></span><span class='card-underline'> Americans </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>in a </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>great storm of blast and fire</span></span>, while <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>leaving many more </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>dying horribly of sickness and radiation poisoning.</span></span><span class='card-underline'> The Chinese death toll in a nuclear war would be </span><span class='card-underline'>far higher</span><span class='card-underline'>. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Both nations would be reduced to </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>smoldering, radioactive wastelands</span></span>.

As the battle over that new political order is enacted on the national stage, we have all become the dragooned antagonists in the play. This is what it is to live in the realm of the Big Man: his drama perforce is ours. <span class='card-underline'>Relentless political struggle, permanent revolution, shattering of norms, scandal and controversy, the capital hip-deep in broken crockery: this is what his supporters signed on for and this is what he is determined to give them; perhaps he knows how to give them little else</span>. <span class='card-underline'>To him </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>they are everything, his base</span></span><span class='card-underline'>: “This is a beautiful movement!”</span> “They’ve never seen a movement like this in our country before.” <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>They are his</span></span> creation, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>permanent suppliers of the adulation and self-affirmation he craves</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span>2 <span class='card-underline'>Now they cheer and hoot</span> and scoff while their hero, saber in hand, slashes and hacks at his enemies among the hated status quo. The latter include not just Stephen Bannon’s “handful of media elites” but many others who are appalled and outraged and find themselves forced to live under the pall of permanent political anxiety that hangs over the nation’s cities. It is our outrage, our disgust, our knee-jerk shock and condemnation that animate the play and give verisimilitude to the battle being fought. We are the enemy and our screams of dismay are vital to the drama. Behind the controversies about crowd size and alternative facts and illegal voters and Muslim bans, all the shock and alarm and political fatigue can be reduced to a dawning horrified recognition that <span class='card-underline'>President Trump is indeed…Donald Trump. His uttering a thirty-five-word oath</span> of office <span class='card-underline'>did not magically make him into someone else; he is determined to change the office much more than the office could ever change him</span>. How could anyone have doubted that President Trump would be Donald Trump plus great power and not Donald Trump plus great restraint? <span class='card-underline'>And</span> that he would be<span class='card-underline'> determined to use that newfound power to begin to do pretty much what he told his base he was going to do</span>? And—a final irony—that his very determination to break crockery and spread chaos and disruption is a major obstacle standing between him and the “new political order” whose birth his Svengali Bannon claims he will oversee. The necessity for continual disruption, constant outrage, maintaining an iron grip on the news cycle, and sheer winning without ever retreating means he has a grand proclivity for getting in his own way—“stepping on his own dick,” in political parlance—and we need, not for the first time, to let ourselves be grateful for that. It has thus far proved to be the hated status quo’s most important protection—not least because in very short order he has managed to produce a growing cadre of adversaries within the government itself. Most important, Trump’s aggressive and reckless sallies against intelligence professionals have secured him powerful enemies within the national security apparatus, who have increasingly been making use of their contacts in the elite press—particularly The Washington Post and The New York Times—to fight back and undermine his new administration. This is an important part of the so-called Russia scandal: that the “intelligence services,” in the words of Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, “seem to be at war” with the new president.3 That war has already claimed a high-level casualty in the person of General (retired) Michael Flynn, the president’s first national security adviser, who was fired after only twenty-four days in the job. Though Trump has railed against “illegal leaks” and declared that Flynn “was treated very unfairly by the media,” this side of the story—the bureaucratic war being waged against Trump from within the government—by its nature cannot be adequately told in the press itself, because reporters, however much they resist acknowledging it, in effect are vital players. This storyline is obscured, one might say, by the storytellers’ own shadows. Four weeks of the Trump ascendancy have been an ongoing seminar on where norms end and laws begin, on how much of what we had relied on when it came to the president’s conduct rested largely on a heretofore unquestioned foundation of centuries-old custom. That the president would express respect for the prerogatives of Congress and the judiciary, that he would acknowledge the country’s need for an independent press, that he would generally tell the truth and hold in respect the public record: in little more than the time it took to recite the oath of office much of this has been swept away. Donald Trump is a proud shatterer of these norms, and the louder the crash and splatter the better: for to his supporters such norms are nostrums, antiquated excuses for the elite’s own self-protection, and the wails of outrage and protest mean their hero is doing what they sent him to Washington to do. The norms are gone, perhaps never to be fully restored, and we have advanced now to the laws. The dividing line is surprisingly murky. That the president would not use his office to promote his personal business, for example, depends not only on the so-called emoluments clause of the Constitution but a good many subsidiary norms that Trump began shattering some time ago, when he refused to release his tax returns during the campaign. (His long-standing vow to release them once an audit was completed has been quietly abandoned.4) It seems plain now that in the near term the emoluments clause has in common with these norms that it requires political animation: that it has life only to the degree that those in power are willing to enliven it. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Thus far Republicans</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>in Congress, still stunned to find themselves enjoying an undreamed-of monopoly on power and struggling to craft a workable political program not based solely on ressentiment,<span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>have shown themselves </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>uninterested</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> in pressing Trump</span></span><span class='card-underline'> on his business entanglements and seem willing to stand by and let the presidency become a source of great wealth for the Trump family</span>. Thus do sacred cows perish, not with a bellow but with a whimper. Ours is famously said to be a government of laws, not of men, and yet we find in the Age of Trump that the laws depend on men and women willing to step forward and press them and that such are not to be found in the dominant party in Congress. Republicans are too divided and too focused on the main chance to move to protect what suddenly appear to be abstract principles. In an age when their party cannot muster a national popular vote majority they find themselves unaccountably in full possession of two branches of government and face the task of mastering their divisions sufficiently to pass a political program that won’t further doom them to the wilderness. This means adopting policies of opposition designed to cultivate and harvest resentment, such as repealing Obamacare, which provides health insurance to more than twenty million Americans, while somehow shaping them into a positive program that they can present to constituents as having improved their lives. It is a daunting task and thus far they show few signs of being up to it. Untroubled by norms, President Trump required only two weeks to come face-to-face with laws in the form not of Congress but of three judges of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Once again banning Muslims was what he had promised his base he would do. That the executive order itself was a legal mess in its drafting and in its execution stemmed both from the modus operandi that the <span class='card-underline'>Trump</span> team has adopted—policies closely held, drafts jealously sheltered from the eyes of those even in the departments or agencies responsible for carrying them out (taking a page from Dick Cheney’s post–September 11 playbook)—and perhaps from the desire of the president and his advisers to stage a fight with a major institutional force not yet recumbent before him: the judiciary.

It is fair to expect that, in the face of opportunities to increase his power, destroy the opposition, and build his “new political order,” President Trump will once again gaze upon the darkening skies and see only sunshine.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>US-China nuclear war causes extinction</div><div class='cite'>Wittner 12 [Lawrence, PhD, Professor of History emeritus at the State University of New York/Albany, has written extensively about nuclear war, “Is a Nuclear War With China Possible?”, first published on 11/30/11 and updated on 1/30/12, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lawrence-wittner/nuclear-war-china_b_1116556.html]</div><div class='card-body'><p>But what would that “victory” entail? <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>An attack with</span></span> these <span class='card-underline'>Chinese </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>nuclear weapons would </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>immediately slaughter</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> at least 10 million</span></span><span class='card-underline'> Americans </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>in a </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>great storm of blast and fire</span></span>, while <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>leaving many more </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>dying horribly of sickness and radiation poisoning.</span></span><span class='card-underline'> The Chinese death toll in a nuclear war would be </span><span class='card-underline'>far higher</span><span class='card-underline'>. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Both nations would be reduced to </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>smoldering, radioactive wastelands</span></span>.

Then there is the subject that touches every American — the economy — and Trump is doing so well on that front that even the New York Times had to admit it “ran out of words to describe how good the job numbers are.” Since Trump took office, nearly 3 million jobs have been created, and wage growth is at the highest point since President Bush left office. Unemployment has dipped to its lowest level since 2000 and to record lows for African Americans and Asians. Manufacturing jobs are increasingacross the country, and two-thirds of Americans say the economy is “good.” On top of that, efforts by Obama supporters to give their man credit for the economic numbers have crumbled in recent months. Republican congressional candidates are right to worry whether Trump’s coattails and loyal supporters are enough to keep them in control of Congress beyond this year. The Senate seems safe for now. But the battle for control of the House remains a toss-up, Democrats continue to hold a small-but-stubborn lead in the generic ballot question, and there is no guarantee, particularly as political turmoil in Italy threatens the European Union economy, the economy still will be a political plus come November. <span class='card-underline'>There is no-one-size-fits-all solution for Republicans to win in 2018</span>.

Way back in ... 2015</span>? For more than a decade — ever since the Bush administration failed to pass comprehensive immigration reform in 2006 and 2007 — conventional wisdom has said that Congress can’t pass immigration bills because of the “amnesty” problem. Any proposal to legalize some or all of the 11 million unauthorized immigrants living in the US would be toxic to many Republicans; any proposal without any legalization would be toxic to many Democrats. Rahm Emanuel, who was chief of staff in the early years of the Obama White House, famously said that “immigration is the third rail of politics,” but he meant unauthorized immigration (or rather, what to do about unauthorized immigrants). Legal immigration was a tricky policy issue that business and labor fought over, but it wasn’t going to cost any votes on the Senate floor or in elections. That era is over. <span class='card-underline'>In the midst of a messy Senate debate over immigration policy, it’s now clear that the most contentious question in Congress is one that’s been dormant in legislative fights for years: whether or not to cut legal immigration. This is almost entirely the doing of </span>President Donald <span class='card-underline'>Trump</span>. Over the course of two and a half years, as a candidate, nominee, and now president, <span class='card-underline'>he’s turned a fringe right-wing view into the heart of the current congressional debate over immigration.

Nor was he the only person running as an immigration hawk. But while other Republicans went to pains rhetorically to emphasize that legal immigration was good and important and part of the American dream, Trump didn’t bother. His descriptions of Mexico “sending” over bad people could be interpreted as illegal border-crossers or immigration generally, depending on what listeners wanted to hear. <span class='card-underline'>He depicted would-be legal refugees as ISIS moles.</span> <span class='card-underline'>From his first proposal of a “Muslim ban</span>” in December 2015 to his responses to terror attacks in fall 2017, <span class='card-underline'>he has taken the stance that the only way to prevent terrorists from entering the US is to block the paths that individual terrorists have taken to immigrate here in the past — shutting the door behind them and </span><span class='card-underline'>locking out tens of thousands of immigrants per year</span><span class='card-underline'>, or more. </span>When Trump launched his campaign, Sen.

At this point, that's old news. But not everyone has a good grasp on the granular parts of presidential approval?how intensely people feel about the president, which groups do and don't like him and how much that matters for the midterms and our understanding of public opinion in the Trump era more generally. That's why <span class='card-underline'>I spent</span> some <span class='card-underline'>time with a </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>new, centralized data</span></span><span class='card-underline'>set </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>from</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>SurveyMonkey</span></span> that deals with these questions. I looked through their data, did some math, and came up with four different charts that demonstrate some of the most important facts about Trump's approval rating. Before getting started, I have one quick note for readers who might be confused because they have personal experience either making or filling out very non-political polls on SurveyMonkey. This is that same SurveyMonkey ? the company just also usse its platform to conduct scientific political surveys. Mark Blumenthal, head of election polling, explained it to me: "We draw random samples of those who have just completed a survey on our platform and invite them to answer a few more questions about important issues and current events, including Trump approval" and then they "statistically adjust the data so it is representative of the American public." So here are the graphics and the explanations: There Aren't (And Never Have Been) Many Lukewarm Trump Disapprovers The conventional wisdom on politics is often wrong. But these polls show that it's right about one thing ? Americans who don't like Trump really don't like him. This graphic shows the percentage of Trump disapprovers who "strongly" or "somewhat" disapprove of Trump's job performance in a series of SurveyMonkey polls stretching from January 2017 to now. The top line tells most of the story. If you put every American who disapproves of Trump in a room (usually more than half of the people that SurveyMonkey polls) and picked someone randomly, the odds of picking a "strong disapprover" would be greater than 3-to-1. This is a problem for down-ballot Republicans. Democrats have won some high profile races (like the special election in Pennsylvania's 18th District) partially by riding strong anti-Trump sentiment. The president has motived Democrats to turn out at a high rate while driving some more typical GOP voters to cast their ballot for the blue team. That anti-Trump enthusiasm is part of the reason Democrats are currently the favorites to take the House in November. <span class='card-underline'>Trump's Base is More Divided Than Many Think </span>The conventional wisdom is a little less helpful when it comes to Trump supporters. Diehard Trump supporters have garnered a lot of media attention, but <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>not every Trump approver is enthusiastic</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>This</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>graphic <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>nearly identical to the previous</span></span><span class='card-underline'> one</span>?<span class='card-underline'>the difference is that we're comparing strong Trump approvers and those who only somewhat approve </span>of the president's job performance. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>In most</span></span><span class='card-underline'> of SurveyMonkey's </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>polls, </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>strong Trump approvers outnumbered those who approved somewhat</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, but the split isn't as lopsided</span> as it is Trump disapprovers (this is similar to what we've seen in YouGov polls of Trump voters). Maybe more interestingly, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the mix</span></span><span class='card-underline'> of somewhat and strong Trump approvers seems to have </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>changed</span></span><span class='card-underline'> at least </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>a little bit</span></span><span class='card-underline'> over time. </span>Every poll is noisy, so these shifts shouldn't be overinterpreted.

He has hurled insults at governors, senators, a judge who recently ruled against him and Miss Universe 2014. He has also attacked the press, arguing that as president he will “open up” libel laws so he can sue newspapers that publish “purposely negative and horrible and false articles” about him. Mr. Trump’s critics wonder whether a man with such a violent temper can be trusted with the presidency. <span class='card-underline'>But his defenders, like Senator John McCain and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, assure us that the Constitution will constrain him</span>. “I still believe we have the institutions of government that would restrain someone who seeks to exceed their constitutional obligations,” Mr. McCain told The New York Times. “We have a Congress. We have the Supreme Court. We’re not Romania.” Under the principle of separation of powers, the president shares power with Congress and the judiciary. The party system, the press and American political traditions may constrain him as well. But what would this mean in practice if Mr. Trump wins? It depends on what Mr. Trump wants to do. His signature issues are immigration and trade. He could not build the Mexican wall without congressional support. Bu<span class='card-underline'>t </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>he could order immigration authorities to deport unauthorized immigrants. And he could bar Muslims from entering the country under existing law, which authorizes him to bar classes of aliens whose entry he determines “would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.”</span></span><span class='card-underline'> It wouldn’t be the first time: President Ronald Reagan cited this law, as well as his inherent constitutional powers, to block a flood of Haitian migrants from pouring into United States territory in 1981</span>. Can he slap tariffs on China, as he has threatened? Yes, he can. <span class='card-underline'>Congress has delegated to the president the power to retaliate against foreign countries that engage in unfair trade practices like dumping, leaving it to the president and trade officials to determine what that means. In 2002, President George W. Bush imposed steel tariffs on China and other countries for what many observers considered political reasons.</span> The World Trade Organization ruled the steel tariffs illegal in that case. But <span class='card-underline'>Mr. Trump could simply ignore its judgment, and indeed withdraw the United States from the W.T.O., just as President Bush withdrew the United States from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty in 2002</span>. While he’s at it, Mr<span class='card-underline'>. Trump could tear up the North Atlantic Treaty, which created NATO, an organization that he has called “obsolete.”</span> In May, Mr. <span class='card-underline'>Trump vowed to rescind President Obama’s environmental policies. He would be able to do that as well. He could disavow the Paris climate change agreement, just as President Bush “unsigned” a treaty creating an international criminal court in 2002. He could choke off climate regulations that are in development and probably withdraw existing climate regulations. Even if a court blocked him, he could refuse to enforce the regulations, just as Mr. Obama refused to enforce immigration laws</span>. In wielding executive power in these ways, Mr. <span class='card-underline'>Trump would be following in the footsteps of his predecessors. President Bush cited his commander in chief powers in order to justify interrogation, surveillance and detention polices in the wake of Sept. 11.</span> While Mr. <span class='card-underline'>Obama</span> has shied away from Mr. Bush’s constitutional arguments, <span class='card-underline'>he has interpreted statutes aggressively, while also relying on constitutional authorities, to justify the military intervention in Libya in 2011 and his nonenforcement of immigration laws</span>. Mr. Trump has expressed impatience with his critics and hinted that he would use federal powers against them. He wouldn’t be able to put someone in jail merely for criticizing him. But <span class='card-underline'>he could direct agencies to use their vast regulatory powers against the companies of executives who have displeased him, like Jeff Bezos, for example, the founder of Amazon. Mr. Trump has already hinted that he would go after Amazon for supposed antitrust violations. He could direct the Department of Justice to investigate his critics by prioritizing categories of crimes they may have committed. Political opponents could be accused of campaign finance law violations. Former government officials, like Hillary Clinton, could be accused of violating secrecy laws.</span> Even if the charges come to nothing, <span class='card-underline'>the legal fees for defendants will be hefty</span>. Mr. <span class='card-underline'>Trump could also crack down on journalists who report on national security issues by enforcing federal secrecy laws more aggressively than previous presidents.</span> President Obama received a lot of criticism for prosecuting government employees who leaked secrets, but the Justice Department did not bring charges against the journalists who published the leaked information. What couldn’t Mr. Trump do? He couldn’t lower (or raise) taxes on his own. He’s supposed to spend funds that Congress appropriates and for the things that Congress appropriates them for — that’s what stands in the way of the wall (unless he persuades Mexico to pay for it and construct it on the other side of the border). He could not follow through on his promise to impose the death penalty on killers of police officers by executive order. And even where he does act, he needs to make sure his legal theories are in order. If he wanted to withdraw climate regulations because climate change is a hoax perpetuated by China, no court would allow him to. But if he said that the climate regulations were based on a speculative assessment of harms that wouldn’t occur for 100 years, he could succeed. Much depends on how far Mr. Trump is willing to push existing legal understandings. <span class='card-underline'>There is a netherworld of laws that presidents are supposed to comply with but courts don’t enforce. He could send military forces into a foreign country without authorization from Congress; courts would most likely stay out of the dispute. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>What of his suggestion earlier this year to kill the families of terrorists? Courts typically defer to the executive on matters concerning military activities abroad</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. He might even try to withhold appropriated funds or shift them around in defiance of Congress’s wishes</span>. What, then, stands between us and a nearly unbounded Mr. Trump, aside from the next election? Senators McCain and McConnell say Congress, but <span class='card-underline'>only a veto-proof majority in both houses, passing new laws, could stop Mr. Trump from exercising the legal authority that Congress has already given the president. Congress can threaten to withhold funds, but the president’s powers to veto legislation and appoint government officers give him a large bargaining chip</span>. Removal of a president by impeachment is extremely difficult; it has never happened. <span class='card-underline'>The courts are another barrier, but they would need to reverse their longstanding practice of deferring to the president in matters of foreign affairs and domestic regulation</span>. The Supreme Court could, for example, declare an entry bar on Muslims unconstitutional. But it’s hard to predict how Mr. Trump would respond. After a federal judge, Gonzalo Curiel, ruled against him on a motion in the long-running Trump University litigation, Mr. Trump called him a “hater” and a “Mexican” (Judge Curiel is an American). Mr. Trump’s biggest obstacle to vast power is not the separation of powers but the millions of federal employees who are supposed to work for him. Most of these employees have a strong sense of professionalism and are dedicated to the mission of their agency. They don’t take kindly to arbitrary orders from above. As President Harry Truman said ahead of Dwight D. Eisenhower’s presidency: “He’ll sit here, and he’ll say, ‘Do this! Do that!’ And nothing will happen.” To make things happen, Mr. Trump will need to get loyalists into leadership positions of the agencies, but to do so, he will need the cooperation of the Senate (or he will need to aggressively exploit his recess appointment powers). Moreover, the small number of politically appointed leaders enjoy only limited control of the mass of civil servants. These employees can drag their feet, leak to the press, threaten to resign and employ other tactics to undermine Mr. Trump’s initiatives if they object to them. They’re also hard to fire, thanks to Civil Service protections. But Mr. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Trump can fight back. He can appoint loyalists not only to political positions in the executive branch, but to the courts, and he may be able to attract them to the ranks of the Civil Service</span></span>. And while executive branch officials who disregard the law might be prosecuted by the Justice Department, President <span class='card-underline'>Trump would have one more trick up his sleeve. Like President George H.W. Bush, who rescued Iran-contra defendants from punishment in 1992, he could hand out get-out-of-jail-free cards in the form of the pardon.</span></p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'><<Good card>> There are no checks and balances</div><div class='cite'>Freedland 17 (8/11, Jonathan, The Guardian, “Trump is the real nuclear threat, and we can’t just fantasise him away”, https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/11/trump-nuclear-threat-deep-state-fantasy-north-korea)</div><div class='card-body'><p>Among the many terrifying facts that have emerged in the last several days, perhaps the scariest relate to the nuclear button over which now hovers the finger of Donald Trump. It turns out that, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>of all the powers held by this or any other US president</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the least checked or balanced is his </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>authority over the world’s mightiest arsenal</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>He exercises this awesome, civilisation-ending</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>power alone</span></span>. As Trump has learned in recent months, the man in the Oval Office cannot simply issue a decree changing, say, the US healthcare system. He has to build majorities in the House and Senate, which is harder than it looks. If he wants to change immigration policy, a mere order is not enough. He can be stopped by the courts, as Trump saw with his travel ban. But <span class='card-underline'>if he wants to rain fire</span> <span class='card-underline'>and fury on a distant enemy, bringing more fire and fury down on his own citizens</span> and many hundreds of millions of others, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>there is no one standing in his way</span></span>. Not for nothing does the geopolitical literature refer to the US president as the “nuclear monarch.” The more you hear of the simplicity of the system, the more frightening it becomes. <span class='card-underline'>If Trump decides he has had enough of Kim Jong-un’s verbal threats</span>, <span class='card-underline'>he merely has to turn to the low-level military aide at his side and ask them to open up the black briefcase</span> that officer keeps permanently in their grasp. The bag is known as the nuclear “football”. (It gets its name from the code word for the very first set of nuclear war plans: dropkick.) Inside the bag is a menu of options, explained in detail in a “black book,” but also set out in a single, cartoon-like page for speedy comprehension. Trump has only to make his choice, pick up the phone to the Pentagon war room, utter the code words that identify him as the president and give the order. That’s it. The officer who receives the call at the Pentagon has no authority to question or challenge the order. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>There is no need for consultation with anyone else</span></span>. Not the secretary of state or the secretary of defence, nor the head of the military. <span class='card-underline'>The officer who receives the call at the Pentagon has no authority to question or challenge the order</span>. His or her duty is only to implement it. <span class='card-underline'>Thirty minutes after the president gave the instruction, the nuclear missiles would be hitting their targets. </span><span class='card-underline'>There is no way of turning them back</span>. <span class='card-underline'>Such power in the hands of a single individual would be a horrifying prospect </span><span class='card-underline'>even if it were Solomon himself</span><span class='card-underline'> whose finger was on the trigger</span>. But as Bruce Blair, a former nuclear missile launch officer, and seasoned military analyst wrote during the 2016 campaign, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Trump’s “</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>quick temper</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>, defensiveness bordering on </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>paranoia</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> and disdain for anyone who criticises him do not inspire deep confidence in his prudence</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>.”</span> What’s more, Trump is the man who said in 2015, “For me, nuclear is just the power, the devastation is very important to me,” and who bellowed from the campaign podium, “I love war”. In last year’s election campaign, the former Republican congressman Joe Scarborough reported on a briefing a foreign policy expert had given Trump. “Three times, he asked, at one point, ‘If we have them, we can’t we use them?’ … Three times, in an hour briefing, ‘Why can’t we use nuclear weapons?’” It turns out Hillary Clinton was right to warn Americans 14 months ago that, “It’s not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin.” And here we are, Trump tweet-goading the North Koreans by declaring military solutions “locked and loaded”. We need imagine no longer. <span class='card-underline'>Those who find themselves trembling at all this have spent the last few days grasping for a comfort blanket</span>. <span class='card-underline'>A favourite has been the notion that those around Trump, especially the generals current and former, will not let him unleash nuclear Armageddon</span>. <span class='card-underline'>This view holds that, yes, Trump may well be dangerously unhinged but fear not, the wiser heads of Washington will stay his hand</span>. Indeed, this strain of thinking has been visible since Trump took the oath of office. Call it the deep state fantasy. It looks to the national security apparatus, the intelligence agencies and the permanent bureaucracy, the shadow government, to step in and do the right thing. <span class='card-underline'>It hangs its hopes on a range of prospective saviours</span>. It might be the trio of former generals made up of Jim Mattis, who heads the Pentagon, John Kelly, recently drafted in as chief of staff, and HR McMaster who serves as national security adviser. Alternatively, it looks to the loose alliance hailed this week by the influential Axios website as “The Committee to Save America”, consisting not only of the generals but also the cluster of New Yorkers that includes some of Trump’s less hot-headed economic advisers, with added reinforcements from the Republican ranks in Congress. The committee’s unofficial mission: to protect “the nation from disaster”. The ultimate deep state fantasy longs for the men in the shadows not merely to restrain Trump, but remove him from office. The designated hero of this story is Robert Mueller, the former FBI director now heading what is reported to be a swift and penetrating probe into allegations of collusion with Russia as well as Trump’s wider business dealings. Mueller’s role may indeed prove to be critical. But <span class='card-underline'>the deep state fantasy itself</span>, while comforting, <span class='card-underline'>is surely a </span><span class='card-underline'>dead end for Trump’s opponents</span>. For one thing, <span class='card-underline'>events have reached an odd pass when liberals are dreaming of unelected generals thwarting an elected head of government: that used to be the fantasy of the militaristic right</span>. But <span class='card-underline'>it also relies more on hope than evidence</span>. <span class='card-underline'>All these supposedly wise heads around Trump: </span><span class='card-underline'>what restraint have they achieved so far?</span> <span class='card-underline'>Kelly was meant to impose order and discipline</span>, and <span class='card-underline'>yet we still have Trump tweeting threats that could </span><span class='card-underline'>easily be misinterpreted</span><span class='card-underline'> as the cue for war</span>. <span class='card-underline'>On North Korea, the US administration continues to send conflicting signals by the hour</span>, <span class='card-underline'>with Trump outriders like Sebastian Gorka slapping down secretary of state Rex Tillerson</span> on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Friday, creating confusion when a nuclear standoff requires calm clarity. And we cannot escape the basic fact. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>All these advisers can try to hold him back, but when it comes to it, nuclear authority is </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Trump’s and Trump’s alone</span></span>. He is the nuclear monarch. The glum truth is that <span class='card-underline'>the only people who can effectively check a democratically elected menace like Trump are </span><span class='card-underline'>other democratically elected leaders</span>. <span class='card-underline'>Ultimately it will be up to the men and women of Congress to do their constitutional duty by </span><span class='card-underline'>impeaching Trump</span> and removing him from office. <span class='card-underline'>If Republicans won’t do it, then voters need to replace them with Democrats who will,</span> by voting for a new House <span class='card-underline'>in the midterm elections</span> of November 2018.

Indeed, <span class='card-underline'>there are a couple of reasons to think many white evangelicals will react differently than their leaders who have criticized Trump</span>. Understanding evangelicals’ broader perspective on immigration can also help illuminate why this group continues to support Trump so strongly — despite recent scandals that appear to fly in the face of evangelicals’ values.1 First, <span class='card-underline'>polling on white evangelical Protestants has shown that</span> <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>they’re more likely than </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>any other religious group</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>to support </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>hardline immigration policies</span></span> and to have negative views of immigrants overall. A recent survey by the Pew Research Center found that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>70 percent</span></span> <span class='card-underline'>of white evangelical Protestants </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>are in favor of </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>expanding the border wall</span></span> between the U.S. and Mexico, compared with only around half of white mainline Protestants and white Catholics and much lower shares of other religious groups. Another Pew survey, conducted last year, found <span class='card-underline'>that while majorities of nearly every religious group agree that immigrants strengthen our country, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>white evangelical Protestants are</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>more divided</span>, <span class='card-underline'>with a plurality</span> (44 percent) <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>saying that immigrants are a burden</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. </span>These findings line up with results from other surveys too, like a 2017 poll from the Public Religion Research Institute that found that white evangelical Protestants were the only religious group in which a majority (57 percent) said they’re bothered when they encounter immigrants who don’t speak English. They were also the likeliest to say that they have little or nothing in common with immigrants.

In an attempt to discourage this, the Trump administration has been prosecuting the parents immediately, which means separating parents from their children. Do you support or oppose this policy?” As my colleague Dara Lind notes, this characterizes most of the reason for family separation, though some families seeking asylum legally at ports of entry have also been separated. Sixty-six percent of voters — including <span class='card-underline'>91 percent of Democrats</span> and 68 percent of independents — <span class='card-underline'>told Quinnipiac they opposed the policy</span>. Whites with college degrees were likelier than non-college whites to oppose the policy, and young people of all races were likelier to oppose it than old people. Women were likelier to oppose the policy than men, and black and Hispanic Americans were more likely to oppose it than whites (though a large majority of whites still oppose the policy). <span class='card-underline'>But </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>by a </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>large, 20-point</span></span> (55 percent to 35 percent) <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>margin</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Republicans supported the policy</span></span>: <span class='card-underline'>A poll conducted by Ipsos exclusively for the Daily Beast found similar results</span>. Ipsos asked respondents if they agreed with this statement: “It is appropriate to separate undocumented immigrant parents from their children when they cross the border in order to discourage others from crossing the border illegally.” The wording is slightly different from the Quinnipiac poll, foregrounding the deterrence rationale the Trump administration has used to defend the policy. Fifty-five percent of respondents stated they disagreed (42 percent “strongly” disagreed), while 27 percent agreed. As in the Quinnipiac poll, women and nonwhite people were likelier to disagree with the policy; unlike the Quinnipiac poll, differences based on education were minimal, and 18- to 34-year-olds and 35- to 54-year-olds had similar opinions. (People 55 and up were likelier to support the policy.) And as in the Quinnipiac poll, <span class='card-underline'>more Republicans approved of the policy than not</span> (46 percent to 32 percent). Note that unlike the Quinnipiac poll, the Ipsos poll found only a plurality of Republicans supporting family separation, not a majority. Chris Warshaw, a political scientist at George Washington University, notes that both the Quinnipiac and Ipsos polling suggests the policy is less popular than any major policy proposal of recent American history, including the extremely unpopular Obamacare repeal bills of last summer: [tweet omitted] Nonetheless, the polls find that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Trump’s</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>core Republican base supports family separation</span></span>. But when interpreting party-based polling, one should keep in mind the finding by Emory political scientists Pablo Montagnes, Zachary Peskowitz, and Joshua McCrain that Trump’s unpopularity has coincided with fewer people identifying as Republicans. That could mean that Republicans who disagree with Trump, and in particular his immigration policies, are likelier to identify as independents rather than Republicans now, which in turn artificially inflates support for Trump among self-identified Republicans.

It would mean rejecting their own values.” https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/trump-s-core-supporters-won-t-reject-him-it-would-ncna846456)</p><p>Political experience and logic tell us that, at some point, Donald Trump's supporters should become overwhelmed by the mounting evidence of his failures and broken promises — as Steve Bannon reportedly was over the inclusion of a path to citizenship for DREAMers in the State of the Union — and retreat. <span class='card-underline'>But the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>back of the Trump base is not likely to break any time soon, because Trump’s supporters aren’t beholden to politics or logic</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>. </span><span class='card-underline'>Instead, they are creatures of a group psychology dynamic more commonly seen in religious and fraternal organizations. In the “communion mode” authority structure</span><span class='card-underline'>,</span> described by Andrew Gray, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>people's recognition of legitimate authority is "based on an appeal to common values and creeds</span></span><span class='card-underline'>."</span> "In this mode," added Gray, "<span class='card-underline'>the legitimacy for actions lies in consistency with the understandings, protocols, and guiding values of shared frames of reference.</span>” Compare that to the contractual mode, which is based an agreement that sets out obligations and rewards, or “command mode,” which Gray said, "is based on the rule of law emanating from a sovereign body and delivered through a scalar chain of superior and subordinate authority." Communion governance structures rely on regular in-person meetings, call and response rituals (witness the continued usefulness of "Lock her up!" chants at Trump rallies, despite Hillary Clinton's 2016 loss) and faith in shared values and experiences. <span class='card-underline'>Groups built around communion authority are tightly connected and very strong in part because, </span><span class='card-underline'>research shows</span><span class='card-underline'>, they display “homophily and parochialism directed to those outside the group.”</span> (That is a scholarly way of saying that those in communion groups tend to associate and bond with people that are similar to themselves and view those who are not with suspicion and hostility.) When Trump said he was going to build the wall, he was reflecting a shared value of opposition to immigration, or anti-Hispanic bias or frustration with paralysis on immigration policy (or all three). Significantly, researchers have also found thatreligious communion authority followers make contributions as a show of their values rather than to affect any consequence<span class='card-highlight'>.</span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>That’s key to understanding Trump’s base because it means that contributions to the cause — whether money, posting on social media or voting — were unlikely to be influenced by whether Trump could actually deliver on his promises</span></span>. And it explains why political arguments about whether the wall will really get built (Trump has admitted that it doesn't need to be a full scale wall), whether Mexico is going to pay for it (they won't, and Trump knows it) or whether he's brought coal jobs back (he didn't) did not, do not and will not matter to Trump supporters. Even though Trump promised a wall for which Mexico would pay and coal jobs, among other broken promises, his supporters did not invest in his campaign to get those specific things. <span class='card-underline'>When Trump said he was going to build that wall, he was reflecting a shared value of opposition to immigration, or anti-Hispanic bias or frustration with paralysis on immigration policy (or all three</span><span class='card-underline'>)</span>. To those in this communion structure, Trump’s seriousness about their shared values — that he believes them too — is all that matters. Moreover, according to philanthropy experts, for those in communion structures, a belief that the group’s values are under threat or assault by larger, stronger forces dramatically increases followers' commitment. Therefore, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the act of critics pointing out Trump’s failures could strengthen his standing if drawing attention to those failures are seen as persecution by outside forces</span></span> (such as a “deep state” or a “fake news media”). Perhaps most importantly, as communion followers, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>those in the Trump base are likely to see attacks on him as attacks on them personally</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, because they recognize Trump as a values leader, not a political one.</span> <span class='card-underline'>Opposition to him is opposition to those values — their values</span>. So, when reporters ask, “Do you still support Trump?” they hear, “Do you still support your own values?” Research supports that the bonds between communion group members are stronger than those between followers and a leader<span class='card-highlight'>.</span> It is important, therefore, to view Trump as distinct from the values of the group. A leader may be transitional, but the values tend to be more rigid. <span class='card-underline'>Therefore, inroads to Trump’s base are more likely to be successful if they avoid the values or symbols of the supporters, and find ways to target Trump for betraying them</span>. <span class='card-underline'>They recognize his legitimacy and follow him not because of who he is or what he does, but because of what they think he believes</span> — and what they think that says about them. Because the values outweigh the leaders, when communion followers no longer see their values reflected by a communion leader, they become receptive to finding a new one. Since people's acceptance of communion authority relies on consistency with shared values, demonstrating that Trump no longer does (or never did) share the values of his followers in faith, not practice would be pivotal. Similarly, the emergence of other leaders that more passionately reflect shared values would cleave Trump from his base. If, for example, someone stepped forward to say Trump is not hard enough on immigrants, terrorists or trade, that person might pull supporters away from Trump and into their orbit. Still, owing to the group’s insularity and resistance to outside criticism, any values-based replacements for Trump must come from within the structure, not outside. To work, the followers must believe the leader believes in the shared value more than Trump. And even under such scenario, it’s unlikely that such a replacement leader could take over the Trump base as much as fragment it. No further treks to Trump Country are needed to understand why Trump’s base remains unshaken. They recognize his legitimacy and follow him not because of who he is or what he does, but because of what they think he believes — and what they think that says about them.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Immigration is central to the base – more important than healthcare</div><div class='cite'>Harwood, 17 (John Harwood needs quals. “Trump's core voters could suffer most under GOP health bill, but they may not punish him for it”.

He won college-educated white voters by a four-point margin over Hillary Clinton, according to exit polls. But his real victory was among members of the white working class: Twice as many of these voters cast their ballots for the president as for Clinton. In the wake of Trump’s surprise win, some journalists, scholars, and political strategists argued that economic anxiety drove these Americans to Trump. But new analysis of post-election survey data conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute and The Atlantic found something different: <span class='card-underline'>Evidence suggests financially troubled voters in the white working class were more likely to prefer Clinton over Trump.</span> Besides partisan affiliation, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>it was cultural anxiety</span></span>—feeling like a stranger in America, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>supporting the deportation of immigrants</span></span><span class='card-underline'>,</span> and hesitating about educational investment—<span class='card-underline'>that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>best predicted support for Trump</span></span>. This data adds to the public’s mosaic-like understanding of the 2016 election. It suggests Trump’s most powerful message, at least among some Americans, was about defending the country’s putative culture. Because this message seems to have resonated so deeply with voters, Trump’s policies, speeches, and eventual reelection may depend on their perception of how well he fulfills it. In September and October 2016, PRRI and The Atlantic surveyed American voters about how they were feeling about politics. Researchers specifically focused on white, working-class voters—people without college degrees or salaried jobs. This group accounts for one-third of American adults. They make up a bigger share of the population in the Midwest than they do in any other region, and more than half of rural Americans are part of the white working class. As it turned out, this would become one of the most decisive groups of voters in the election. In November, researchers returned to this group to see how its members had voted and get a sense of why. They found that 64 percent of these voters had chosen Trump, while only 32 percent chose Clinton. While white, non-college-educated voters tend to prefer Republicans, Trump won them by a larger margin than any presidential candidate since 1980, according to the Pew Research Center. Partisan identification strongly predicted how white, working-class people would vote. Self-described Republicans were 11 times more likely than their non-Republican peers to choose Trump. Researchers found that partisanship is most pronounced among the young: Among white working-class Americans under 30, 57 percent identified as Republican or Republican-leaning, compared to 29 percent who identified as Democratic or Democratic-leaning. By comparison, only slightly more than half of seniors 65 and over were Republicans or Republican-leaning, compared to over one-third who were Democrats or Democratic-leaning. It may not be surprising that Republicans vote Republican. But the analysis also isolated a handful of other factors that drove white working-class voters—ones that defy post-election tropes. Controlling for other demographic variables, three <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>factors stood out as strong independent predictors of how white working-class people would vote</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The first was anxiety about cultural change. Sixty-eight percent of white working-class voters said the American way of life needs to be protected from foreign influence</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. </span>And nearly half agreed with the statement, “things have changed so much that I often feel like a stranger in my own country.” Together, these variables were strong indictors of support for Trump: <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>79 percent of white working-class voters who had these anxieties chose Trump</span></span>, while only 43 percent of white working-class voters who did not share one or both of these fears cast their vote the same way. <span class='card-underline'>The second factor was immigration.</span> Contrary to popular narratives, only a small portion—just <span class='card-underline'>27 percent—of white working-class voters said they favor a policy of identifying and deporting immigrants who are in the country illegally</span>. <span class='card-underline'>Among the people who did share this belief, Trump was wildly popular: 87 percent of them supported the president in the 2016 election</span>. Finally, 54 percent of white working-class Americans said investing in college education is a risky gamble, including 61 percent of white working-class men. White working-class voters who held this belief were almost twice as likely as their peers to support Trump. “The enduring narrative of the American dream is that if you study and get a college education and work hard, you can get ahead,” said Robert P. Jones, the CEO of PRRI. “The survey shows that many white working-class Americans, especially men, no longer see that path available to them. … It is this sense of economic fatalism, more than just economic hardship, that was the decisive factor in support for Trump among white working-class voters.” While the analysis pointed to some interesting patterns around economic status, more research is needed to confirm them. The findings contrast with much of the coverage of the election: People who said their finances are only in fair or poor shape were nearly twice as likely to support Clinton compared to those who feel more economically secure. Although demographic factors like gender, age, geographic region, and religion weren’t statistically significant predictors of who voted for Trump, some of the other information gathered in the survey offers a portrait of how white working-class Americans feel about their status in the world. Nearly two-thirds of the white working class say American culture has gotten worse since the 1950s. Sixty-eight percent say the U.S. is in danger of losing its identity, and <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>62 percent say America’s growing number of immigrants threaten the country’s culture</span></span>. More than half say discrimination against whites has become just as problematic as discrimination against minorities. This analysis provides only a surface look at the concerns and anxieties of America’s white working class. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Polling</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is</span></span> a notoriously clumsy instrument for understanding people’s lives, and provides only a sketch of who they are. But it’s <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>useful for debunking myths and narratives—particularly the ubiquitous idea that economic anxiety drove white working-class voters to support Trump.</span></span> When these voters hear messages from their president, they’re listening with ears attuned to cultural change and anxiety about America’s multicultural future. It would be a mistake to use this insight to create yet another caricature of the Trump voter. But perhaps it will complicate the stereotypes about destitute factory landscapes and poor folks who had nowhere to turn but right.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Econ doesn’t thump – Immigration is the key voting issue for Republicans </div><div class='cite'>Caspani 7/5</div><div class='card-body'><p>(Maria Caspani is a digital editor at Reuters News Agency.

Bush. The president has come under harsh criticism since Monday’s summit with the Russian leader. In the post-meeting press conference, Trump appeared to endorse Putin’s denial of Russian election meddling over the conclusions of U.S. intelligence agencies. On Tuesday, Trump said he misspoke. <span class='card-underline'>Fagen told CNBC that while there has been very strong </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>criticism from Republican senators, it has been from those who have been critical of the president</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> “We need to see the full body of the Senate, particularly, and some leaders in the House, they would need to be much more critical, and the language they use would need to be stronger,” she said on “Power Lunch” Tuesday. Plus, one or two very senior White House officials would need to resign for his base to be swayed, added Fagen, a CNBC contributor. In responding to the widespread criticism on Tuesday, Trump said, "I accept our intelligence community's conclusion that Russia's meddling in the 2016 election took place." He then added: "Could be other people also. A lot of people out there. But there was no collusion." The president said he misspoke in Monday’s press conference. "My people came to me, [Director of National Intelligence] Dan Coates came to me and some others, they said they think it's Russia. I have President Putin. He just said it's not Russia," Trump said Monday. "I will say this: I don't see any reason why it would be." However, Trump said he meant to say he didn't see "any reason why it wouldn't be Russia." He also repeatedly praised intelligence agencies on Tuesday. "I have a faith, full faith, in our intelligence agencies. I have full faith and support for America's great intelligence agencies, always have," he said. Fagen said Trump should have said those words while standing next to Putin, but she believes his remarks on Tuesday will soothe the criticism. “<span class='card-underline'>The </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>criticism has been sharp</span></span><span class='card-underline'> in a few corners </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>but not sharp enough to see widespread defections</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>to force people to resign, the things that would be required for this to be a tipping point, at least in his foreign policy outlook</span></span><span class='card-underline'>,</span>” she said. Among those who slammed the president on Monday was Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who called the press conference "one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory." Former CIA director John Brennan said in a tweet that the press conference was "nothing short of treasonous." </p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Helsinki hasn’t hurt Trump – still retains his base and same approval rating</div><div class='cite'>Levitz 7/19</div><div class='card-body'><p>(Eric Levitz is a political writer at New York Magazine.

July 19, 2018. “Polls: GOP Voters Think Trump’s Putin Summit Went Great” http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/07/polls-most-voters-disapproved-of-trumps-putin-summit.html)</p><p>On Monday, the president of the United States blamed American law enforcement for souring U.S.-Russia relations; suggested that the Kremlin is more trustworthy than the CIA; and voiced approval for allowing FSB agents to interrogate Americans who’ve run afoul of Moscow — all while Vladimir Putin smirked from a podium a few feet to his left. For many of Donald Trump’s normally sycophantic surrogates, this sorry spectacle was a gaffe too far. It was one thing for Trump to defend neo-Nazis, or psychologically torture masses of migrant children, or demand the FBI comport itself as his personal detective agency. But to stand beside an avowed opponent of U.S. hegemony — and apologize for America? “Disgusting,” declared Fox Business anchor Neil Cavuto. “The most serious mistake of his presidency,” Newt Gingrich declared. The Senate’s nominally anti-Trump Republicans turned their empty rhetorical denunciations up to 11. Even die-hard Trumpists like Tom Cotton felt compelled to offer implicit criticism. For once, conservative elites had certified that mainstream outrage at Trump’s conduct was not, in fact, “fake news.” <span class='card-underline'>This raised the possibility that the president’s bizarre performance in Helsinki might actually change public opinion, and with it, the terrain of the battle for House control. As </span><span class='card-underline'>RealClearPolitics’ Sean Trende</span><span class='card-underline'> noted, if Trump’s approval dipped back below 40 percent — where it had been through much of the fall — precedent would predict a Democratic “wave” this November. But that doesn’t appear to be happening. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Trump’s job approval has not </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>dropped significantly</span></span> in the first surveys taken since the Helsinki summit. And two polls released Thursday explain why: While a large majority of Democrats and independents disapproved of Trump’s performance, <span class='card-underline'>most Republican </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>voters now believe that it’s actually </span></span><span class='card-underline'>cool and </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>good for an American president to say he trusts a former KGB agent </span></span><span class='card-underline'>more than the FBI.</span> An Axios/SurveyMonkey poll finds that 79 percent of Republicans approved of Trump’s handling of the summit, while 91 percent of Democrats and 62 percent of independents disagreed. In total, <span class='card-underline'>that puts overall disapproval at 58 percent, and approval at 40</span>. A CBS News survey, meanwhile, produces largely similar results (for whatever reason, a lot more respondents chose “I don’t know” in the network’s survey than did in Axios’s): <span class='card-underline'>68 percent of Republicans told the network that Trump did a good job in Helsinki</span>, 83 percent of Democrats and 53 percent of independents said he did a bad one. These are not good poll numbers. In 2016, Trump scraped together an Electoral College victory on the strength of 80,000 well-placed votes. Since then, his approval rating has plummeted across the Rust Belt.Now, at a time of historically low unemployment, a majority of voters disapprove of Trump’s job performance in the states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Ohio. In this context, <span class='card-underline'>the fact that</span> <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the president is retaining most of his base</span></span> — while alienating most independent voters — is not good news for his reelection prospects. It <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is</span></span>, however, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>good enough to keep the threat of significant intraparty criticism</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>(let alone, impeachment) <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>at bay</span></span>. After Trump did three-quarters of an about-face on Putin — claiming, absurdly, that he had intended to say the opposite of what he’d actually said about Russian involvement in the 2016 election — Republican lawmakers rallied back to his side. And, thanks to Republican gerrymandering, and the higher turnout rates of the elderly<span class='card-underline'>, </span><span class='card-underline'>if Trump can keep his approval rating above 40 percent, he just might keep the House in GOP hands</span>. <span class='card-underline'>For the moment, it doesn’t look like Helsinki was any kind of “turning point.” </span>Trump was about as historically unpopular before the summit, as he is now, days after. In the short term, the vast disparity between how Republican voters see the world — and how the rest of the electorate does — might qualify as good news for GOP incumbents.

Over the past month, <span class='card-underline'>each piece of this scenario has begun to seem a tad more likely — except, that is, for the “doesn’t get us all killed” bit. </span>Of course, Donald Trump is (almost certainly) not going to literally end all human life. But in recent weeks<span class='card-underline'>, many of the downside risks of his election — a mass-casualty war, irreparable diplomatic blunder, or constitutional crisis — </span><span class='card-underline'>have become more plausible than ever before</span>. Assuming we avoid total catastrophe, America is poised to make a speedy recovery from its ill-advised experiment with kakistocracy. But there are (at least) four reasons why that assumption has never been less safe: <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>1) The “adults” in the West Wing have never had less influence over the president</span></span>. The most harrowing development in presidential politics over the past month (the one that exacerbates all of the others) is that Donald <span class='card-underline'>Trump finally lost his humility</span>. That may sound absurd, like saying Trump “finally” lost his tail, or some other appendage that the president was clearly born without, or else separated from in early childhood. But the reality is that, <span class='card-underline'>until recently, Trump approached his duties with a modicum of modesty</span>. Awed by the awesome responsibilities of his new office, <span class='card-underline'>Trump spent much of last year deferring to the expertise of his advisers. He let the Republican Establishment dictate his legislative agenda and most of his Cabinet, and allowed the putative “adults” in the West Wing to overrule his instincts on the Iran deal, trade policy, and a variety of other matters</span>. Of course, this forbearance was never strong enough to prevent the man from firing off incendiary tweets, praising white nationalists, canceling climate deals, or obstructing a little justice. But it was, nevertheless, sufficient to prevent Trump from translating his most belligerent rhetoric about foreign policy and the Mueller investigation into action. Now, however, <span class='card-underline'>Trump has finally shaken off his first-year jitters — and is ready to appoint himself the “adult” in every room</span>. As the New York Times reports: <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>A dozen people close to Mr. Trump or the White House, including current</span></span> and <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>former</span></span> aides and longtime friends, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>described him as newly emboldened</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>to say what he really feels and to ignore the cautions of those around him</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. </span>… [I]n his first year in the White House, according to his friends, he found himself feeling tentative and anxious, intimidated by the role of president, a fact that he never openly admitted but that they could sense, people close to the president said … They say Mr. Trump now feels he doesn’t need the expertise of Mr. Kelly, Mr. Cohn or Rex W. Tillerson, the former Exxon Mobil executive he made secretary of state. <span class='card-underline'>If he once suspected they were smarter or better equipped to lead the country and protect his presidency, he doesn’t believe that now. The president’s new mind-set is readily apparent</span>. Over the past two weeks, <span class='card-underline'>Trump has unilaterally announced steep tariffs</span> on steel and aluminum imports to the United States; <span class='card-underline'>ousted the “globalist” director of his National Economic Council</span>; agreed to an unprecedented face-to-face meeting with the leader of North Korea; <span class='card-underline'>fired his secretary of State</span> over Twitter; orchestrated the (politically motivated) firing of deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe; and disparaged Robert Mueller’s investigation — by name — for the first time ever. In most, if not all, of these cases, <span class='card-underline'>the president</span> either <span class='card-underline'>acted over the objections of senior advisers, or without bothering to consult them at all. </span><span class='card-underline'>The election of an emotionally volatile reality star — with authoritarian instincts, an insatiable ego</span>, <span class='card-underline'>a capacious ignorance of American civics and geopolitics, and an implacable aversion to reading multi-page documents — led many a commentator to seek solace in the thought that Trump wouldn’t really be in charge</span>. Precisely because he was so ignorant of — and uninterested in — governance, the new president would delegate critical decisions to his team of decorated generals, veteran GOP operatives, and corporate titans. He would handle the tweets, speeches, and petty graft; they’d handle the policy. <span class='card-underline'>Trump’s first 14 months produced plenty of evidence to support this hypothesis. But the past few weeks have fatally undermined it.</span> The White House isn’t preparing for face-to-face talks with North Korea because James Mattis decided that was a good idea; or drafting $60 billion worth of tariffs against China because that’s what the GOP Establishment wanted. These things are happening solely because Trump decided to make them happen. That maniac on Twitter really is the president of the United States. And as more and more “adults” exit the West Wing — and it becomes more and more difficult to find normal, competent people willing to take their places — the chances of a return to last year’s “normalcy” grow ever more remote. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>2) Trump’s path to a war with North Korea has never been easier to envision</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>.</span> <span class='card-underline'>The fact that Donald </span><span class='card-underline'>Trump’s gut instincts are now governing the White House</span><span class='card-underline'> would be alarming in just about any context</span>. But in the present one, it is especially so. Two weeks ago, Trump accepted (on a whim) Kim Jong-un’s invitation for a face-to-face meeting. At first, criticism of this decision focused on the prospect that our prodigiously ignorant, easily flattered commander-in-chief would get suckered into a lopsided peace deal. But Victor Cha — Trump’s tentative pick for ambassador to South Korea, who (reportedly) lost that gig for his off-putting opposition to a preemptive strike on Pyongyang — highlighted a more ominous possibility in an op-ed for the New York Times: Everyone should be aware that this dramatic act of diplomacy by these two unusual leaders, who love flair and drama, may also take us closer to war. Failed negotiations at the summit level leave all parties with no other recourse for diplomacy. In which case, as Mr. Trump has said, we really will have “run out of road” on North Korea. The likelihood of this nightmare scenario increased significantly, last week, when Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and (reportedly) began seriously considering making John Bolton his next national security adviser. For his many, many faults, Tillerson was nevertheless one of the administration’s staunchest defenders of the Iran nuclear agreement — and among its most ardent opponents of a belligerent approach to North Korea. By contrast, his replacement — outgoing CIA director Mike Pompeo — was the only senior White House official who encouraged Trump to decertify the Iran deal, even as his colleagues in the intelligence agencies affirmed Tehran’s compliance with the agreement. Trump’s summit with Kim is tentatively scheduled for May. That same month, the president will need to either reaffirm Iran’s compliance with the agreement — or else withdraw the United States from the deal. The president (reportedly) told Benjamin Netanyahu that he intends to pick door No.2. Pompeo’s promotion increases the probability that Trump will keep that pledge. And if the president does, in fact, reaffirm the emptiness of America’s promises to rogue regimes – right before sitting down across from Kim – then North Korea would have to be an irrational actor to take him up on any denuclearization deal. It is true that, to this point, Defense Secretary James <span class='card-underline'>Mattis</span> and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster have <span class='card-underline'>kept Trump from blowing up the Iran agreement</span>. And the fact that nullifying that deal would compromise diplomatic efforts with North Korea surely won’t escape those officials. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>But Mattis lost the internal fight over tariffs</span></span>, and also, presumably, over Tillerson. Meanwhile, McMaster may be on his way out of the administration — and one of the top candidates to replace him is an Iran hawk who is publicly rooting for diplomacy with North Korea to fail. “How do you know the North Koreans are lying? Because their lips are moving,” John Bolton explained to Fox News last week. The former U.N. ambassador went on to argue that Trump’s meeting with Kim Jong-un was a positive development — because, as Cha had warned, it could accelerate the breakdown of diplomacy and the onset of military action to combat the North Korean threat. (A recent Pentagon simulation projected that a nonnuclear war between the United States and North Korea would come with a daily death toll of 20,000 in South Korea.) If recent rumors prove true, Bolton will be the highest-ranking national-security official in the White House come May. <span class='card-underline'>3) Trump has never had a stronger incentive to undermine rule of law in the United States</span>. In recent weeks, the special counsel has subpoenaed documents from the Trump Organization, sought an interview with the president himself, secured the cooperation of various Trump campaign aides and associates, and scrutinized the business dealings of the president’s son-in-law. Throughout his presidency, <span class='card-underline'>Trump has displayed an aversion to the concept of “rule of law</span>.” <span class='card-underline'>He has argued repeatedly that he believes the Justice Department’s first responsibility is to protect him from legal harm. Now, he has more cause for indulging this authoritarian impulse than ever before</span>. And indulging it, he is. Late Friday night, Jeff Sessions fired Andrew McCabe — just 26 hours before the G-man was set to qualify for his pension. McCabe immediately alleged that he’d been fired for crass political reasons — Trump was trying to discredit him as part of a broader attempt to obstruct and delegitimize the special counsel’s investigation. Trump promptly confirmed this charge. In a tweet celebrating McCabe’s firing, the president did not refer to any findings from the inspector general’s report that had officially triggered the deputy FBI director’s ouster, opting instead to denounce McCabe for his ties to James Comey, and complicity in “the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!” The president proceeded to publicly assail the Mueller probe, arguing that it was launched on the basis of a “Fake Dossier” (which is indisputably untrue) and that the investigative team leading it includes “Zero Republicans” (Robert Mueller is a Republican). Meanwhile, one of Trump’s lawyers called for the investigation to be shut down. Ultimately, these attacks are less alarming for their immediate effects, than for the signal that they send to the rest of federal law enforcement. Andrew McCabe is going to be fine. He has a range of options for recovering his pension, and (surely) for selling his tell-all book. And, as of this writing, the Mueller probe is still alive and kicking — in no small part because shutting down the investigation would be enormously difficult and costly for the president. Beyond the complex series of personnel changes required to dispatch Mueller and his team, the high-profile nature of the investigation ensures that its untimely death would result in a blizzard of politically damaging leaks. Still, as Vox’s Matt Yglesias writes: Part of the normal scandal aversion of a normal administration is that middle managers in the federal bureaucracy who sincerely support the president will try not to create a scandal. So it’s not just that Obama would not personally reach down into an investigation and meddle for political purposes, but a passionate Obama fan who also happens to run an Environmental Protection Agency field office wouldn’t do it either. The top leadership sets a tone, and while the tone isn’t universally followed, it does exert a big influence on people’s practical behavior. <span class='card-underline'>Trump</span>, by contrast, has sent a clear signal in the opposite direction — he <span class='card-underline'>wants federal public servants</span>, up to and including FBI special agents, <span class='card-underline'>to act like they are his personal employees. </span>That doesn’t mean they’ll all do it — most of them won’t. But <span class='card-underline'>some of them will</span>. The actual political appointees at every agency know what’s expected of them, and to the extent that there are ambitious and career-minded Trump fans scattered throughout the government — which is surely the case at the federal police agencies, if not the regulatory ones — they know that excessive service of Trump’s personal interests will be rewarded rather than punished. <span class='card-underline'>If Donald Trump really puts his mind to weaponizing federal agencies, he could inflict a tremendous amount of damage on our democracy</span>. Thanks to the the War on Terror (and Barack Obama), Trump has inherited the legal authority to indefinitely detain anyone his administration deems a suspected terrorist or to assassinate Americans overseas without trial — and the technological wherewithal to spy on his political enemies, should he find or cultivate friendly renegades within the intelligence community. Separately, his administration’s responsibilities for administering the 2020 census and safeguarding the security of our elections provide significant opportunities for undermining democratic rule, should Trump and his allies become more adept at corrupting the federal bureaucracy. To this point, the strongest protection against such nightmare scenarios has been Trump’s dearth of ambition. No one ever became a successful dictator by watching eight hours of cable news each day, and taking a golf vacation nearly every weekend. But the Mueller probe is forcing the president (and his advisers) to think deeply about how the “deep state” can be co-opted. And <span class='card-underline'>as Trump has grown more self-confident, he’s begun tackling that problem with more energy and creativity</span>. It remains difficult to believe that Trump has the wherewithal to outmaneuver senior civil servants throughout the Executive branch. But it’s a bit less difficult now than it was a few weeks ago; and it’s quite easy to imagine that the Democratic Party’s 2020 nominee will campaign while under some form of federal investigation. <span class='card-underline'>4) It’s never been clearer that Congressional Republicans are unwilling to act as a check on Trump’s worst impulses.</span> <span class='card-underline'>Congressional Republicans have been abetting Trump’s corruption from the earliest days of his administration</span>. But at various points in the president’s first year, GOP lawmakers signaled that there was an outer limit to their sycophancy. Last summer, as Trump publicly berated his attorney general for recusing himself from the FBI’s Russia investigation, Mitch McConnell kept the Senate formally in session through its August vacation to prevent the president from unilaterally replacing Jeff Sessions through a recess appointment. That same month, North Carolina Republican Thom Tillis spearheaded a Senate bill designed to immunize Mueller’s probe against a White House attack. At the time, some pundits took these moves as a sign that Republicans would turn more forcefully against the president once they’d secured their tax cuts and/or, once his atrocious approval ratings began weighing on the party’s 2018 prospects. But the very opposite happened. In recent weeks, <span class='card-underline'>as Democrats racked up improbable special-election victories</span>, and the White House’s scandals continued to metastasize, <span class='card-underline'>Republicans grew even more craven in their fealty to the president</span><span class='card-underline'>. The House Intelligence Committee progressed from shielding the president from federal investigators to attacking those investigators on his behalf</span>: In February, the committee’s Republicans released a memo, which purported to demonstrate that the FBI had used opposition research funded by Hillary Clinton to obtain a surveillance warrant of Trump aide Carter Page, one month before the 2016 election — without disclosing the political motivations behind said research to the relevant authorities. Republican lawmakers hyped these and related claims, with Senator Ron Johnson going so far as to announce that a “secret society” of anti-Trump Democrats was fomenting “corruption of the highest levels of the FBI.” But Nunes’s memo did not actually demonstrate anything of that kind, while its most concrete allegations of FBI malfeasance were subsequently proven false. And yet, four GOP senators nevertheless asked the Justice Department last week to appoint a second special counsel to investigate the FBI’s investigation into Russia. More remarkably, <span class='card-underline'>Republicans aren’t just abetting Trump’s attacks on the rule of law — they’re even acquiescing to his assaults on their donors’ economic interests</span>: After Trump unveiled his steel tariffs earlier this month, Arizona senator Jeff Flake put together legislation nullifying the president’s authority to take such trade actions without congressional consent — and the Senate GOP leadership promptly disavowed the measure. Some pundits retain hope that the congressional GOP has a breaking point — that, should Trump cross a certain line, Republicans would suddenly find it in their political interest to distance themselves from him. This may be the case. But there’s reason to think that the incentive for Republican lawmakers to stick by Trump is actually growing stronger as his administration becomes more scandal-ridden.<span class='card-underline'> In an era of hyperpolarization, most midterm elections are won or lost on turnout</span>. Which means that, <span class='card-underline'>the more energized the other side’s base becomes, the more critical it is for you to retain the enthusiasm of your core constituency</span>. We first glimpsed the perverse incentives that this dynamic can create last spring, when some moderate Republicans in the House voted for a deeply unpopular health-care bill precisely because it generated such passionate opposition. As Politico reported, “As GOP leaders scrambled to bring the last holdouts aboard in recent days, they made the argument that the liberal base is already on fire … That means Republicans could ill afford to fall short on their health-care promise and risk depressing their own turnout.” <span class='card-underline'>Republican strategists are now using this exact same argument to caution GOP lawmakers against distancing themselves from Trump</span>. And, in this case, they’re almost certainly right. Matters might be different had Republicans spent the past 14 months passing popular legislation and building a base of support independent from Trump’s. But they did no such thing.

When they were still a part of the Soviet Union, the upstream republics—Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan—which have an abundance of water, would release some from their reservoirs in the spring and summer to generate electricity and nourish crops both on their own land and in the downstream republics, which would return the favor by providing gas and coal each winter. But since the dissolution of the Soviet Union over a quarter century ago, that system has collapsed. Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan now face constant blackouts and hope to build giant dams to provide for their energy needs. Kyrgyzstan completed its Kambarata-2 power station in 2010 and is building a second one, Kambarata-1, with the help of Russia. Although he doesn’t have the funds, Tajik President Emomali Rahmon often speaks zealously about his mission to build a 335-meter dam, Rogun, which has the potential to turn his impoverished statelet into a powerbroker. But there is one glaring issue: the region’s glaciers, the source of huge and once predictable water supplies, are melting at record rates. Every year, it loses about as much water as consumed by a country the size of Switzerland. And the dams stand to limit water supply even further for the downstream countries. This has set them on edge. Along the disputed frontiers of the Fergana Valley, which is spread out over three of the countries, locals bicker with their neighbors over irrigation water. These small spats quickly escalate.

But it placed tight limits on the numbers of permanent-resident visas for those who wanted to stay, so the lines grew longer and longer. My research team at Duke, Harvard and NYU documented that there were, as of October 2006, more than a million skilled workers in “immigration limbo” in the U.S., with only 120,000 green cards being made available every year for their work categories. Ten years later, I estimate <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the number of skilled workers in limbo is roughly 1.5 million</span></span>.

That is also why the proportion of immigrant-founded start-ups in Silicon Valley fell from 52% in 2005 to 44% in 2012 and is probably even lower today.</p><p>It is in this context that the Obama administration announced its last-ditch effort to reverse the tide. On Aug. 26, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposed a rule to allow foreign entrepreneurs to enter or remain in the U.S. and work at qualifying start-ups. This uses the parole authority under which the president, through DHS, can permit certain individuals to temporarily stay in the U.S.</p><p>But the president’s immigration authority is very limited, and this is a very short-term and very constrained fix. The start-up entity must have been formed within the three years before an application for entrepreneurial parole; the entrepreneurs must own at least 15% of the entity; only three foreigners can be employed by the start-up; and the applicant must prove that the start-up has “substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation” by receiving investments of capital totaling $345,000 or more from established U.S. investors with a history of substantial investment in successful start-up entities or at least $100,000 in grants or awards from local, state or federal government

Partition bestowed India an advantage, as the headwaters were located in its territory, leaving Pakistan exposed to India’s physical capacity to cut off vital irrigation water. As a result, India kept limiting Pakistan’s share of water. Seeing the possibility of another conflict between the two neighbors, the international community plunged in to fix the Indo-Pak water crisis. With the help of the World Bank, both states eventually agreed to the Indus Water Treaty (IWT) in 1960. The IWT enabled Pakistan and India to equally share and utilize water coming from the Himalayan Mountains. The treaty is exemplary since it has survived dozens of Indo-Pak military skirmishes, hostile political atmospheres, and diplomatic hiccups. What has gone so wrong that now India is flexing its muscles to terminate the treaty, or at least change it to increase Indian benefits? Is it mere electoral rhetoric ahead of the state elections in Indian Punjab that motivated Modi to threaten IWT by saying “The government will do everything to give enough water to our farmers”?

Under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, Pakistan has control over the Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab Rivers, and India manages the Sutlej, Beas, and Ravi rivers until they cross into Pakistan and all merge into the Indus River. The treaty was established in part because of conflicts over water between the two countries following independence in 1947, including an Indian decision in 1948 to block some of the water flowing into Pakistan during the first India-Pakistan war over Kashmir. As water demand in both countries has grown to meet the needs of rapidly growing populations and increased agriculture and industrial use, large hydroelectric dams have been constructed, and renewed disputes are testing the Indus Waters Treaty. A 2011 United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee report assessed that “<span class='card-underline'>water may prove to be a source of instability in South Asia [as] new demands for the use of the river flows from irrigation and hydroelectric power are fueling tensions between India and Pakistan. </span>A breakdown in the [Indus Water] treaty’s utility in resolving <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>water conflicts could have serious ramifications for regional stability</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.” The report concluded grimly that “the United States cannot expect this region to continue to avoid ‘water wars’ in perpetuity.” </span>This is not a new concern. As long ago as 2002, Indian Water Resources Minister Bijoya Chakroborty threatened, “If we decide to scrap the Indus Water Treaty, then there will be drought in Pakistan, and the people of that country would have to beg for every drop of water.” After the September 2016 attack by militants on an Indian army base in Kashmir, India announced plans to accelerate construction of dams in Kashmir on the rivers that flow into Pakistan and to suspend the bilateral Indus Waters Commission that administers the treaty and manages disputes over its implementation. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared “blood and water cannot flow together.” Pakistan for its part has announced that an Indian revocation of the treaty could be taken as an “act of war.” Pakistan’s government, nationalist and militant organizations, and right-wing media frequently now present India’s construction of dams in Kashmir as a pressing national security threat and one that may call for extreme responses. An editorial in one leading urdu-language Pakistani newspaper in 2011 declared “<span class='card-underline'>Pakistan should convey to India that a </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>war</span></span><span class='card-underline'> is possible </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>on the issue of water</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and this time war </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>will be a nuclear one</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.” </span>Nuclear forces and postures. Since the Indian and Pakistani nuclear weapon tests of May 1998, the two states have expanded many-fold their respective nuclear weapon and fissile material stockpiles and undertaken extensive development and testing of a diverse array of ballistic and cruise missiles (with ranges from 60 to 5000 kilometers), acquiring the ability to deploy and launch nuclear weapons from the air, from land, and from submarines at sea. They have put in place command and control systems and doctrines that involve, in the case of Pakistan, first use of nuclear weapons in a conflict and, in the case of India, massive retaliatory strikes against population centers. In 1999, the two countries fought a war which apparently included mobilization of nuclear weapons by Pakistan, making it the most significant military conflict between two nuclear armed states. They also went through a major military crisis (December 2001 to June 2002) triggered by an attack on India’s parliament by Islamist militants believed in India to be backed by Pakistan. The response to the attack included the two countries moving a combined total of more than half a million troops to their border. The slow pace of Indian deployment and inconclusive outcome of the stand-off led India’s army to begin planning and training for a more decisive and rapid conventional attack on Pakistan. Pakistan began testing a short-range, truck-mounted missile to deliver low-yield nuclear weapons on the battlefield. This latter development has increased longstanding international concerns about the security of nuclear weapons and fissile materials in Pakistan, given the large-scale and frequent Islamist militant attacks on military targets in the country and the ideological polarization within the armed forces and broader society associated with the rise of hardline Islamist political groups over the past three decades. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Pakistan has long been explicit about</span></span><span class='card-underline'> its </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>plans to use nuclear weapons to counter India</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>n</span> conventional forces. In March 2015, the former head of Pakistan’s Strategic Plans Division, retired General Khalid Kidwai, announced that the country had developed “a variety of short range, low yield nuclear weapons.” Pakistani Foreign Secretary Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry declared that his country might use these tactical nuclear weapons in a conflict with India. The New York Times reported in 2015 that so far, “an unknown number of the tactical weapons were built, but not deployed” by Pakistan. From tactical weapons to massive retaliation. India anticipates that Pakistan might use nuclear weapons against Indian conventional forces during a war. The Indian Army conducted a massive military exercise in April 2016 in the Rajasthan Desert bordering Pakistan, involving tanks, artillery, armored personnel carriers, and 30,000 soldiers who practiced what they would do if attacked with nuclear weapons on the battlefield. An Indian Army spokesman told the media that “our policy has been always that we will never use nuclear weapons first. But if we are attacked, we need to gather ourselves and fight through it. The simulation is about doing exactly that.” This was not the first such exercise. Indian nuclear doctrine also calls for massive retaliation directed at Pakistani cities, and Pakistan has threatened to respond in kind. In 2003, India’s cabinet declared nuclear weapons “will only be used in retaliation against a nuclear attack on Indian territory or on Indian forces anywhere… [<span class='card-underline'>N]uclear retaliation to a first strike will be massive and designed to inflict unacceptable damage</span>.” According to Admiral Vijay Shankar, a former head of Indian strategic nuclear forces, such retaliation would involve nuclear attacks on Pakistan’s cities. General Kidwai from Pakistan describes such Indian threats as “bluster and blunder,” since they “are not taking into account the balance of nuclear weapons of Pakistan, which hopefully not, but has the potential to go back and give the same kind of dose to the other side.” This seems an explicit suggestion of Pakistan planning to target Indian cities with nuclear weapons in retaliation of Indian nuclear attacks on Pakistani cities. From regional war to great power war. Time is not on our side. <span class='card-underline'>The failure to settle the</span> Kashmir <span class='card-underline'>dispute</span> despite the passage of 70 years <span class='card-underline'>has already triggered three wars</span>. While Pakistan clings grimly to its claims on Kashmir, India seems less inclined to compromise as it grows in economic and military power.

When they were still a part of the Soviet Union, the upstream republics—Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan—which have an abundance of water, would release some from their reservoirs in the spring and summer to generate electricity and nourish crops both on their own land and in the downstream republics, which would return the favor by providing gas and coal each winter. But since the dissolution of the Soviet Union over a quarter century ago, that system has collapsed. Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan now face constant blackouts and hope to build giant dams to provide for their energy needs. Kyrgyzstan completed its Kambarata-2 power station in 2010 and is building a second one, Kambarata-1, with the help of Russia. Although he doesn’t have the funds, Tajik President Emomali Rahmon often speaks zealously about his mission to build a 335-meter dam, Rogun, which has the potential to turn his impoverished statelet into a powerbroker. But there is one glaring issue: the region’s glaciers, the source of huge and once predictable water supplies, are melting at record rates. Every year, it loses about as much water as consumed by a country the size of Switzerland. And the dams stand to limit water supply even further for the downstream countries. This has set them on edge. Along the disputed frontiers of the Fergana Valley, which is spread out over three of the countries, locals bicker with their neighbors over irrigation water. These small spats quickly escalate. In 2014, Kyrgyz and Tajik conscripts exchanged fire over a strategic sluice in Ak-Sai. <span class='card-underline'>In Turkmenistan</span>, the driest of the nations and where seedlings wither in the capital, the madcap despot, <span class='card-underline'>President</span> Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow, <span class='card-underline'>is building a</span> 3,500-square-kilometer <span class='card-underline'>lake</span> in the desert. State media claim that the project, named the Golden Age Lake, has the blessings of “foreign scientists” who call the project a “wonderful example of the rational use of water resources.” Filling the lake would take 15 years, 2,600 kilometers of canals, and tons of water diverted from Uzbekistan. <span class='card-underline'>In response, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Uzbekistani President</span></span> Islam Karimov <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>warned</span></span> in 2012 <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>of a real war over water</span></span>. “I won’t name specific countries,” he said in 2012, clearly alluding to his fellow Central Asian ‘stans, “but <span class='card-underline'>all of </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>this could deteriorate to the point where</span></span><span class='card-underline'> not just serious confrontation, but even </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>wars could be the result</span></span>.”</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Water war is very possible</div><div class='cite'>Pederson 12 — (Ingrid Pederson, 9-15-2012, "Central Asia Could Go To War Over Water," Published by Business Insider, http://www.businessinsider.com/central-asia-really-could-go-to-war-over-lack-of-water-2012-9, Accessed 6-20-2018, JWS)</div><div class='card-body'><p><span class='card-underline'>'Water wars' refers to the idea that some countries, which hold enough water</span> to be able to export it, control headwaters of a river, or hold reservoirs/large sources of water, <span class='card-underline'>have an extremely strong source of leverage over water-scarce countries</span>. At times, this causes water to be thought of in simplistic terms as a commodity, rather than a basic building block of life, access to which is detailed in several international human rights conventions, but not explicitly recognized as a self-standing human right in international treaties. <span class='card-underline'>When countries deny other states water</span> or imply they might use water as leverage for political gain, <span class='card-underline'>this is water conflict, and </span><span class='card-underline'>it's brewing in Central Asia</span>. Within the context of Central Asia, to simplify, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan have it, and Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan need more of it. The latter two are very nervous about the resource imbalance. Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan are upstream of Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan, giving them control of two trans-border rivers. Eurasianet points out that <span class='card-underline'>one of the central issues facing</span> the five <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Central Asia</span></span>n republics <span class='card-underline'>is that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>leaders</span></span><span class='card-underline'> there </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>are more </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>known for rivalry than cooperation</span></span>, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>which could greatly</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>complicate any resolution on water</span></span> scarcity in the overall region. Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan are poorer than Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, so control over water is one of the few ways they are able to retain leverage over the (current) two international leaders in the region. Previously, Tajikistan has claimed that it needs to construct a hydroelectric power plant, which will improve the struggling economy, however, as Tye Sundlee reports, the recent discovery of a potential 'supergiant' oil field is likely to undermine these claims and stall the development of any hydroelectric power stations, especially since Uzbekistan has strenuously opposed plans for a power stations in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan for a number of years, worrying it will cede too much resource control to the poorer countries. But the question remains - what does all this squabbling add up to? Will these countries actually deny water to each other, in this dry region that is heavily dependent on crops? Uzbekistan is reportedly the sixth largest producer of cotton worldwide (though their harvest practices leave something to be desired), and Kyrgyzstan, though the economy is heavily dependent on gold exports, has a large and essential agricultural sector. Despite this need for water to sustain the economies of both countries, the answer to the above question is yes - <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan have used water as political leverage in the past</span></span><span class='card-underline'> for political gain </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>and could do so again</span></span>. Thus Karimov's harsh words last week, warning of water wars. In 2010, Kyrgyzstan diverted the flow of the Talas River, which is a source of irrigation of Kazakhstan's agricultural sector. Kyrgyzstan did so because Kazakhstan closed the border between two countries following uprisings and instability in Kyrgyzstan. A few hours after the river had been diverted, Kazakhstan re-opened the border. Confused? Here's the simplified take: Uprisings took place in Kyrgyzstan, so Kazakhstan closed the border. Kyrgyzstan wasn't happy about this, so they 'turned off the taps' to Kazakhstan, denying them water. A few hours after the water was diverted away from Kazakhstan, Kazakhstan relented and re-opened the borders to Kyrgyzstan. Thus we see water being used to achieve political measures. Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan are unhappy being in any way beholden to their poorer neighbors, but especially for something as vital as water - not only to their economies but to the literal life of their people. This precedent of water being used as leverage bodes poorly for water being seen as external to political gain, or as simply a human right. <span class='card-underline'>The leaders of Central Asia are already deeply suspicious of each other, and </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>border skirmishes are a common occurrence</span></span>. With Karimov already warning about water wars between the Central Asian countries, and the coming reverberations of the NATO pullout from Afghanistan, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>there is the looming possibility of </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>more instability in Central Asia</span></span>.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Empirics and high population growth make Central Asia uniquely likely to escalate a water conflict</div><div class='cite'>Shahbazov 17 — (Fuad Shahbazov, 2-6-2017, "Will Central Asia Fight Over Water Resources?," Published by Forbes, https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2017/02/06/will-central-asia-fight-over-water-resources/#52d88f574c1f, Accessed 6-20-2018, JWS)</div><div class='card-body'><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Water has always been a major cause of wars and border conflicts in the Central Asian region</span></span>. For being one of the greatest geographical regions, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Central Asia has limited water resources</span></span>. Modern history of the region has been fueled with various ethnic and territorial clashes. Apparently, the main catalysts behind conflicts have been attempts to take control of rich water resources. The main sources of water in Central Asia are the Syr Darya and Amu Darya Rivers, mostly fed by snow- and glacier-melt from the Pamir, Hindu Kush and Tien Shan mountain ranges. The 2,200-kilometer Syr Darya originates in the Tien Shan, flows through Kyrgyzstan as the Naryn River and combines with the Kara Darya to become the Syr Darya. The water resource crisis is not a new phenomenon in Central Asia. With the eventual fall of the Soviet Union, the resource-sharing system it imposed on the region totally disintegrated. <span class='card-underline'>The root of the problem is that the main water resources in Central Asia flow from territories of Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan</span>. Kyrgyzstan holds rule of downstream Syr-Darya flow at the Toktogul dam, while Tajikistan re-launched the building of Rogun dam on Vakhsh River, which was then shot down due to lack of funds and strained relations with neighboring Uzbekistan. If completed, Rogun dam will be able to ensure mountainous Tajikistan electricity, as it is in need of energy. Despite its quite favorable location in an energy-rich region, the Central Asian country faces energy-related problems. Kyrgyzstan faces the same problem with the water supply of Toktogul, which provides almost 90% of the country’s electricity. Tension also derives from conflict over the Toktogul water reservoir, which is a major point of contention for Kyrgyzstan and neighboring countries. The rich water resources of Kyrgyzstan further led to intensive border clashes with Uzbekistan several times. The latter deployed military troops along its border with Kyrgyzstan on March 24, 2016. Undoubtedly, Uzbekistan’s attempt to reclaim Ala-Buka water reservoir in Kyrgyzstan territory flared up tensions in the border and led to a deterioration of bilateral relations. Even though both countries are still far from reaching consensus over the water reservoir, Bishkek plans to build a Kambarata-3 Hydro Power Plant to produce hydro-energy for exporting to neighboring states, which will give Kyrgyzstan significant leverage over Uzbekistan. The Kambarata hydropower plant would be built on the Naryn River, a tributary of the Syr Darya. Along with Rogun dam, these two are to be the largest dams in Central Asia, with potential generating capacities of 1,900 megawatts and 3,600 megawatts. However, Tashkent strongly opposes this project, worrying that Kambarata will limit or disrupt the flow of irrigation water essential to its cotton fields and farmers. Although none of these dams are completed yet, concerns over how they would shift regional balance of power in Central Asia rise intensely. Yet, the failure of the Kyrgyz, Tajik and Uzbek governments to modernize water-dependent sectors, such as energy and agriculture increases their mutual dependence on each other. Considering this controversy, Uzbekistan enacts policy aimed at decreasing dependence from Toktogul reservoir by building a reservoir that is capable of storing 2.5 billion cubic meters of water. However, Uzbek authorities realized soon that it is nearly impossible to get enough power from the plant to provinces, in particular the Uzbek part of Fergana Valley, which highly suffers from lack of portable water and does not have any alternatives to farming. According to numbers, deficits of portable water in the Uzbek part of Fergana reach 1.5 billion cubic meters in a year, which is very high compared to Tajikistan and the Kyrgyzstan part of Fergana. The Fergana Valley, a landlocked, overpopulated region with 60 million people is a less favorable place for farming due to its desertification problem, outdated Soviet-era infrastructure (which has not been modernized since the 1950s) and poor water management, which exacerbates Fergana’s problems even worse. Fewer and fewer people have access to clean water since the collapse of the Soviet Union, because of low economic growth of newly independent states. Obviously, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>water dispute</span></span> is not the only problem in the region, as the <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>potential for conflict is</span></span> also <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>enhanced by high population growth rate</span></span> in the Fergana Valley. The Fergana Valley is a major source of food for Central Asia. The agricultural productivity has made the Fergana Valley the most densely populated part of Central Asia. While the population density of Central Asia as a whole is 40.8 people per square mile, in the Fergana Valley it is 1,600 people per square mile. It is also one of the fastest-growing regions within Central Asia, experiencing a population growth of 32% in the last 10 years.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Central Asian conflict definitely escalates</div><div class='cite'>Ziegler and Menon 14 — Ziegler is a Distinguished University Scholar and professor of political science at the University of Louisville; Menon holds the Anne and Bernard Spitzer chair in political science at the University of New York (Charles E.

However, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>regional organizations</span></span> like the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), the Central Asian Regional Economic Cooperation program (CEREC), and the Eurasian Economic Community (EurAsEc) seem to be preferred by Beijing and Moscow, since they <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>are relatively weak</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and do not preclude bilateral security</span> or trading arrangements. While regional organizations have become more prominent, there is still no viable trading regime in Central Asia. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>International cooperation is difficult to achieve</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> in the absence of a hegemon committed to establishing a stable order</span></span>. But the question for Beijing and Moscow is who the hegemon will be; neither China nor Russia is content to have the United States set and police the rules of the game because, in classic neomercantilist spirit, they are convinced Washington will play this role to advance its relative standing and not act in the interest of all. Russian and Chinese neomercantilist strategies, in effect, promote a regionalism that enables them to resolve conflicts and promote stability while resisting the presence of the global hegemon.36 Although Russia provides one-quarter to one-third of Central Asia’s imports and absorbs 10–20 percent of the region’s exports, its privileged position in the region is in danger of being eroded. China’s economic presence is increasing rapidly; more importantly, the China-Russia economic relationship in Central Asia is basically competitive and will become more so. This competition is already evident as Moscow promotes its Customs Union as a trading bloc, while China maneuvers to position the SCO as its preferred economic regime. In this environment, powerful state-controlled energy firms (and indeed non-energy state-owned companies) seek relative gains for their patron states, with the state exercising its power to advance firms’ interests. While the rivalry between the Russia-China partnership and the West gets the most attention these days, in the long run the competition in Central Asia will pit Beijing against Moscow, with both seeking to dominate the sources and transportation networks for Central Asia’s energy. This is not to suggest an imminent military conflict between Russia and China in Central Asia. But President Putin’s drive to expand the Customs Union into a broader Eurasian Union comprised of both Central Asian and European former Soviet republics provides regional elites with a guarantee against encroachment from powerful neighbors, whether from the East (China) or West (the EU and NATO).37 Membership in the Customs Union appeals to Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Belarus not because it will generate substantial economic benefits, but more so because of the political protection it will afford. In Ukraine’s case, conflicting pressures have splintered the country between those who prefer Moscow’s design and those who favor a European path. Unease over China’s growing presence in Central Asia and the absence of such clear lines of demarcation within these countries suggests that instability there will likely derive from state weakness and problems of succession rather than great-power competition.

In terms of capability, though, China’s base in Djibouti could potentially fulfill a role that goes beyond PKO and the control of piracy, and the port, railway and communication infrastructure could in theory be used not only for economic purposes but also for military purposes. In cases that involve enhancing this capability, doubts will be expressed by those countries if China does not maintain a certain degree of transparency and accountability and explain its intentions. And if Beijing makes loans that are beyond the ability of the recipient country to repay, China’s acquisition of controlling interests in the ports will give its neighbors to understand that it is leveraging this capability and its economic power to acquire those controlling interests. Those on the Chinese side no doubt view things from China’s perspective, but they would be well advised to take the views of its neighbors into account.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>China is just protecting trade routes and cooperating with other militaries</div><div class='cite'>Cooper 18 — Cooper is a fellow with the Asia team at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and received his PhD in security studies from Princeton (Zack Cooper, 4-2-2018, "Security Implications of China’s Military Presence in the Indian Ocean," Published by Center for Strategic and International Studies, https://www.csis.org/analysis/security-implications-chinas-military-presence-indian-ocean, Accessed 6-5-2018, JWS)</div><div class='card-body'><p>Expanding Influence in Peacetime</p><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>China’s increased</span></span><span class='card-underline'> military </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>presence in the Indian Ocean should not come as a surprise</span></span>. <span class='card-underline'>China is following in the traditional path of other rising powers; it is expanding its military operations to match its interests abroad</span>. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The Chinese economy is highly reliant on trade routes</span></span><span class='card-underline'> that pass </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>through the Indian Ocean</span></span>, which serves as a vital pathway, particularly for energy supplies. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>It is natural</span></span>, therefore, <span class='card-underline'>for the Chinese government </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>to </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>seek to protect its interests</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> along these sea lines</span></span><span class='card-underline'> of communication</span>. Leaders in Beijing have reason to be concerned about multiple potential risks in the region, ranging from maritime piracy to the potential for the United States or India to disrupt Chinese supply lines if a conflict were to occur. China’s efforts to project power in the Indian Ocean are nascent, but their outlines are becoming clear. To sustain military forces in the Indian Ocean region, China needs to have reliable access to facilities in key points around the region. China’s new military base in Djibouti provides a rudimentary power-projection base, which is bolstered by its access to ports in Bangladesh, Burma, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Although China is using its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to fund many of these projects, there is no question that the infrastructure is being created with dual-use purposes in mind. How might China use these facilities in peacetime? The most likely Chinese strategy would be to rely on port facilities to refuel and resupply its naval vessels without having to come back to Chinese facilities in East Asia. In the years ahead, it would not be surprising to see the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) develop some rudimentary facilities in the region for conducting at least minor repairs. These types of activities would provide China with a greater ability to sustain forces in theater, thereby avoiding the costly and time-consuming practice of having to foray from distant ports in mainland China. How might China use its forces in peacetime? In the near term, China will likely continue to conduct counter-piracy operations around the Horn of Africa. This serves multiple purposes. First, it gives Chinese forces practice conducting difficult operations at a great distance from the mainland. Such efforts are helpful for assessing shortcomings in the PLA’s ability to sustain power-projection forces far from China’s shores. Second, counter-piracy provides a window into the operational patterns of foreign militaries. This may be useful both from an intelligence-gathering perspective and for helping the PLA to compare its strengths and weaknesses to those of foreign militaries, including the United States, India, Japan, Australia, and others. Chinese vessels may also conduct some more specific intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions to better understand regional militaries and gather data on the geographic area in and around the Indian Ocean. Mapping undersea features would be particularly beneficial in preparing for a potential wartime scenario. Such activities could help to provide information on the typical operating practices of potential challengers, to include the Indian Navy. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>China may also</span></span><span class='card-underline'> seek to </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>conduct</span></span><span class='card-underline'> training and </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>exercises in the region</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, potentially </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>in partnership with other militaries</span></span>. Although Beijing is unlikely to find any highly capable partners in the region, it could work with less capable maritime states, such as Pakistan, to help them develop their maritime capabilities. This would also serve to expand the number of concerns for the Indian military, potentially stretching the Indian Navy. Such efforts could serve as a response to Indian efforts to build maritime capacity in Southeast Asia with states such as Vietnam. In short, Chinese operations in the Indian Ocean during peacetime are likely to resemble those of other great powers, including the United States. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Protection of trade</span></span><span class='card-underline'> routes </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is</span></span><span class='card-underline'> likely to be </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the primary objective</span></span>, but it will require substantial improvements in the PLA Navy’s ability to sustain forces at sea.

Deng Xiaoping is remembered for the concept of “Socialism with Chinese Characteristics,” President Jian Zeming is known for his nebulous governing “Theory of the Three Represents,” and President Hu Jintao for his ambition to achieve a “Harmonious Society.” Following their footsteps, President <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Xi</span></span> Jinping <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is extensively promoting</span></span><span class='card-underline'> his own signature slogan: </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the “Chinese Dream.”</span></span> President Xi’s Chinese Dream is a necessary and timely concept, which he made public for the first time in the China National Museum, surrounded by an exhibition documenting foreign invasions since the First Opium War in 1840, in particular. The painful humiliations that the Chinese nation suffered at the hands of the West and Japan are regularly revived by China’s leadership to energize and motivate the Chinese masses to participate in the Chinese Dream. Xi’s Chinese Dream can be seen as the spiritual dimension for which an increasingly wealthy and educated Chinese society is yearning. <span class='card-underline'>While various Chinese groups</span> (armed forces, farmers, officials, businessmen, etc.) <span class='card-underline'>have their own distinct interpretations of what the Chinese Dream means</span> and how it should be achieved, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>t</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>here is little controversy over its</span></span><span class='card-underline'> ultimate </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>goal: “fulfilling the</span></span><span class='card-underline'> great </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>renaissance of the Chinese race,” i.e. the Han race</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>.</span> <span class='card-underline'>Hence, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the Chinese Dream is</span></span><span class='card-underline'> essentially </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>a nationalistic ambition</span></span>. And while love and pride for one’s own culture, history, and country are not problematic per se, <span class='card-underline'>if not managed adequately, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>nationalism can nurture</span></span><span class='card-underline'> an undesirable sentiment</span>: chauvinism, in this case, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Han chauvinism</span></span>. Among the 56 officially recognized ethnic groups in China, the Han is by far the largest and influential one. It represents 92% of the Chinese population and has dominated the culture and politics for most of China’s 5,000-year long history. In the current China, Han are in full control of China’s politics, economy, and socio-cultural values. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Han consider their way of life</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and culture </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>superior to others</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, resulting in them having strong chauvinistic tendencies</span>. That Han chauvinism, or Hanism, poses a serious threat to China’s unity and stability have been extensively recognized by China’s leadership. Han Chauvinism: A Recognized Threat to China Communist Party of China’s (CPC) leaders such as Chairman Mao, Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaoping, and President Xi have warned about the threat that Han chauvinism poses. As early as 1938, and often thereafter, Chairman Mao cautioned Han officials about prevailing Hanism as a source of interethnic conflict and the need to eliminate it in order to achieve ethnic unity, the very foundation on which China’s stability should stand: Interethnic relationships are conflictive in certain regions due to Han chauvinism. Party members cannot tolerate this and we should deeply criticize Han chauvinism that occurs among party members and cadres… We should correct this mistake immediately. To correct Han chauvinism, Chairman Mao advised Han officials to be more humble, to listen to ethnic minorities’ grievances, and to accept their criticism. As for Premier Deng Xiaoping, he believed that Han chauvinism should be eliminated before asking minorities to do the same with their own chauvinisms: As soon as Han reject Han chauvinism, the ethnic minorities will also be willing to reject their own narrow nationalism in return. We cannot ask from ethnic minorities to reject their narrow nationalism without first honestly rejecting the one big nationalism (Hanism). Most recently, in 2014, President Xi Jinping and other CPC high-ranking officials discussed the threat of Han chauvinism during the Ethnic Affairs Work Conference, and released a statement emphasizing that “ethnic unity is the lifeline of Chinese people of all ethnicities and that to protect it we should stand firmly against great Hanism and ultra-nationalism.” These quotes illustrate the fact that CPC’s leadership continues to be aware of the magnitude of the threat that Han chauvinism poses to the Chinese nation. It seems, however, that the CPC has not yet been successful in harnessing it and now, the Chinese Dream might further reinforce Hanism. Despite China’s globalization, the Han continue to consider other cultures as inferior, resulting, for example, in the Han feeling that their culture and history is far superior to those of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang territory in northwest China. As a consequence of their discriminatory treatment by the Han, the Uyghurs feel that their identity is under attack and that they are being treated as second-class citizens in their own homeland. Han chauvinism seems to have been growing stronger in Xinjiang, particularly since the Urumqi riots in 2009, and it is dangerously undermining Beijing’s efforts to achieve harmonious inter-ethnic relations by impairing Han officials from understanding Xinjiang’s socioeconomic, political, religious, and security tensions. If the chauvinistic tendencies from which the Han community suffers are not recognized and addressed, Xinjiang’s inter-ethnic relations will worsen and could become a significant source of instability and threat to China. Furthermore, <span class='card-underline'>Chinese </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>chauvinism has already started</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>poisoning China’s</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>personal </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>relations in foreign countries</span></span>. For example, <span class='card-underline'>Chinese</span> businessmen and <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>officials traveling to Central Asian countries </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>ignore local traditions</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and values</span>, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>resulting in increasing tensions</span></span> with the local populations.

Even on economics, the subject of Xi’s latest big push, China will have a hard time posing as a credible leader for liberal values because China continues to routinely practice protectionism at home. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>China</span></span> famously and <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>routinely violates other countries’ intellectual property, subsidizes</span></span><span class='card-underline'> domestic </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>industry to undermine foreign competitors, and blocks foreigners from</span></span><span class='card-underline'> directly </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>investing in</span></span><span class='card-underline'> certain </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Chinese industries</span></span>. China can’t credibly claim to lead the way for trade liberalization if it doesn’t practice what it preaches and it won’t boost its soft power by setting expectations for how it will behave on trade that it has no intention of meeting. Nor is China well positioned to defend freedom of trade given its poor record on freedom of navigation. China’s actions in the South China Sea include making maritime claims such as the nine-dash line that have no basis in international law. Freedom of navigation is inherently bound up in freedom of trade. China’s insistence that it has the right to exclude others from the South China Sea undermines the credibility of any claim that it is defending the liberal world order.

The success of a majority of these startups heavily relies on STEM skillsets that include software/app development, data analytics and machine learning expertise, and the seamless integration of technologies that enhance user experiences. While the demand for STEM degrees continues to increase, the time needed to attain a higher education degree remains relatively constant and typically exceeds fifty-two months, well beyond the projected forty-eight months that students prefer. Several questions emerge from these findings: Is the rate of attaining a STEM degree or skillset keeping up with the evolving needs of society? Will advancements in automation and artificial intelligence reduce the demand for STEM workers? What policies should be considered to increase a nation’s competitiveness, in the age of artificial intelligence and automation? Is the rate of attaining a STEM degree or skillset keeping up with the evolving needs of society? <span class='card-underline'>There has been a significant </span><span class='card-underline'>decline</span><span class='card-underline'> in the number of students choosing to major in STEM degrees</span>, both at the undergraduate and graduate levels. While the reasons for this decline are multifaceted, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the</span></span> potential <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>societal implications are significant, especially in the digital age where value-creation is not only based on the functional capabilities of a new technology, but also the integration of that technology with other existing infrastructure</span></span>. Let us take for example a ride hailing app. From a user’s perspective, the interface is straightforward: users demands a ride from point A to point B, they get out their mobile device, open the app, enter their destination, and a vehicle is there to pick them up in minutes. However, the technological components needed to achieve this seemingly straightforward series of steps are enormous and include: the design of the chipsets used in the mobile device, the precision of the global positioning system (GPS) used to locate the user, the maintenance of the wireless network used to transmit data back and forth between the driver and the user, and most importantly, the seamless integration of these technologies that make all of this possible. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>As new companies are created and existing companies evolve, there will be an increased need for workers with skillsets that add value to these domains.

In 1983, the landmark report, A Nation at Risk, noted that “the ideal of academic excellence as the primary goal of schooling seems to be fading across the board in American education.”3 In 2005, nearly a quarter century after A Nation at Risk, the alarm once again was sounded over the looming challenge to U.S. pre-eminence in science and technology (S&T) in the National Academies’ seminal report, Rising Above the Gathering Storm. 4 This report posited that <span class='card-underline'>in the 21st century, educated, talented, motivated people and their ideas are paramount to creating the innovations that will sustain America’s prosperity</span>.5 Finally, in 2009, the Administration’s Strategy for American Innovation argued for investing in the building blocks of innovation, promoting competitive markets, and catalyzing breakthroughs for our Nation’s priorities.</p><p>A critical facet of America’s historical advantage in S&T innovation has been the ability to attract, develop, and retain talented individuals from abroad. Indeed, over the past few decades, many STEM fields in the United States have become increasingly dependent on foreign-born talent. However, <span class='card-underline'>global competition for STEM talent is growing</span> <span class='card-underline'>as many countries increase their R&D capacity and improve their own STEM education systems</span>. In light of this, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>it remains essential that the Nation</span></span> not only continue to attract STEM talent from abroad, but also <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>renew and redouble its efforts to identify and </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>develop domestic human capital</span></span> as well. </p><p>The Board’s 2-year examination of this issue made clear one fundamental reality: <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the U.S. education system too frequently </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>fails to identify and develop</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> our most talented and motivated students</span></span> who will become the next generation of innovators. Whether this group of students has access to appropriate resources seems to be an accident of birth—whether they are a part of a supportive and knowledgeable family or are residing in a community that has programs and opportunities available to them. <span class='card-underline'>There are students in every demographic and in every school district</span> in the United States <span class='card-underline'>with enormous potential to become our future STEM leaders and to define the leading edge of scientific discovery and technological innovation</span>. Some of our Nation’s most talented students—perhaps through sheer individual will, good fortune, and circumstance—rise through the educational system and become leading contributors to the scientific workforce. Regrettably, <span class='card-underline'>far too many of our most able students</span> <span class='card-underline'>are neither discovered nor developed, particularly those who have not had adequate access to educational resources, have not been inspired to pursue STEM, or who have faced numerous other barriers to achievement</span>. The possibility of reaching one’s potential should not be met with ambivalence, left to chance, or limited to those with financial means. Rather, the opportunity for excellence is a fundamental American value and should be afforded to all.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'><span class='card-highlight'>China is advancing over the US-- only the CP can solve hegemony.</span></div><div class='cite'><span class='card-highlight'>Evans, 18</span></div><div class='card-body'><p>(Gareth, PhD, writer for Army Technology, "Is the US military machine losing its innovation edge to China?', March 29 https://www.army-technology.com/features/us-military-machine-losing-innovation-edge-china/ NL)</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Innovation has been central to the US war machine since the end of WWII</span>, and, by implication, to the success of the rules-based system that has governed international relations over the same period too. American advances in nuclear weapons technology in the 1950s made possible the ‘first offset strategy’ nullifying the Soviet superiority in conventional numbers, and when Moscow narrowed the gap, heavy ‘second offset’ investment in emerging stealth and smart weapons technologies ensured the US lead remained through the 80s and 90s. But what of the decades since? US Secretary of Defense James Mattis, warned in his speech at John Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies on 19th January, “<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>our competitive edge has eroded in every domain of warfare, air, land, sea, space and cyberspace, </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>and it is continuing to erode</span></span>.” <span class='card-underline'>There is a growing consensus that the once-unassailable US technological advantage is fast fading, and might even soon be ceded to one of its rivals, probably China</span>, in the course of renewed competition between ‘Great Powers’, the like of which the world has not seen for over half a century. On the face of it, it is hard to see why. The US has certainly not become any less innovative or technologically capable than either Russia or China; current Defense News data shows that the United States is home to no fewer than 15 of the world’s top 25 defence contractors, and according to Forbes, exactly the same holds true for technology companies too. The talent is evidently there – but this is a game as much about focus as capability, and US attention has been distracted. An era of distraction: the demands of asymmetric warfare In fairness, the Twin Towers was hardly an event to be simply ignored, but in launching its ‘War on Terror’, Washington suddenly and dramatically shifted focus onto a very different kind of adversary and the new and immediate demands of asymmetric warfare and counter-insurgency. “In launching its ‘War on Terror’, Washington shifted focus onto a very different kind of adversary.” At the same time ‘second offset’ technologies were proliferating around the world, resources that would otherwise have been allocated towards developing and cementing ‘third offset’ weapons, and capabilities to maintain military dominance, were instead expended in Iraq and Afghanistan. While the US focused on dismantling the terrorists’ networks, training camps and safe-havens, China steadily ramped up its defence investment and innovation, developing its own systems and technologies to equip its military for the 21stCentury, and potentially challenge American hegemony in the Pacific. <span class='card-underline'>The irony is that, in many ways, the success of what Eisenhower dubbed the ‘military-industrial complex’</span>, a success that first helped the US to global pre-eminence in the first place, <span class='card-underline'>has also brought about its current predicament. Could the model that seemed so right for so long, now be quite wrong?</span> Consolidated dream teams and suffering competition “<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>We cannot expect success fighting tomorrow’s conflicts with yesterday’s weapons or equipment</span></span>,” Mattis told his audience at John Hopkins, and yet in essence that is often what the Department of Defense (DOD) does when it comes to technological innovation. The DOD development blueprint was well-honed for the era in which it was devised, but it is now increasingly beginning to look as if it has become outmoded. Big defence spending throughout the Cold War, followed by the huge consolidation of the US defence sector when both came to an end has left a legacy approach based on rigid requirements, and contracts aimed at the same small number of specialist contractors. In addition, the costs of the programmes are often so high that ‘dream teams’ of prime defence contractors, who should in theory be rivals, band together to bid for Pentagon projects. There are two big consequences. Firstly, <span class='card-underline'>having spent so much on their development and procurement, the resulting systems are almost invariably forced to remain in service for many years</span>, albeit modified and upgraded, irrespective of changing needs and technological advances. Secondly, and ultimately more importantly, competition inevitably suffers, and without the need to compete, there is little incentive to take a risk and innovate. As Eisenhower put it in the same 1961 farewell speech that first introduced the term ‘military-industrial complex’ to the common lexicon, “a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity.” The economic paradox of the innovation deficit Economic factors play a major role too. While the US has the world’s largest defence expenditure in dollar terms, paradoxically many point to a lack of DOD spending as one of the key reasons for the nation’s growing innovation deficit. An important budgetary trend lies hidden in the high absolute numbers. <span class='card-underline'>Since 2009, the US defence spend has fallen from 4.6% of GDP to just 3.3% today</span>, and although the latest figures from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute show that this decline has now been reversed, the fact remains that <span class='card-underline'>GDP expenditure on R&D is </span><span class='card-underline'>less than half what it was thirty years ago.</span> “Since 2009, the US defence spend has fallen from 4.6% of GDP to just 3.3% today.” For small-to-medium companies in the mid- and lower-tiers of the sector, that generates something of a crisis of commercial confidence when it comes to investing heavily in developing precisely the kinds of technologies that the Pentagon needs for the future. <span class='card-underline'>The same is certainly not true in China, where innovation in the industry is booming</span>, creating the ideal conditions to incubate a talent pool for the future that is as competitive as it is inventive. It is hard to imagine that the two things are not related. However, it would be far too simplistic to suggest that it is simply all about government investment. If technology is to remain at the heart of the oft-quoted US ‘overmatch’, the DOD also needs to address changing marketplace realities and accept that with the huge expansion of global tech firms, defence contracts are now significantly less influential than they once were. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Putting it bluntly, </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the Pentagon no longer has the deepest pockets in town</span></span>. In the 2015 study ‘National Security Technology Accelerator: A Plan for Civil-Military Industry Innovation’ from New York University, the authors observed that “<span class='card-underline'>the emergence of international commercial and consumer high-tech markets over the past two decades has substantially displaced DOD as the centre of gravity for global R&D activity</span>.” It is for these markets that many of the cutting-edge technologies that the US military may one day come to depend on are being developed, not the traditional defence contract route. Reshaping relationships: Forging new commercial partnerships That does not automatically make for a tale of doom and gloom. The DOD has a long history of working successfully with the private sector, and some of today’s most profoundly important technologies, including the internet and GPS navigation, arose directly as a result, while many others have been significantly boosted by defence funded projects. Nevertheless, as Adam Jay Harrison, the National Security Technology Accelerator director, has pointed out, too many technology businesses – even some that have previously enjoyed DOD support – are now “turning their backs” on the Pentagon. The challenge is to re-forge and reshape the relationship between commercial technology companies and the military to make it fit for this century, not the last. “One path to more fully align civilian technology opportunities with the Defense enterprise is for DOD to radically rethink its approach to acquisition and industry engagement in a manner that is more consistent with commercial market norms,” the New York University study concludes. If it does not, then the risk of the US losing its long-standing innovative edge becomes very real indeed – and China is waiting.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'><span class='card-highlight'>The CP’s economic and military expansion is the only way to solve the advantage</span></div><div class='cite'><span class='card-highlight'>Burns, 14</span></div><div class='card-body'><p>(Nicholas Burns, Professor of the Practice of Diplomacy and International Politics at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government and former U.S. Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs What Washington Can Do to Revive Relations With New Delhi, Foreign Affairs, 00157120, Sep/Oct2014, Vol. 93, Issue 5)</p><p>In the century ahead, U.S. strategic interests will align more closely with India's than they will with those of any other continental power in Asia.

As Washington expands its presence in Asia</span> as part of the so-called pivot, <span class='card-underline'>New Delhi will be a critical partner</span>. In the Asia-Pacific region, especially, India joins Australia, Japan, South Korea, and others in a U.S.-led coalition of democratic allies. And as the most powerful state in South Asia, India will exert a positive influence on a troubled Afghanistan, as well as on Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. The <span class='card-underline'>Obama</span> administration <span class='card-underline'>should</span> therefore use its remaining two years to <span class='card-underline'>make India a greater priority,</span> especially since the country has not yet figured prominently in the rebalancing of U.S. attention and resources to Asia.

The leaders are scheduled to hold their first meeting in Washington this September, and before they do, <span class='card-underline'>both should begin thinking about rebuilding the</span> U.S.-Indian <span class='card-underline'>relationship in five key ways:</span> <span class='card-underline'>by expanding bilateral trade</span>, <span class='card-underline'>strengthening military cooperation</span>, collaborating to combat threats to homeland security, stabilizing a post-American Afghanistan, <span class='card-underline'>and</span>, especially, <span class='card-underline'>finding greater common ground on transnational challenges </span>such as climate change. It is an ambitious agenda, but <span class='card-underline'>pursuing it would put India where it belongs: at the center of U.S. strategy in the region</span>. FALLING OUT Many Indian officials look back on the presidency of George W. Bush as a special moment in U.S.-Indian relations. From his first days in office, Bush made India a priority, arguing that its flourishing market economy, entrepreneurial drive, democratic system, and growing young population were crucial to U.S. aims in the region. He saw that the two countries, far from being strategic rivals, shared many of the same views on how power should be balanced in the twenty-first century. He believed that the United States had a clear interest in supporting India's rise as a global power. The results of his emphasis were dramatic. <span class='card-underline'>The volume of trade in goods and services between the United States and India has more than tripled since 2004.</span> Also since then, the two governments have dramatically strengthened their military ties and launched new cooperative projects on space, science and technology, education, and democratic governance. Bush also engineered one of the most important initiatives in the history of the U.S.-Indian relationship: the civil nuclear agreement, which for the first time permitted U.S. firms to invest in India's civil nuclear power sector. (I served as the lead American negotiator for the deal.) This agreement helped end India's nuclear isolation, allowing New Delhi to trade in civil nuclear technology even though it is not a party to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. In return, India opened up its civil nuclear industry for the first time to sustained international inspection. The agreement's real import, though, lay in its message to the Indian people: the United States took their country seriously and wanted to leave behind the previous decades of cool relations. More broadly, it was a signal of U.S. support for India's emerging global role. When Obama took office, he followed Bush's lead. After all, Bush's India policy had enjoyed rare and strong support from Democrats -- including then U.S. Senators Joseph Biden, Hillary Clinton, and Obama himself -- throughout his second term. In 2009, Obama hosted then Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his wife as the administration's first official state visitors. During his own successful state visit to New Delhi in 2010, Obama became the first U.S. president to endorse India's bid to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council. Yet despite this promising start, <span class='card-underline'>Obama's India policy never hit full stride</span>. Although Clinton, as secretary of state, collaborated with New Delhi on development and women's issues, the administration was understandably preoccupied with the more urgent short-term crises it had inherited on taking office: the global financial meltdown, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the threat of a nuclear Iran. It was a classic Washington story of near-term crises crowding out long-term ambitions. As Obama's first term ended, India slid down Washington's priority list, and Indian officials complained privately about what they saw as a lack of attention from their American counterparts. To be fair to Obama, however, <span class='card-underline'>the Indian government played an even greater role in the relationship's decline. </span>In 2010, the Indian Parliament passed an ill-advised nuclear liability law that placed excessive responsibility on suppliers for accidents at nuclear power plants. The legislation, which gained support after the 25th anniversary of a horrific chemical spill at an American-owned plant in Bhopal, shattered investor confidence. By deterring U.S. and other firms from entering the Indian market, the law made implementation of the civil nuclear agreement impossible, undermining what should have been the centerpiece of the two countries' relationship. Washington and New Delhi haven't managed to resolve the impasse. The relationship suffered further when Indian economic growth slowed markedly in 2012 and 2013, depressing foreign investment, as the government, led by the Indian National Congress, was rocked by corruption allegations and failed to implement promised reforms in retail, insurance, energy, and infrastructure. New Delhi unwisely imposed discriminatory taxes on foreign investors and enacted protectionist measures that impeded trade. A series of bitterly fought U.S.-Indian trade disputes took center stage, overshadowing the political and military ties that had been the glue of the growing partnership and preventing the two countries from being able to strike any major new economic agreements. Then came two severe diplomatic tempests. Over the course of 2013, as Modi emerged as a front-runner in the upcoming election, the Indian press revived the story of Washington's earlier decision to bar Modi from entering the United States on the grounds that he had failed to suppress deadly anti-Muslim riots in 2002, when he was chief minister of Gujarat. Bush administration officials, including me, believed this to be the right decision at the time, but many Modi supporters charged that the visa ban was yet another example of American disregard for Indian dignity. Then, in December 2013, U.S. federal agents arrested Devyani Khobragade, India's deputy consul general in New York, for lying on her housekeeper's visa application, infuriating the Indian press and public. It was a perfect but avoidable storm. The United States should have handled the visa issue at the core of the dispute in private to avoid inflaming India's bruised ego, and the Indian government, which made matters worse by downgrading security at the U.S. embassy in New Delhi and refusing to renew teachers' visas at the American Embassy School, should have reacted more calmly. Instead, both governments fanned the flames, and anti-American furor dominated the news in India for weeks. <span class='card-underline'>By early 2014, the collapse in confidence was all too visible, and this is what Obama and Modi must begin working to repair when they meet</span>.

The principle driving force of the media campaign is the traditional China-India rivalry, and its collective pitch is that OBOR is aimed at promoting an imperial Chinese dominance in East Asia, South Asia, and elsewhere. Of course, East Asia is China’s old stomping ground and, as a rising power, it is natural that Beijing would expand its sphere of influence. A more rational response for India in East Asia is to try and outbid China diplomatically and economically by creating small alliances of its own and by offering economic assistance through its own longstanding Look East strategy. Look East, however, has a problem: While it has long looked good on paper, the strategy has never been followed consistently or vigorously by successive Indian prime ministers. Pursuing mega-strategies has never been India’s wont, and in any case the country until recently has lacked the deep funds needed to throw money at Southeast Asian countries who have been sympathetic to India’s aspirations and who would have been happy recipients of its economic assistance. Under Modi things changed. He brought to office a strong desire to couch China-India ties as essentially competitive. But India’s political culture is not so quick to absorb changes of that magnitude. Indian bureaucracies are full of personnel who are deeply mired in the Nehruvian notion of vacuous moralism, which was deeply committed to non-alignment and never paid much attention to the Great Power politics of the 1950s and 1960s. This created a lot of hoopla during the Cold War years, but that hoopla no longer finds an audience, even within Third World countries in the 21st century. <span class='card-underline'>While emphasizing the competitive nature of Indo-Chinese strategic ties, Modi also has made sure that his country continues to take advantage of China’s own interests in cultivating its economic ties with India</span>. This is a nuanced policy from the side of both Beijing and New Delhi. <span class='card-underline'>As much as Sino-Indian strategic competition remained hot for the past several decades, neither New Delhi nor Beijing wanted to jeopardize their bilateral economic trade.</span> Consequently, bilateral trade "surged from under $3 billion in 2000 to nearly $52 billion in 2008)…. Even conservative estimates suggest that, by 2020, China-India trade could surpass last year’s US-China total of $409.2 billion and more than half of total projected US-China trade in 2020." As China continues to travel toward its goal of becoming the second superpower, it sees India as a challenger that should not be ignored for at least two reasons. First, India has managed to develop close strategic ties with the United States through the purchase of military weapons, the planning of joint military exercises, and the transfer of technology. India also aspires to become a member of the Nuclear Supply Group, after which it would likely become a serious competitor of China in the area of nuclear weapons development. That is one reason why China continues to veto India’s entry into that group, even while it leaves all doors of mutual economic cooperation wide open. China’s greatest success in gaining the upper hand over India is in its multifaceted strategic ties with Pakistan. <span class='card-underline'>The emergence of a nuclear Pakistan</span>, in which China’s transfer of nuclear knowledge and blueprints of actual nuclear weapons designs played a major role, <span class='card-underline'>tied down India’s own nuclear preparedness on two different fronts: China and Pakistan. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>What bothers India the most is the fact that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor has not only given Pakistan the promise of emergence as a major economic actor</span></span>, but that the corridor passes through the disputed territory of Kashmir on the Pakistan border. It is reported that China tried to appease India by offering to change the name of the corridor through Pakistan; however, it dropped that suggestion after Pakistan protested. India’s major objection to the inclusion of the disputed territory was one explicit reason why it decided to boycott the OBOR summit. India’s neighbors are sold on President Xi’s sales pitch for OBOR, which he called the “project of the century,” and these states are poised to join it. Since poverty is the dominant issue throughout South Asia, <span class='card-underline'>China’s promise that this program will tackle poverty makes a lot of sense to India’s neighbors. India says that promise is mere hype. But as Western-oriented globalization continues to hurt their economies through high unemployment and rising inflation, most poverty-stricken countries of the Third World have started to envision OBOR as a source of economic assistance and financial relief</span>. Another Indian criticism depicts OBOR as imperialistic in nature. As one of the main leaders of the non-aligned movement of the Cold War years, India still presumes itself to be a rightful actor to question China’s motives regarding its role as the rising economic power of the 21st Century. However, as another rising economic power of Asia, and an actor that emulates China’s policies of seeking alliances and offering economic assistance to several countries, India is open to like criticism from Beijing. And China never fails to remind the world that, as a former victim of imperialistic policies and occupation by the West and Japan, it has remained firmly opposed to such policies. The global hubs of economic activities -- places such as New York, London, and Berlin -- are likely to have new additions including Beijing and Shanghai. India, meanwhile, has not been able to find an equally promising way to counter OBOR. So, it is left with flimsy excuses (flimsy in the sense that they find no global supportive audience) like criticizing that strategy because it involves the disputed territory of Kashmir that is under Pakistani administration. In all likelihood, through OBOR, the Chinese view of the hierarchy of nations and the pecking order of nation-states is likely to change. <span class='card-underline'>Despite all of the criticisms of its potential complications and its chances for failure, and </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>India’s related suspicion of China’s ulterior motives, OBOR carries with it the </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>enormous economic power</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> of China and an </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>equally powerful resolve by its leadership</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> to make it a success</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> Even the United States and Japan realize that and are likely to remain involved in it without joining it, for now. India might be well-advised to revise its own refusal to join. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Given this reality, the best option for India is to join OBOR and to add a new dimension to its competition with China, rather than to find inane reasons to criticize it and to boycott the initiative</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>.</span></p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Canada’s general population is so committed to resettlement the nation’s capacity is far from exhausted</div><div class='cite'>Kantor and Einhorn, 16 – Jodi Kantor is a Pulitzer-prize winning American journalist.

When Ms. McLorg walked into the hotel lobby to meet Mr. Mohammad and his wife, Eman, she had a letter to explain how sponsorship worked: <span class='card-underline'>For one year, Ms. McLorg and her group would provide financial and practical support</span>, from subsidizing food and rent to supplying clothes to helping them learn English and find work. <span class='card-underline'>She and</span> her <span class='card-underline'>partners</span> had <span class='card-underline'>already raised more than 40,000 Canadian dollars</span> (about $30,700), <span class='card-underline'>selected an apartment, talked to the local school and found a</span> nearby <span class='card-underline'>mosque</span>. Ms. McLorg, the mother of two teenagers, made her way through the crowded lobby, a kind of purgatory for newly arrived Syrians. Another member of the group clutched a welcome sign she had written in Arabic but then realized she could not tell if the words faced up or down. When the Mohammads appeared, Ms. McLorg asked their permission to shake hands and took in the people standing before her, no longer just names on a form. Mr. Mohammad looked older than his 35 years. His wife was unreadable, wearing a flowing niqab that obscured her face except for a narrow slot for her eyes. Their four children, all under 10, wore donated parkas with the tags still on. For the Mohammads, who had been in Canada less than 48 hours, the signals were even harder to read. In Syria, Abdullah had worked in his family’s grocery stores and Eman had been a nurse, but after three years of barely hanging on in Jordan, they were not used to being wanted or welcomed. “You mean we’re leaving the hotel?” Abdullah asked. To himself, he was wondering, “What do these people want in return?” <span class='card-underline'>Much of the world is reacting to the refugee crisis — 21 million displaced</span> from their countries, <span class='card-underline'>nearly five million of them Syrian</span> — <span class='card-underline'>with </span><span class='card-underline'>hesitation or hostility</span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> <span class='card-underline'>Greece shipped desperate migrants back</span> to Turkey; <span class='card-underline'>Denmark confiscated</span> their <span class='card-underline'>valuables</span>; and even <span class='card-underline'>Germany</span>, which <span class='card-underline'>has</span> accepted more than half a million refugees, is struggling with <span class='card-underline'>growing resistance</span> to them. <span class='card-underline'>Broader anxiety about immigration and borders helped motivate Britons</span> to take the extraordinary step last week of voting <span class='card-underline'>to leave the E</span>uropean <span class='card-underline'>U</span>nion. <span class='card-underline'>In the U</span>nited <span class='card-underline'>S</span>tates, <span class='card-underline'>even before</span> the <span class='card-underline'>Orlando</span> massacre <span class='card-underline'>spawned</span> new <span class='card-underline'>dread about “lone wolf” terrorism, a majority of American governors</span> said they <span class='card-underline'>wanted to </span><span class='card-underline'>block Syrian refugees</span><span class='card-underline'> because some could be dangerous.</span> Donald J. <span class='card-underline'>Trump</span>, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has <span class='card-underline'>called for temporary bans on all Muslims</span> from entering the country <span class='card-underline'>and</span> recently <span class='card-underline'>warned that Syrian refugees would cause “big problems in the future.”</span> The Obama administration promised to take in 10,000 Syrians by Sept. 30 but has so far admitted about half that many. Just <span class='card-underline'>across the border</span>, however, <span class='card-underline'>the Canadian government can barely keep up with</span> the <span class='card-underline'>demand to welcome them</span>. Many volunteers felt called to action by the photograph of <span class='card-underline'>Alan Kurdi, the Syrian toddler whose body washed up</span> last fall on a Turkish beach. He had only a slight connection to Canada — his aunt lived near Vancouver — but his death <span class='card-underline'>caused recrimination so strong it helped elect an idealistic, refugee-friendly prime minister,</span> Justin <span class='card-underline'>Trudeau</span>. The Toronto Star greeted the first planeload by splashing “Welcome to Canada” in English and Arabic across its front page. Eager sponsors toured local Middle Eastern supermarkets to learn what to buy and cook and used a toll-free hotline for instant Arabic translation. Impatient would-be sponsors — “an angry mob of do-gooders,” The Star called them — have been seeking more families. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The new government committed to taking in 25,000 Syrian refugees and then raised the total by tens of thousands. “I can’t provide refugees fast enough for all the Canadians who want to sponsor them,” John McCallum, the country’s immigration minister, said in an interview</span></span>. In the ideal version of private sponsorship, the groups become concierges and surrogate family members who help integrate the outsiders, called “New Canadians.” The hope is that the Syrians will form bonds with those unlike them, from openly gay sponsors to business owners who will help them find jobs to lifelong residents who will take them skating and canoeing. Ms. McLorg’s group of neighbors and friends includes doctors, economists, a lawyer, an artist, teachers and a bookkeeper. Advocates for sponsorship believe that private citizens can achieve more than the government alone, raising the number of refugees admitted, guiding newcomers more effectively and potentially helping solve the puzzle of how best to resettle Muslims in Western countries. <span class='card-underline'>Some advocates</span> even <span class='card-underline'>talk about extending the Canadian system across the globe</span>.

The <span class='card-underline'>2018 Canada’s World Survey</span>, conducted by the Environics Institute for Survey Research, is an update to a survey they first conducted in 2008<span class='card-underline'>. It measures how Canadian attitudes have shifted</span> and looks at issues that have emerged over the past decade. Despite major world events — from the global recession, terrorist attacks, increasing tensions with North Korea and growing frustration with Western governments — Canadians’ opinions have remained mostly consistent. <span class='card-underline'>A majority of Canadians continue to see Canada as an international role model with 86 per cent of respondents saying the country can have a positive impact on world affairs </span>— both in 2008 and in 2018<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>. Global migration and accepting refugees is the top global issue where Canadians believe the country can make a difference</span></span>. Thirty-eight per cent of those surveyed say Canada can make a big difference, 44 per cent say the country can make some difference while 16 per cent said we could make little or no difference. At the same time, 25 per cent of respondents think <span class='card-underline'>the most important contribution the country can make to the world is accepting immigrants and multiculturalism</span>, a shift from ten years ago when peacekeeping topped the list. The Discourse partnered with Environics to gain early access to the findings of the Canada’s World Survey. After combing through the data, we want to dig deeper into what Canadians think about welcoming refugees. How Canadians feel about refugees. Amea Wilbur, training manager at the Pacific Immigrant Resources Society (PIRS) in Vancouver, says she felt a shift in attitude over the last two years with the influx of would-be volunteers contacting her team. “<span class='card-underline'>I really saw </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>when t</span></span><span class='card-underline'>he </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Syrians came</span></span><span class='card-underline'> that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>people really stepped up</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. Like we got calls constantly,”</span> she says, adding that these were often people who had maybe never considered volunteering to support newcomers before. Drawing from what the respondents said, the survey estimates that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>two million adult Canadians were involved directly in the sponsorship of refugees</span></span>, with another seven million who knew someone who did. Seven per cent of the Canada’s World Survey respondents said they had direct involvement with welcoming refugees while 25 per cent said they know someone who did. Francisco Rico-Martinez, co-director of the FCJ Refugee Centre in Toronto, isn’t surprised at those numbers — but what he really wants to know is if Canadians are building meaningful relationships. It has to go beyond getting together for tacos, he laughs<span class='card-underline'>. “We need to create a more fair society for everyone.”</span> For him, that means not just recognizing multiculturalism but also practicing it in our justice system, social services and economic opportunities. <span class='card-underline'>“We have to build a society that is more inclusive even now — that is creating more equality [and] more justice.”</span> And while Canada may be a role model for other countries, Rico-Martinez says <span class='card-underline'>it “needs to be a more aggressive role model” that fights for social equality</span>. Should Canada do more to help the global refugee crisis. Yasmin Ullah, a 26-year-old Rohingya woman, recalls her journey to Canada as a refugee from Myanmar. “There are so many willing people to help, willing to give — it’s incredible,” she says. Over half a million Rohingya, a stateless Muslim minority, have fled Myanmar since conflict escalated there in 2017. Ullah’s family escaped to northern Thailand when she was three years old. They lived there for years while trying to find a way through the international asylum system, relying on fake identification. Eventually, she says, she, her brother and father were privately sponsored by church groups and came to Canada in June 2011. Today, all three are Canadian citizens living in Surrey, B.C. “The first thing I wanted to do in Canada was get back on my feet,” says Ullah, who now works at a dental office while balancing political science courses at Kwantlen Polytechnic University and Rohingya advocacy work. <span class='card-underline'>She believes there is a tendency to think Canada has done enough as a society, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>but says there is huge potential to do more</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>— both through financial support for resettlement abroad and <span class='card-underline'>through welcoming more newcomers into the country.</span></p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>CP solves better because-

The 3/10 year bar14 is not triggered by a violation of status resulting from unauthorized employment but an overstay past the I-94 validity. For this reason, a retroactive EAD would do nothing to ameliorate the crushing harshness of the 3/10 year bar, though it might restore eligibility in some situations to adjust by avoiding the unauthorized employment preclusion of INA 245(c).15 What would cure the prior unlawful presence would be a retroactive granting of parole. Look at the definition of "unlawful presence" in INA 212 (a)(9)(B)(ii). It speaks of being "present in the United States after the expiration of the period of stay authorized by the Attorney General or is present in the United States without being admitted or paroled."

In addition, the INA establishes various mechanisms for enforcing these rules, including by prescribing the removal of aliens found to have entered the United States without permission, or to have violated the terms governing their authorized admission into the country.8 It also established criminal penalties for certain immigration violations. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>On the other hand, </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the INA expressly or impliedly confers some discretionary authority on the executive branch in matters of immigration enforcemen</span></span><span class='card-underline'>t</span>. For example, the <span class='card-underline'>INA authorizes immigration officials to grant certain types of benefits or relief to qualifying aliens who </span><span class='card-underline'>lack lawful immigration status</span>. Moreover, the <span class='card-underline'>INA permits immigration officials to waive certain statutory restrictions that might otherwise render an alien ineligible to receive particular immigration benefits</span>. The exercise of <span class='card-underline'>these discretionary authorities may enable some unlawfully present aliens to remain in the United States—through asylum</span>, <span class='card-underline'>temporary protected status</span>, <span class='card-underline'>cancellation of removal, or some other means—rather than being removed</span>.

For example, immigration officials may opt to give a lower priority to the removal of certain categories of unlawfully present aliens because the removal of other categories (e.g., those convicted of serious crimes) has been deemed a higher priority in light of resource constraints and other considerations.16 Congressional enactments could, however, be seen as limiting the executive’s discretion not to take particular actions (e.g., by mandating that certain aliens be detained pending removal proceedings).17 The express adoption of an executive policy that is “in effect an abdication of ... statutory duty” could also be found to be impermissible,18 but <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>it might be difficult for a court to assess the degree of nonenforcement that would entail an “abdication</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>.”</span></span><span class='card-underline'> The executive branch’s discretion to interpret applicable statutes </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>when Congress has not spoken to the precise question at issue may also afford immigration officials some flexibility in determining how INA requirements apply to a particular alien or category of alien</span></span><span class='card-underline'>s</span>.19 This discretion may be relevant in determining how particular statutory grants of discretionary authority are to be applied (e.g., what constitutes “exceptional and extremely unusual hardship” for purposes of cancellation of removal, or “extreme hardship” for purposes of certain waivers of inadmissibility).20 It can also play a role in determining whether and how particular statutes are seen to circumscribe the Executive’s enforcement discretion.

Although the difference between "extraordinary," "exceptional," and "skilled" may seem trivial in any other context, these labels have a profound effect on aspiring immigrants.</span> n57 The highly meritocratic system of visa allocations must be reexamined in light of this situation.</p><p>II. Negative Effects of a Hyper-Meritocratic EB Immigration Regime</p><p><span class='card-underline'>The hyper-meritocracy of the current EB immigration regime is problematic</span> for three main reasons: <span class='card-underline'>its furtherance of global brain drain, its failure to optimize U.S. economic interests</span>, and the undemocratic and "un-American" value judgment that underlies it.</p><p>A. Global Brain Drain</p><p>The phenomenon of international brain drain is based on two premises: there are few highly educated people in developing nations,  [*936]  and those highly educated people are extremely likely to emigrate. n58 It is defined as a "significant loss of the highly educated population" resulting in negative economic effects in the sending country. n59 These negative effects are often twofold, including a loss of human capital as well as a loss of the government's return on its investment in its citizenry. n60 For example, a developing country may invest significant amounts of money in educating and providing healthcare to its youths on the understanding that they will mature into informed, healthy, and productive members of the national society. n61 That understanding collateralizes the investment. n62 Whenever a highly skilled, highly educated citizen emigrates, the country enters a loss on its ledger.</p><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Although it is understandable that the best and brightest of a developing nation emigrate for a better life and additional opportunities, this </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>strips the sending nation</span></span> (perhaps more aptly described as the deprived nation) <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>of valuable resources necessary for continuing development</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> In this regard, <span class='card-underline'>African countries have been acutely affected, and widespread emigration from the continent </span><span class='card-underline'>"</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>threatens Africa with yet another net loss of quality human resources" similar to the effect of the slave trade</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> n63 <span class='card-underline'>One scholar estimates that twenty to fifty percent of the "top African brains and skilled personnel" have left the continent and fail to retain significant professional ties with their homelands.</span> n64 The 2005 World Migration Report, compiled by the International Organization for Migration, called attention to the loss of human resources from the continent, a trend which one scholar predicts will culminate in Africa's transformation into an "intellectually barren ghetto." n65</p><p>By contrast, developed countries benefit greatly from this continual injection of brains and talent, and they even compete with each other over immigrant candidates. n66 As Professor Ayelet Shachar, of  [*937]  the law faculty at the University of Toronto, explains, "industrial countries are trying to outbid one another ... to attract highly skilled migrants to their domestic industries in order to gain (or retain) a relative advantage over their international competitors in the knowledge-based global economy." n67 From this perspective, encouraging highly skilled immigration becomes yet another strategy in the broad reach of a developed country's economy. n68 Reflecting upon this conceptualization of the immigrant as human capital, Professor Kunal M. Parker, of Cleveland-Marshall College of Law, aptly concludes that receiving countries measure the value of an aspiring immigrant based on her profile as "homo oeconomicus." n69 Thus, brain drain is the inevitable symptom of a widespread "reimagination of legal immigration in terms of productivity, skill, resources, and self-sufficiency." n70</p><p><span class='card-underline'>The</span> <span class='card-underline'>U</span>nited <span class='card-underline'>S</span>tates <span class='card-underline'>is the most popular destination country for skilled immigrants</span>, n71 and it is easy to imagine why. The nation boasts expansive opportunities for the well-educated and highly skilled, and its immigration policies reward such a showing of talent. Admittedly, arguments appealing to international concerns often do not fare well in shaping U.S. laws. n72 U.S. immigration law is, without illusion, designed with the goal of furthering U.S. interests. n73 Critics of U.S. immigration policy have often urged an even stronger preferencing of  [*938]  elite immigrants rather than tempering the meritocracy. n74 This position is understandable and in no sense irrational from either a legal or policy perspective; after all, the United States was arguably founded on the ideas that social mobility was possible and that hard work and high achievement would be rewarded. n75</p><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Brain drain</span></span> is detrimental, however, even with purely domestic goals in mind: it <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>directly undercuts U.S. foreign policy regarding global development and democracy promotion and also subverts border control policy aimed at reducing unauthorized entrie</span></span><span class='card-underline'>s</span>. The United States Agency for International Development ("USAID") states its "twofold purpose" as "furthering America's foreign policy interests in expanding democracy and free markets while improving the lives of the citizens of the developing world." n76 It is the main U.S. governmental agency charged with promoting economic and democracy development around the globe. n77 USAID is not unaware of the benefits and detriments of brain drain. In a presentation to USAID on the relationship between migration and development, the Migration Policy Institute emphasized the "potential [domestic] benefits of a 'brain export' industry," while at the same time acknowledging that efforts to repatriate such highly skilled immigrants - and thus mitigate the negative effects in sending countries - have generally failed. n78</p><p>[*939]  <span class='card-underline'>Although remittances by highly skilled and highly educated migrants may contribute to economic development in sending countries, it is harder to assert that these remittances similarly contribute to democracy promotion</span>, which has become a prominent focus of USAID policy since 2002. n79 <span class='card-underline'>Democracy</span>, especially in contrast to other forms of governance, <span class='card-underline'>requires a certain financial stability and economic security in governmental entities</span>; the populace relies on the state to provide healthcare, educate the nation's youth, and, at least to some extent, redistribute wealth. n80 <span class='card-underline'>Democratic governments must also exercise self-determination over their economic policies, a significant feat in the current international political economy.</span> n81 <span class='card-underline'>The infrastructure and bureaucratic capabilities necessary to accomplish these stepping stones to democracy rely on an educated, informed citizenry</span><span class='card-underline'>, which must fill the roles of leaders and constituencies.</span> <span class='card-underline'>Promoting "brain export" hardly seems consistent with promoting democracy, and, therefore, the </span><span class='card-underline'>U</span>nited <span class='card-underline'>S</span>tates <span class='card-underline'>impairs its own global policy goals with its domestic immigration law</span>. n82</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Border control policy is also underserved by an EB immigration system that engenders brain drain. Immigration is often motivated by a lack of employment and economic opportunity in the home country</span>, n83 <span class='card-underline'>and the current allocation of EB-3 visas serves only a fraction of aspiring EB-3 immigrants.</span> n84 Although the intent behind these statutory restrictions is likely to recalibrate the nature of the immigrant  [*940]  flow, n85 the result is a near trainwreck of supply and demand curves. <span class='card-underline'>Rather than abandoning all intention of emigrating and remaining in their home countries, immigrants who would otherwise be EB-3s are more likely to violate border policies and pursue U.S. employment opportunities outside of the law.</span> n86</p><p>EB immigration law largely attempts to restrict entry to all but the most elite, but the policy carries significant negative externalities. <span class='card-underline'>By extracting the highly educated and highly skilled from nations around the globe, it </span><span class='card-underline'>stifles international development</span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> Thus, <span class='card-underline'>populations remain relatively unskilled and opportunities in sending countries remain limited. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>These unskilled, aspiring immigrants develop the logical desire to immigrate to the</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>U</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>nited </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>S</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>tates </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>and, undaunted by tight restrictions on their visa category, arrive without authorization</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.

(This someone is usually on Twitter.) The criticism both is and isn’t correct. It’s true that a lot of people ignore the policies behind their sewage systems and water pipes. And <span class='card-underline'>most of us — </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>voters</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>politicians</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, data-driven websites — </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>spend far more time debating </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>national politics</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> than</span></span><span class='card-underline'> the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>state</span></span> (or local) <span class='card-underline'>varieties</span>. Yet it’s also true that, in the last few years, we’ve talked a ton about state issues. Voter ID laws, abortion restrictions, minimum wage hikes, legalized marijuana, gun control, LGBT rights — each of these is an exhaustively covered example of state politics. In 2016, then, the most interesting thing about our state politics is how these two strands, the everyday and the ideological, intersect. State politicians are becoming more partisan and more polarized, much like national politicians. But this party-driven approach isn’t just influencing left-right issues like abortion or guns. It’s spreading through every part of state government, with surprising and potentially troubling results. It’s why Fairview’s water pipes haven’t been fixed — for reasons that have little to do with water, oil or even Montana itself. Before we dive into the states and their political divide, allow me a bipartisan caveat. The examples I’m highlighting will center on Republicans, because Republicans have become more extreme at the state level, just like at the national level, and because state Republicans are cleaning up: The GOP currently controls 68 of 981 state legislative chambers and 31 of the 50 governorships. One can imagine a future where Democrats create a similar ruckus. But for now, most state policies come from Republicans. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Those policies </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>influence </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>every part of our</span></span><span class='card-underline'> day-to-day </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>lives</span></span>. Start with the obvious ones — <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>roads</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>utilities</span></span>, of course, but also <span class='card-underline'>health care</span>, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>education</span></span> and <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>taxes</span></span> (tobacco, gas, property, sales, income, etc.). <span class='card-underline'>The state you live in determines tort law, contract law and a big chunk of criminal law</span>. If you live in Connecticut, for instance, you’d need to steal $2,000 worth of goods for it to count as a felony; cross over to Massachusetts and that threshold drops to $250. With more serious crimes, the state you live in can determine whether you’re eligible for post-conviction DNA analysis or even for the death penalty. <span class='card-underline'>The state you live in determines whether you can request a physician-assisted suicide. It can determine how long you stay on food stamps; it can determine the type of fireworks you buy</span>. The state you live in determines whether your teenager receives abstinence-only sex education; it also determines whether the teenager driving in the other lane is allowed to text in the car. Although some of these policies are divisive, far more are essential and mundane. In fact, for each new law Congress passes, states pass more than 75 of their own. Those laws loom even larger when we remember that fewer and fewer Americans move. According to the 2010 American Community Survey, six in ten Americans were born in their current state of residence. Your state shapes your world, especially if you can’t (or don’t want to) leave. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Despite the impact</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>of state politics</span></span>, <span class='card-underline'>most </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Americans neglect them</span></span>. <span class='card-underline'>This starts with the </span><span class='card-underline'>professionals</span>. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>From</span></span><span class='card-underline'> 20</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>03</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> to</span></span><span class='card-underline'> 20</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>14</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>local newspapers lost a third of their</span></span><span class='card-underline'> full-time </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>statehouse reporters</span></span> (overall <span class='card-underline'>staffing decreased at the same time</span>); <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>86</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>percent of local TV stations lack a</span></span><span class='card-underline'> single </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>statehouse reporter</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Even if there were</span></span><span class='card-underline'> more </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>coverage, </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>it’s not clear</span></span><span class='card-underline'> that readers or </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>viewers would</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>notice</span></span>. One 2012 survey of Tennessee adults found that <span class='card-underline'>only 12 percent said they followed state politics “very closely”; 36 percent said they followed them “fairly closely</span>.” But <span class='card-underline'>only </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>one in five respondents could name their statehouse rep</span></span><span class='card-underline'>resentative</span>. Now, to be fair, conjuring up your state rep can be tricky, and <span class='card-underline'>pollsters have found similarly anemic identification rates in other states dating to the 1960s</span>. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>A</span></span><span class='card-underline'> simpler </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>measure</span></span><span class='card-underline'> of awareness </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is to ask voters to </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>identify the party that controls their state’s</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>legislature</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. </span>Even here, though, <span class='card-underline'>the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>results are </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>lackluster</span></span>. When the American National Election Studies’ Evaluations of Government and Society Study asked this question in 2010, 47 percent of registered voters got it right, far fewer than got it right for Congress.</p><p></p><p><span class='card-underline'>This apathy spills over to the pool of potential candidates for office</span>. Take Georgia, a longtime red state that for a while seemed like it might turn purple or even blue with Donald Trump on the GOP ticket. Even if Democrats do well there on Nov. 8, they won’t capitalize in the state legislature — 80 <span class='card-underline'>percent of Georgia’s incumbents face no challenger this fall. </span>That’s the good news for incumbents everywhere. Here’s the bad: <span class='card-underline'>if more than half of voters don’t know who runs the statehouse, then those same </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>voters</span></span><span class='card-underline'> also </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>don’t know whom to reward (or</span></span><span class='card-underline'> to </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>blame</span></span><span class='card-underline'>)</span>. The best place to see this is in the research of Steven Rogers, a political scientist at St. Louis University who specializes in state legislatures. <span class='card-underline'>Rogers has analyzed decades of data across dozens of states</span>. He’s tested various factors to see how they might influence voters: <span class='card-underline'>the state’s economy, tax rates, homicide rate and student reading scores, among others</span>. What Rogers has found is that these measures <span class='card-underline'>have little or no effect on whether a state legislator wins re-election</span>. Instead, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>state races correlate</span></span><span class='card-underline'> largely </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>with presidential politics</span></span> — <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>whether</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the voter approves of the president and whether the legislator belongs to the president’s party</span></span>. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Crafting great (or terrible) legislation</span></span> on jobs or criminal sentencing <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>doesn’t</span></span><span class='card-underline'> seem to </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>matter</span></span>. “Whether or not state legislators are elected,” Rogers said, “has very little to do with them.” The most surprising thing about Rogers’s findings is their consistency. The proportion of seats a party wins in the U.S. House overlaps to an uncanny degree with the proportion of seats it wins in the state houses, and this national-local link stretches back to World War I. In other words, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>it’s not just that</span></span><span class='card-underline'> most </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>voters ignore</span></span><span class='card-underline'> what’s happening at </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the state level</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>— it’s that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>they’ve ignored it for a century</span></span> or more. The problem is that while the voting patterns haven’t changed, the national parties have. What’s happened to the national parties is a bleak and well-known story: Washington, D.C. has become more extreme, more polarized and more driven by negative partisanship. Now that partisanship is oozing into state capitals. For most of the 20th century, state government remained plodding and traditional, animated more by fixing problems than by prosecuting beliefs.2 Voters saw little difference when electing Democrats or Republicans, state by state, and most of the big policy changes came from the federal government (the New Deal) or the courts (Brown v. Board of Education). Together, the states drifted slowly to the left, helped by steadily increasing federal grants. In the 1980s and 1990s, though, state politics changed. Recently, political scientists have started to build tools that analyze trends at the state level. One team has compiled thousands of legislative votes and used them to track changes in the ideology of state legislatures, similar to what DW-NOMINATE does for Congress. Another team has assembled a data set of nearly 150 individual policies and used it to chart each state’s policy outcomes since 1936. These tools make it possible to compare states to each other and to their past selves, and in both cases it’s clear that over the last couple of decades states and their legislators have become more ideologically consistent and more ideologically extreme. For the first time in modern state politics, Republican governments started passing mostly conservative agendas, and Democratic governments started passing mostly liberal agendas. No one is quite sure why polarization and partisanship are rising at the state level, just like no one’s quite sure at the national level. But some state and local politicians started cribbing their national parties’ tactics and rhetoric. Sarah Palin, for example, ran to be a small-town mayor in 1996 before she was a governor and vice presidential nominee. When she ran for the top job in Wasilla, Alaska, the most pressing local issues were paving dirt roads and creating a police department. Yet Palin campaigned on national issues, with mailers that highlighted her anti-abortion-rights stance and ads that proclaimed she was “Endorsed by the NRA.” <span class='card-underline'>But there’s one key difference between the states and D.C. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>At the national level, gridlock has slowed both sides. In</span></span><span class='card-underline'> the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>states</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, where voters and legislators are more clearly sorted, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>there’s</span></span><span class='card-underline'> often </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>less obstruction</span></span>. Money and energy have moved to the states. <span class='card-underline'>Legislatures are getting more lobbyists</span>. (Mylan, the infamous EpiPen manufacturer, upped the number of states it lobbied from nine to 45 in a four-year span.) States have attracted more partisan outfits, as well. More than 1,000 state legislators have signed the state version of Grover Norquist’s “no taxes” pledge. State reps now go to the floor and read NRA talking points verbatim. The American Legislative Exchange Council, which pushes pro-business “model bills” in statehouses around the country, seems stronger than ever. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Because this</span></span> activity <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is happening</span></span><span class='card-underline'> in the states</span>, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>it gets less scrutiny from</span></span><span class='card-underline'> the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>media and</span></span><span class='card-underline'> less attention from </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>voters</span></span>. But there’s no question that our states are changing. While both sides are becoming more extreme, state Republicans are moving further to the right than state Democrats are moving to the left. According to the DW-NOMINATE-style tool, 18 state legislatures are now more conservative than Congress, some of them drastically so. The latest data suggests that 26 state legislatures were more polarized than Congress in 2013.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Trump <span class='card-underline'>wouldn’t care</span> enough to spin the plan---he only pays attention to <span class='card-underline'>mainstream media</span> and is <span class='card-underline'>clueless</span> about state politics.</div><div class='cite'>Elliot 17.

The House, where spending bills have to start, is preparing to release a draft of the tax plan Wednesday, with a committee rewrite slated for the following Monday. The Senate will take its red pen to it the week of Nov. 13 and have a floor vote on Nov. 20. The rapid pace is ambitious, for sure, but there are many pitfalls on its path. After all, this would be the most ambitious rewrite of the tax code since 1986. For his part, Speaker Paul Ryan recognized the pitfalls when asked about the state and local taxes on Thursday. “This budget that we just passed, that is really important for getting tax reform done,” he told reporters, painting it as merely one step in the process. “The Ways and Means Committee will be putting out the specific plan very shortly and they’re going to work with all of our members to look at, and consider and address their concerns.” But with lawmakers from states with high local taxes standing against what to them is a de facto tax hike, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the White House seemed only to rely on what cable news was saying</span></span>. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>President has</span></span><span class='card-underline'> long </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>thrived</span></span><span class='card-underline'> on </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>tapping into</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and, often, exacerbating </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the narrative on the </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>minute-by-minute coverage from the macro level</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> Yet sometimes <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>he</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>has understood the national mood so well he misses</span></span><span class='card-underline'> the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>local needs</span></span>. For instance, <span class='card-underline'>instead of holding a campaign-style victory event on Thursday, he met with families impacted by the opioid crisis in the White House’s East Room</span>. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>That disconnect between the President’s enthusiasm and local lawmakers’</span></span><span class='card-underline'> micro-level hesitancy </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>has been on display before. </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>On</span></span><span class='card-underline'> questions such as repealing </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Obamacare</span></span> and building a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border, many from the President’s own party balked. For instance, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Senators from states with thousands of constituents with</span></span><span class='card-underline'> health </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>coverage</span></span><span class='card-underline'> because of the health care law </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>weren’t eager to toss them from programs</span></span>. And border-state Senators, like Jeff Flake and John McCain, understood a brick-and-mortar garrison along the southern border spelled bad politics back home. Heading into next week, the President may again find his agenda stymied by parochial interests, and not just on the tax proposals. The Senate Banking Committee is scheduled to take up the nomination of Scott Garrett to lead the Export-Import Bank, an economic powerhouse that helps U.S. manufacturers looking to sell their goods abroad. Critics from across the spectrum have faulted the New Deal relic as corporate cronyism and a handout to some of the nation’s biggest corporations. Trump was a critic of the institution as a candidate. He called it “featherbedding” during the campaign. “When you think about free enterprise, it’s not really free enterprise,” Trump said at the time. Then, after meeting with CEOs who rely on Ex-Im funding for sales abroad, he switched gears and nominated Garrett. Allies said he saw the big picture beyond the slagging the bank took in conservative press and on Twitter. The nominee, a former Congressman from New Jersey, is no fan of the institution he has been tapped to lead. (In fact, it’s a common trait within the Cabinet, as this week’s TIME Magazine reports in its cover story.) The pick brought groans from throughout the Senate because it either gave new life to the institution or issued its death warrant depending on where one sat. Should Garrett hobble the bank or leave it impotent, that could cost jobs for states with major manufacturers who use its powers. For instance, Republican Sen. Tim Scott represents South Carolina, where Boeing has a huge footprint. Scott has a seat on the Banking Committee, where Republicans have only a one-seat advantage. It won’t be an easy week for Scott as he considers an institution that House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling of Texas routinely calls “the Bank of Boeing.” Scott, for instance, has faced lobbying to reject that nomination, especially from the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce and other groups that benefit from Boeing’s economic power in the state. The National Association of Manufacturers also has run ads urging Scott to ditch Garrett. Yet, if Scott rejects Garrett, the bank stays in neutral and Boeing loses out. The Ex-Im bank’s board has lacked a quorum since 2015, meaning it can’t cut deals worth more than $10 million. If backers of the lending organization want it to get back to work, lawmakers need to confirm Garrett. But in doing so, they’re installing someone who has railed against the institution’s very mission. Complicating politics further has been a concerted effort among groups on the left to highlight earlier comments attributed to Garrett about LGBT rights. Some of Garrett’s potential supporters were left uneasy about elevating him to the new role and giving tacit endorsement of comments, some of which he said were misattributed or misconstrued. That record has made Democrats less willing to hold their nose in order to revive the bank.

But </span><span class='card-underline'>that idea has become outdated.</span><span class='card-underline'> </span>"With today's highly nationalized political behavior, Americans are no longer taking full advantage of federalism<span class='card-underline'>. Contemporary Americans are markedly more engaged with national politics than with the state or local politics</span>," Hopkins says. "<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>We now know more about national politics</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, vote more often in national elections </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>and let our national loyalties dictate our down-ballot choices</span></span><span class='card-underline'>."</span> The book presents evidence about Americans' voting and political engagement and offers two reasons to explain why today's voters are paying more attention to federal elections. The first, Hopkins says, is a landscape in which the political parties offer similar choices at the national level. "Just as an Egg McMuffin is the same in any McDonald's, America's two major political parties are increasingly perceived to offer the same choices throughout the country," Hopkins says. The second reason is the <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>changes in the media</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and how Americans get their news, an environment that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>allow</span></span><span class='card-underline'>s </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>people to follow their interests in national-level politics, making l</span></span><span class='card-underline'>ocal and </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>state-level politics easy to ignore</span></span>, he says. "As Americans transition from print newspapers and local television news to the Internet and cable television, <span class='card-underline'>they are also leaving behind the media sources most likely to provide state and local information</span>," Hopkins says. "The result <span class='card-underline'>is a </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>growing mismatch between</span></span><span class='card-underline'> the varied challenges facing </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>states and voters'</span></span><span class='card-underline'> near-</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>exclusive focus on national politics</span></span><span class='card-underline'>." </span>For The Increasingly United States, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Hopkins examined historical and </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>recent surveys from the 50 states</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>, </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>along with election results</span></span><span class='card-underline'> from gubernatorial and mayoral races dating back nearly a century.</span> He also traced the evolution of political media coverage from The Los Angeles Times' coverage during the Great Depression through the expansion of local television news during the 1960s and the role of social media today.

Voters have cast their ballots on topics ranging from same-sex marriage and gambling to education, energy, election reform, and taxes. Eminent domain, the minimum wage, abortion, government finances, and animal rights were other subjects that occupied voters’ attention. This study focuses on four issue areas, most of which were considered in multiple states and targeted federal policy either by responding to perceived inaction or by challenging federal law. The Minimum Wage Until the newly elected Democratic Congress tackled the issue in early 2007, the federal government had not enacted a minimum wage increase since 1997, when it was raised to five dollars and fifteen cents an hour. Not content to wait for the federal government to act on what they perceived to be an important issue, in 2006 voters in six states (Nevada, Arizona, Ohio, Colorado, Missouri, and Montana) ratified initiatives to increase the minimum wage and index it to inflation, in some cases overwhelmingly. Eleven state legislatures approved raises in 2006 as well. The average ‘‘yes’’ vote for the 2006 ballot measures was 66 percent, and the average margin of victory was thirty-one points. In 2004, voters in Florida and Nevada overwhelmingly supported minimum wage ballot measures. In total, the National Conference of State Legislatures (2007b) reports that thirty states and the District of Columbia have adopted state minimum wages that are higher than the federal minimum wage. Clearly, despite inaction at the federal level there is much support for raising the minimum wage among both state voters and elected officials, including Democratic and some Republican governors and legislators. The ballot presence of hot-button issues such as same-sex marriage and the minimum wage has led scholars to investigate the mobilizing effects of these issues (Abramowitz 2004; Smith 2006; Nicholson 2005) and to uncover evidence of initiatives’ educative and electoral spillover effects. Smith and Tolbert, among the first to study the educative effects of direct democracy, found that initiative use is associated with increases in voter turnout, civic engagement, political interest, and political knowledge (Tolbert and Smith 2006; Smith and Tolbert 2004). Smith and Tolbert (2001), Kousser and McCubbins (2005), and others document the spillover effects of ballot initiatives on broader electoral and political processes such as citizens’ voting behavior in candidate elections and political party and interest group strategies. Smith (2006) notes that political officials (such as Arnold Schwarzenegger) and party operatives have skillfully used the initiative process to advance their policy agendas, threaten the legislature into action, and frame candidate elections. Smith, DeSantis, and Kassel (2006) find a positive correlation between support for anti-same-sex marriage measures and the vote for George W. Bush in Ohio and Michigan in 2004. Kousser and McCubbins (2005) describe how Democratic party activists in Colorado helped sponsor a successful 2004 initiative to increase mass transit funding that contributed to high voter turnout and Democratic victories in an election when Republican candidates dominated in many other states. In a wide-ranging study, Nicholson (2005) finds that ballot measures have agenda-setting, priming, and electoral spillover effects, altering the weight voters assign to various issues, the standards by which they evaluate candidates for congressional and gubernatorial offices, and the strategies of political candidates and parties. No longer the exclusive domain of citizens or interest groups, political party organizations, candidates, and elected officials now use initiative elections for many purposes: To increase voter registration and turnout, advance their political agendas and ideologies, circumvent contribution and expenditure limits in candidate races, selectively mobilize support for their own candidates, prime vote choice for issues on which they believe they have an advantage, or drive a wedge in opponent coalitions (Smith 2005, 2006; Kousser and McCubbins 2005; Smith and Tolbert 2001). As candidates and parties seek initiative success for policy or ideological reasons, they also force their opponents to drain their resources in attempting to defeat initiatives that run counter to their own policy and political goals. The minimum wage ballot measures that experienced overwhelming success in 2004 and 2006 were part of a concerted effort by progressive activists to mobilize sympathetic voters and sway candidate elections. Support for Florida’s 2004 minimum wage initiative by the Association of Community Organization for Reform Now (ACORN) led to the adoption of the measure as well as a successful voter registration drive. The group appeared to achieve its goals of ‘‘‘driving heightened Democratic turnout, passing the initiative, and building permanent political capacity for future gains’’’ (quoted in Kousser and McCubbins 2005, 973). In 2004 progressive activists in Nevada and Florida, with the approval of the Democratic National Committee, used focus groups and pre-election surveys to pretest the language of a variety of minimum wage proposals. They selected those they believed would mobilize low-income voters who would also support Democratic candidates, including presidential nominee John Kerry (Smith 2006). In 2006, the belief that minimum wage ballot initiatives could mobilize Democratic-leaning voters was an attractive possibility for labor unions (particularly the AFL-CIO, which launched its ‘‘America Needs a Raise’’ campaign that year) and other progressive groups such as ACORN interested in unseating the Republican congressional leadership (Broder 2006; Andrews 2006). The objectives of minimum wage sponsors, then, were manifold, including bringing about both state and federal policy change, boosting voter registration and turnout, and influencing candidate elections. Even before they appeared on state ballots and in Congress, <span class='card-underline'>proposals to increase the minimum wage received high levels of support in public opinion polls</span> (Roper Center 2007, 55). Democrats in Congress are certainly more sympathetic to a minimum wage increase than are most Republicans, and it is not surprising that they would choose to address the issue as one of their signature initiatives in the 110th Congress in early 2007. Still, the evidence presented here suggests that supporters of raising the minimum wage were able to simultaneously achieve three objectives: <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Advocates took </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>independent state-level action</span></span><span class='card-underline'> to address a policy issue of public concern</span>; they had a hand in helping to bring about an electoral majority in Congress more favorable to increasing the minimum wage; and their efforts led to increased turnout (if not Democratic victories) in at least some of the states where the measures appeared. <span class='card-underline'>As predicted, the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>success</span></span><span class='card-underline'> of minimum wage initiatives </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>in</span></span><span class='card-underline'> multiple </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>states</span></span> during the 2004–2006 election cycle <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>ultimately resulted in</span></span><span class='card-underline'> intergovernmental policy </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>consensus.

Section I of the Fourteenth Amendment, also known as the Citizenship Clause or the Naturalization Clause, dictates that <span class='card-underline'>federal citizens are citizens of the states in which they reside</span>. Specifically, it provides: "All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside." 6 By its plain language, however, <span class='card-underline'>the amendment sets a floor, not a ceiling, for state citizenship. That is, it defines a class of people-U.S. citizenswho must be deemed state citizens, but it does not purport to limit the discretion of states to extend state citizenship more broadly to additional classes of people</span>. The historical context in which the amendment was enacted and subsequent judicial interpretations of the amendment confirm that the power of states to extend their citizenship to nonfederal citizens endured after the passage of the Reconstruction Amendments.</p><p>Following the end of the Civil War in 1865, the Reconstruction Amendments were enacted, in part to overrule the Supreme Court's conclusion in Dred Scott that persons of African descent could not be citizens of the United States.6 7 However, in addition to creating a clear definition of federal citizen ship, as <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the Supreme Court has explained, the Fourteenth Amendment was also intended to "preclude any effort by state legislatures to circumvent the Amendment by denying freedmen state citizenship</span></span>."6S As explained by Senator Howard at the time of its passage:</p><p>The great object of the first section of this amendment is, therefore, to restrain the power of the States and compel them at all times to respect these great fundamental guarantees.... .... It will, if adopted by the States, forever disable every one of them from passing laws trenching upon those fundamental rights and privileges which pertain to citizens of the United States, and to all persons who may happen to be within their jurisdiction.</p><p>Accordingly, consistent with the plain language, <span class='card-underline'>the intent of the Fourteenth Amendment was to prevent states from denying rights to marginalized communities and persons-former slaves in particular-rather than to prevent states from advancing inclusive constructions of state citizenship or extending rights and protections more broadly than the federal government</span>. o</p><p>In the years after the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the Supreme Court reaffirmed the remaining autonomy of the states in defining their own political communities</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> Most notably, in the Slaughter-House Cases, wherein the Supreme Court was first called upon to interpret the Fourteenth Amendment, <span class='card-underline'>the Court specifically discussed the distinction between state and federal citizenship, as set forth in the Citizenship Clause. </span>7 ' The issue in the opinion related to the breadth and interpretation of the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, but insofar as that clause protects "privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States," <span class='card-underline'>the Court drew a sharp distinction between state and federal citizenship</span>. 72 It explained that "<span class='card-underline'>the distinction between citizenship of the United States and citizenship of a State is clearly recognized and established" and that "[i]t is quite clear, then, that there is a citizenship of the United States, and a citizenship of a State, which are distinct from each other, and which depend upon different characteristics or circumstances in the individual</span>." Moreover, the Court noted that <span class='card-underline'>the rights belonging to individuals as citizens of a state "have always been held to be the class of rights which the State governments were created to establish and secure"-thus acknowledging the power of states to define the rights and privileges </span><span class='card-underline'>of their own citizenship</span>. 74 While the Court's narrow interpretation of the Privileges and Immunities Clause has been sharply criticized,7 it nevertheless remains good law. More importantly, the critiques do not stain the Court's distinction between state and federal citizenship.</p><p>In Boyd v. Nebraska ex rel Thayer, the Court reaffirmed the power of the states to define the boundaries of their own citizenry as that ower relates to the axiomatic principle embodied in the Tenth Amendment -that the federal government has only limited enumerated powers and that all powers not explicitly granted to the federal government are reserved to the states. 77 As the Court explained:</p><p>[<span class='card-underline'>P]revious to the adoption of the constitution of the United States, every state had the undoubted right to confer on whomsoever it pleased the character of citizen, and to endow him with all its rights. . . .[T]he several states [did not] surrender[] the power of conferring these rights and privileges by adopting the constitution of the United States. [Thus, e]ach state may still confer them</span> upon an alien or any one it thinks proper, or upon any class or description of persons. . .</p><p>In United States v. Cruikshank, the Court dismissed a federal criminal indictment alleging that members of a white militia that killed a group of African Americans were criminally liable for violating various rights enshrined in the Constitution.79 The decision was premised, in large part, on a now-rejected theory that the rights protected by the Bill of Rights operate only against the federal government. Nevertheless, in so holding, the Court had occasion to reaffirm and opine at length regarding the separate and autonomous political systems of the federal and state governments, the distinct statuses of state and federal citizenship, and each government's respective supremacy within its own realm. 80</p><p>Similarly, in Colgate v. Harvey, the Court again addressed the scope of the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, this time as it applied to a state tax scheme that treated certain economic activity differently depending on whether it occurred within or outside the state.81 In the course of its decision, and in explaining the distinction between the Privileges and Immunities Clauses of Article IV and of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Court again reaffirmed the distinct and separate character of the citizenship schemes of the state and federal governments. 82</p><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The enduring power of states to define the boundaries of their own political community has also been reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in the modem era</span></span>. In Oregon v. Mitchell, where the Court considered and rejected the power of Congress to force states to enfranchise eighteen-year-olds in state elections, the Court explained that "<span class='card-underline'>the Fourteenth Amendment was [not] intended to strip the States of their power, carefully preserved in the original Constitution, to govern themselves.</span>"" Again in U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, <span class='card-underline'>the Court held that states may not impose qualifications for the offices of U.S. Representatives or Senators in addition to those set forth by the Constitution. In his concurrence, Justice Kennedy explained:</span></p><p><span class='card-underline'>The Framers split the atom of sovereignty. It was the genius of their idea that our citizens would have two political capacities, one state and one federal, each protected from incursion by the other.

First, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>state citizenship laws, unlike anti-immigrant state laws, would exercise a power that the federalist structure of the Constitution necessarily vests in the states; a power that Congress is not constitutionally authorized to preempt</span></span>. Second, unlike anti-immigrant state laws, <span class='card-underline'>a properly drafted state citizenship law would not conflict or interfere with the federal immigration scheme insofar as it would not seek to regulate who may stay and who must leave the United States-the exclusive province of the federal government</span>.</p><p>A. The Limits of Congressional Preemptive Power over State Citizenship Schemes</p><p>As discussed above in Part LB, the federal government may only act and, consequently, Congress may only legislate in those realms enumerated in the Constitution.8 8 The Supremacy Clause declares that the "Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land." 8 9 Thus only laws made pursuant to the Constitution have preemptive force. <span class='card-underline'>Because the power to control state citizenship</span>,90 <span class='card-underline'>within the boundaries of the Fourteenth Amendment, is among those powers reserved in the Constitution to the states</span> 9 1 -<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>a power over which Congress has no power to legislate-Congress</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>cannot preempt</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>a state from passing a law granting state citizenship to nonfederal citizens</span></span>.9 2</p><p>However, <span class='card-underline'>while Congress is impotent to control the boundaries of state citizenship, this merely prompts the question of what rights states can attach to their citizenship and, among those rights, which Congress can proscribe</span>. 3 Put another way, <span class='card-underline'>when Congress acts pursuant to its constitutionally vested authority, what limits, if any, exist regarding the restraints it may impose upon the rights states can grant to their citizens? How do we balance the constitutionally assigned powers of Congress against the constitutionally protected sovereignty of the states?</span> 94 To understand the constraints on federal power in this realm we must first understand the purpose behind the federalist structure guaranteed by the Constitution.9 5 As the Supreme Court has explained, federalism "preserves to the people numerous advantages":</p><p>[1] It assures a decentralized government that will be more sensitive to the diverse needs of a heterogenous society; [2) it increases opportunity for citizen involvement in democratic processes; [3] it allows for more innovation and experimentation in government; and [4] it makes government more responsive by putting the States in competition for a mobile citizenry.</p><p>As an initial matter, it is worth noting that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>it is difficult to imagine a state initiative more closely aligned with these values than the contemplated inclusive state citizenship schemes.</span></span><span class='card-underline'> Extending state citizenship to immigrants is, of course, an "innovati[ve] and experimentati[ve]" initiative intended to make government "more sensitive to the diverse needs of a heterogenous society," and "</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>it increases opportunity for citizen involvement in democratic processes</span></span><span class='card-underline'>" while putting "States in competition for a mobile citizenry."</span> 97 As a general rule, "[a]s long as it is acting within the powers granted it under the Constitution, Congress may im ose its will on the States" even "in areas traditionally regulated by the States." Accordingly, as a default, the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution dictates that when congressional power and state sovereignty come in conflict, state sovereignty must give way.99 But for decades, the Supreme Court has recognized that there are limits to this general principle.</p><p>In Sugarman v. Dougall, the Court was called upon to decide whether a New York state statute, which prohibited the employment of noncitizens in a broad range of public positions, including primarily low-level nonpolicymaking positions, violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution.100 The Court held that the statute violated the guarantee of equal protection and rejected the State's claim that the employment prohibition was an exercise of the State's sovereign authority to define the identity of its own government. However, in considering the issue, the Court "recognize[d] a State's interest in establishing its own form of government, and in limiting participation in that government to those who are within 'the basic conception of a political community"' as well as "the State's broad power to define its political cormmunity." t o 1 Most notably, the Court explained that if the statute had implicated "functions that [went] to the heart of representative government," the Court's equal protection scrutiny would not have been "so demanding where we deal[t] with matters resting firmly within a State's constitutional prerogatives."l02 This is a truly extraordinary statement. The Court here indicates that even where constitutional mandates come into conflict with fundamental aspects of state sovereignty, let alone statutory proscriptions, those constitutional rules must sometimes bend out of respect for the power constitutionally reserved to states. 103 It seems the default rule, set forth in the Supremacy Clause, is not absolute,</p><p>Just a few years later, in National League of Cities v. Usery, the Court established the high-water mark for the inviolability of state sovereignty.1 04 In National League of Cities, the Court held that Congress may not exercise its commerce power to interfere with state sovereignty "in areas of traditional governmental functions." 105 This rule was short-lived, however, as nine years later, in Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, the Court abandoned this rule, holding that the "traditional governmental functions" test was unworkable.106 In Garcia, the Court acknowledged that there are undoubtedly limits on the power of Congress to exercise its commerce power so as to infringe on state sovereignty, but it expressed doubt "that courts ultimately can identify principled constitutional limitations on the scope of Congress' Cornmerce Clause powers over the States merely by relying on a priori definitions of state sovereignty." 10 7 Instead, the Court suggested that the political process, not the courts, may be the appropriate constitutional mechanism to define the boundaries of inviolable state sovereignty.10</p><p>However, most recently, in Gregory v. Ashcroft, the Court has come full circle and once again embraced the balance originally suggested in Dougall. In Gregory, the Court was considering a challenge brought by Missouri state judges, claiming that the state constitution's mandatory retirement age violated, inter alia, the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA).1 0 9 If the provision violated the ADEA, the case presented the issue of whether Congress could constitutionally interfere with a state's ability to determine the qualifications for its own judges. The Court ultimately constructed a clear statement rule to avoid the difficult constitutional issue and held that the judges were not covered by the ADEA under the language of that statute.1 to However, in so holding, the Court strongly suggested that even where Congress is constitutionally empowered to act, it may not act in a way that infringes on "state decisions that 'go to the heart of representative government"' because such infringement "would upset the usual constitutional balance of federal and state powers." 1 I</p><p>Accordingly, <span class='card-underline'>in determining what rights states may universally deliver to their citizenship and what rights the federal government may prohibit a state from delivering, we are guided by the Court's decisions in Dougall and Gregory. It seems that those rights which go most directly to the "heart of [a state's] representative government" may not be infringed upon by Congress</span>, even through the exercise of its constitutionally enumerated powers. 1 12</p><p>As discussed in greater detail below, <span class='card-underline'>the rights contemplated under an inclusive state citizenship scheme fall generally into three categories: political rights, rights of access to public programs and benefits, and rights to protection against mistreatment</span>.113 Political rights include the right to vote and hold public office. Rights of access to public programs and benefits include the rights to state-issued identification, driver's licenses, and equal access to state educational and health care programs. Finally, rights to protection against mistreatment include privacy protections, antidiscrimination protections, and assurances that the state and its subdivisions will not voluntarily participate in federal immigration enforcement activities targeting state citizens.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>The legal inquiry for each of these rights is thus whether the right goes to the "heart of representative government." Many rights may not, and thus Congress could in theory limit the ability of states to deliver these rights-though it has not.</span>114 However, <span class='card-underline'>some of the rights attendant to an inclusive state citizenship scheme are essential to a functioning democracy, and thus any attempt to federally proscribe these rights should fail.

In November, recently retired Alphabet chairman Eric Schmidt said the <span class='card-underline'>federal government needs to</span> “<span class='card-underline'>get its act together” on AI</span>.

In Washington, lawmakers say the <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>White House needs to step up its AI policy</span></span>. “We don’t have a national strategy.

Experts fear that, without action from the White House, the U.S. could lose technological ground to China. “China already has a meaningful track record — when it says it’s going to pursue something, then it makes it happen,” said Jack Clark, who oversees policy at Open AI, an artificial intelligence lab co-founded by Elon Musk. In July, China released a statement saying it would give serious attention to AI with the goal of becoming the world leader in AI by 2030. <span class='card-underline'>Even if China doesn’t overtake the U.S.</span>, though, experts in the American AI community think the <span class='card-underline'>U.S. could still lose</span> a <span class='card-underline'>large chunk of global market share</span> in terms of both AI development and talent to the Chinese. “The amount of rhetorical support you give AI is meaningful,” Clark said. “The market and talent for AI is global. These people are going to go to institutions in countries which are showing support for it.” While <span class='card-underline'>China’s play at AI dominance</span> is still in its early stages, <span class='card-underline'>it’s already having an effect</span>. Chinese research submissions to AI conferences have already ramped up significantly, while investment in Chinese AI work and patent filings are also on the rise. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>U.S. AI experts</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> say</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>there is still time</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>for</span></span><span class='card-underline'> the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>federal government to back AI investments</span></span>. “There’s a real risk of losing our edge on AI, but <span class='card-underline'>there is still </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>plenty</span></span> of <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>opportunity for</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>the <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>U.S. government to act</span></span>,” said Dean Garfield, president of the Information Technology Industry Council, a trade association that lobbies on behalf of tech giants. Garfield, who said he’s in regular contact with the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy, says the White House is working on artificial intelligence even if the administration doesn’t say much about it. “I don’t think that they’re talking about it enough, and they’re not outlining a clear strategy that would give people reason to be confident,” he said. “The critique I have is that they need to talk about it and share it more broadly, so that the private sector and academia can contribute as well.” Academics say they feel like <span class='card-underline'>AI research isn’t getting enough funding</span> <span class='card-underline'>from the government. </span>“[The <span class='card-underline'>government] is not investing enough</span>. The amount that’s coming in is very small,” said Pedros Domingos, a professor at the University of Washington who specializes in machine learning. For its part, the White House rejects the premise that it’s not doing enough on AI. Instead, the administration says that it has a strategy in the works. “<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>To maintain</span></span><span class='card-underline'> American </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>leadership</span></span> <span class='card-underline'>in a</span>rtificial <span class='card-underline'>i</span>ntelligence, the <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>U.S. will continue to propel</span></span> our <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>nation’s [r</span></span><span class='card-underline'>esearch </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>and d</span></span><span class='card-underline'>evelopment] </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>ecosystem</span></span>,” Michael Kratsios, the head of the Office of Science and Technology Policy at the White House, said in a statement. <span class='card-underline'>Kratsios said</span> the <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>White House will prioritize</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>research funding</span></span> in academia “and work in partnership with the private sector” <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>to bolster U.S. innovation in AI</span></span>.

But many in the AI industry and academia are puzzled by what they see as federal disinterest in AI. “If you look at the ‘America first’ priorities of the Trump administration, this should play very well with them,” Domingos said. “This is about making the U.S. competitive economically and militarily.”</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Advantage sustainable---no time frame argument</div><div class='cite'>Louise Lucas and Richard Waters 18 – Lucas, covers tech for FT in Asia.

For example, in 2017, the National Science Foundation funded over 6,500 graduate students in computer-related fields and has launched several new initiatives designed to encourage data and computer science at all levels from pre-K to higher and continuing education.[57] <span class='card-underline'>The </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>goal is to build a</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>larger pipeline of AI</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>and </span><span class='card-underline'>data analytic </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>personnel</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>so</span></span> that the <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>U</span></span>nited <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>S</span></span>tates <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>can reap</span></span><span class='card-underline'> the</span> full <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>advantages of</span></span><span class='card-underline'> the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>knowledge revolution</span></span>. But there also needs to be substantial changes in the process of learning itself. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>It is not just</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>technical skills</span></span> <span class='card-underline'>that are needed</span> in an AI world <span class='card-underline'>but skills of critical reasoning, collaboration, design, visual display of information, and independent thinking, among others</span>.

Having already spent billions on research programs, China is readying a new multibillion-dollar initiative to fund moonshot projects, start-ups and academic research, all with the aim of growing China’s A.I. capabilities, according to two professors who consulted with the government on the plan. China’s private companies are pushing deeply into the field as well, though the line between government and private in China sometimes blurs. Baidu — often called the Google of China and a pioneer in artificial-intelligence-related fields, like speech recognition — this year opened a joint company-government laboratory partly run by academics who once worked on research into Chinese military robots. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>China is spending more</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> just as</span></span> the <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>U</span></span>nited <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>S</span></span>tates <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>cuts back</span></span>. This past week, the <span class='card-underline'>Trump</span> administration <span class='card-underline'>released a proposed budget</span> that <span class='card-underline'>would slash funding for</span> a variety of <span class='card-underline'>government agencies</span> that have <span class='card-underline'>traditionally backed a</span>rtificial <span class='card-underline'>i</span>ntelligence <span class='card-underline'>research</span>. “It’s a race in the new generation of computing,” said James Lewis, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “The <span class='card-underline'>difference is that</span> <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>China seems to think it’s a race</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>and</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>America doesn’t</span></span>.” For Mr. Schwertfeger, the <span class='card-underline'>money mattered</span>. He received a grant six times larger than what he might have gotten in Europe or America. That enabled him to set up a full artificial intelligence lab, with an assistant, a technician and a group of Ph.D. students. “It’s almost impossible for assistant professors to get this much money,” he said. “The <span class='card-underline'>research funding is shrinking in</span> the <span class='card-underline'>U.S. </span>and Europe. But it is definitely expanding in China.” Mr. Schwertfeger’s lab, which is part of ShanghaiTech University, works on ways for machines, without any aid from humans, to avoid obstacles. Decked out with wheeled robots, drones and sensors, the lab works on ways for computers to make their own maps and to improve the performance of robots with tasks like finding objects — specifically, people — during search-and-rescue operations. <span class='card-underline'>Much of China’s a</span>rtificial <span class='card-underline'>i</span>ntelligence <span class='card-underline'>push is similarly</span> <span class='card-underline'>peaceful</span>. Still, its prowess and dedication have set off alarms within the United States’ defense establishment. The <span class='card-underline'>D</span>efense <span class='card-underline'>D</span>epartment <span class='card-underline'>found that</span> <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Chinese money has been pouring into American a</span></span>rtificial <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>i</span></span>ntelligence <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>companies</span></span> — <span class='card-underline'>some of the same ones</span> it had been <span class='card-underline'>looking to for future weapons systems</span>. Quantifying China’s spending push is difficult, because authorities there disclose little. But experts say it looks to be considerable. Numerous provinces and cities are spending billions on developing robotics, and a part of that funding is likely to go to artificial intelligence research. For example, the relatively unknown city of Xiangtan, in China’s Hunan province, has pledged $2 billion toward developing robots and artificial intelligence. Other places have direct incentives for the A.I. industry. In Suzhou, leading artificial intelligence companies can get about $800,000 in subsidies for setting up shop locally, while Shenzhen, in southern China, is offering $1 million to support any A.I. project established there. On a national level, China is working on a system to predict events like terrorist attacks or labor strikes based on possible precursors like labor strife. A paper funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China showed how facial recognition software can be simplified so that it can be more easily integrated with cameras across the country. <span class='card-underline'>China</span> is preparing a concerted nationwide push, according to the two professors who advised on the effort but declined to be identified, because the effort has not yet been made public. While the size wasn’t clear, they said, it <span class='card-underline'>would most likely result in billions of dollars in spending</span>. President <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Trump’s proposed budget</span></span>, meanwhile, would <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>reduce the</span></span> National Science Foundation’s <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>spending</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>on so-called intelligent systems <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>by 10 percent</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, to about $175 million</span>. <span class='card-underline'>R</span>esearch <span class='card-underline'>and d</span>evelopment in other areas <span class='card-underline'>would also be cut</span>, though the proposed budget does call for more spending on defense research and some supercomputing.

In a series of scenarios centered around the South China Sea, Taiwan and the East China Sea, Allison explored how well-established flashpoints involving China and the United States and its allies could spiral into unwanted war. Allison’s article argues that given the context of strategic rivalry between a rising power and a status-quo power, organizational and bureaucratic misjudgments increase the likelihood of unintended escalation. According to Allison, “the underlying stress created by China’s disruptive rise creates conditions in which accidental, otherwise inconsequential events could trigger a large-scale conflict.” This <span class='card-underline'>argument appears persuasive</span> on its surface, in no small part because it evokes insights from some of Allison’s groundbreaking work on the organizational pathologies that made the Cuban Missile Crisis so dangerous. However, <span class='card-underline'>Allison ultimately fails to persuade </span>because <span class='card-underline'>he fails to specify the political and strategic conditions that make war plausible in the first place</span>. Allison’s analysis implies that the United States and China are in a situation analogous to that of the Soviet Union and the United States in the early 1960s. In the Cold War example, the two countries faced each other on a near-war footing and engaged in a bitter geostrategic and ideological struggle for supremacy. The two countries experienced a series of militarized crises and fought each other repeatedly through proxy wars. It was this broader context that made issues of misjudgment so dangerous in a crisis. By contrast, the U<span class='card-underline'>.S.-China relationship today operates</span> <span class='card-underline'>at a much lower level of hostility and threat</span>. China and the United States may be experiencing an increase in tensions, but the <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>two countries remain far from</span></span><span class='card-underline'> the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>bitter</span></span>, acrimonious <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>rivalry</span></span><span class='card-underline'> that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>defined the U.S.-Soviet relationship</span></span><span class='card-underline'> in the early 1960s</span>. <span class='card-underline'>Neither Washington nor Beijing regards the other as its principal enemy</span>. Today’s rivals may view each other warily as competitors and threats on some issues, <span class='card-underline'>but they </span>also <span class='card-underline'>view each other as important trade partners and partners</span> <span class='card-underline'>on s</span>ome <span class='card-underline'>shared concerns</span>, such as North Korea, as the recent summit between President Donald Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping illustrated. The behavior of their respective militaries underscores the relatively restrained rivalry. The <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>military competition</span></span><span class='card-underline'> between China and the U</span>nited <span class='card-underline'>S</span>tates <span class='card-underline'>may be growing</span>, <span class='card-underline'>but it </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>operates at a far lower level of intensity</span></span><span class='card-underline'> than</span> the relentless <span class='card-underline'>arms racing that typified the U.S.-Soviet standoff</span>. And unlike their Cold War counterparts, U.S. and Chinese militaries are not postured to fight each other in major wars. Moreover, polls show that the people of the two countries regard each other with mixed views —a considerable contrast from the hostile sentiment expressed by the U.S. and Soviet publics for each other. Lacking both preparations for major war and a constituency for conflict, leaders and bureaucracies in both countries have less incentive to misjudge crisis situations in favor of unwarranted escalation. To the contrary, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>political leaders</span></span> and bureaucracies currently <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>face</span></span><span class='card-underline'> a </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>strong incentive to</span></span><span class='card-underline'> find ways of </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>defusing crises</span></span> in a manner <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>that avoids unwanted escalation</span></span>. This <span class='card-underline'>inclination </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>manifested itself in</span></span> the EP-3 <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>airplane collision off Hainan</span></span><span class='card-underline'> Island</span> in 2001, and in subsequent incidents involving U.S. and Chinese ships and aircraft, such as the <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>harassment of</span></span><span class='card-underline'> the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>USNS Impeccable</span></span><span class='card-underline'> in 2009</span>. This does not mean that there is no risk, however. Indeed, the potential for a dangerous militarized crisis may be growing. Moreover, key political and geostrategic developments could shift the incentives for leaders in favor of more escalatory options in a crisis and thereby make Allison’s scenarios more plausible. Past precedents offer some insight into the types of developments that would most likely propel the U.S.-China relationship into a hostile, competitive one featuring an elevated risk of conflict. The most important driver, as Allison recognizes, would be a growing parity between China and the United States as economic, technological and geostrategic leaders of the international system. The United States and China feature an increasing parity in the size of their economies, but the <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>U</span></span>nited <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>S</span></span>tates <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>retains a considerable lead</span></span> in virtually every other dimension of national power. The current U.S.-China rivalry is a regional one centered on the Asia-Pacific region, but it retains the considerable potential of escalating into a global, systemic competition down the road. A second important driver would be the mobilization of public opinion behind the view that the other country is a primary source of threat, thereby providing a stronger constituency for escalatory policies. A related development would be the formal designation by leaders in both capitals of the other country as a primary hostile threat and likely foe. These developments would most likely be fueled by a growing array of intractable disputes, and further accelerated by a serious militarized crisis. The cumulative effect would be the exacerbation of an antagonistic competitive rivalry, repeated and volatile militarized crisis, and heightened risk that any flashpoint could escalate rapidly to war—a relationship that would resemble the U.S.-Soviet relationship in the early 1960s. <span class='card-underline'>Yet even if the relationship evolved towards a more hostile form of rivalry</span>, unique <span class='card-underline'>features of the contemporary world suggest lessons drawn from the past</span> <span class='card-underline'>may have limited applicability</span>. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Economic interdependence</span></span> in the twenty-first century <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is</span></span><span class='card-underline'> much different and </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>far more complex</span></span> than in it was in the past. So is the <span class='card-underline'>lethality of weaponry available to the major powers</span>. In the sixteenth century, armies fought with pikes, swords and primitive guns. In the twenty-first century, it is possible to eliminate all life on the planet in a full-bore nuclear exchange. These features likely affect the willingness of leaders to escalate in a crisis in a manner far differently than in past rivalries. More broadly, Allison’s analysis about the “<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Thucydides Trap</span></span><span class='card-underline'>”</span> may be criticized for <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>exaggerat</span></span><span class='card-underline'>ing the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>risks of war</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>.</span> In his claims to identify a high propensity for war between “rising” and “ruling” countries, he fails to clarify those terms, and does not distinguish the more dangerous from the less volatile types of rivalries. <span class='card-underline'>Contests for supremacy over land regions</span>, for example, have historically proven the <span class='card-underline'>most conflict-prone</span>, <span class='card-underline'>while </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>competition for</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>supremacy</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>over maritime regions has</span></span>, by contrast, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>tended to be less lethal</span></span>. Rivalries also wax and wane over time, with varying levels of risks of war. A more careful review of rivalries and their variety, duration and patterns of interaction suggests that although most wars involve rivalries, many rivals avoid going to war . Misperceptions and strategic accidents remain a persistent feature of international politics, and it may well be that that mistakes are more likely to be lethal in periods of adjustment in relative power configurations. Rising states do have problems negotiating status quo changes with states that have staked out their predominance earlier. Even so, the <span class='card-underline'>probability of war between China and the United States is almost certainly far less</span> <span class='card-underline'>than the 75 percent</span> predicted by Allison. If the <span class='card-underline'>leaders of both countries</span> can <span class='card-underline'>continue to find ways to dampen the trends towards hostile rivalry and maintain sufficient cooperation</span> to manage differences, then there is good reason to hope that the risk of war can be lowered further still.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>China already has military superiority in the SCS</div><div class='cite'>Ian Bowers 17 {Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies, Centre for Asian Security Studies, PhD in War Studies from King's College London.

However, in the strategic maritime environment of the SCS where the nature of the conflict is, as described above, limited, coercive and non-existential, power asymmetry can be mitigated during everyday operations. Credibility is at the heart of deterrence; an aggressor must be convinced that an opponent is capable and willing to carry out a deterrent strategy.25 Mearsheimer, in addressing conventional deterrence on land writes that “where asymmetry is so great that the attacker does not have the slightest doubt that he will succeed on the battlefield...the concept of conventional deterrence does not apply.”26 The power differential suggests that at sea such a premise may also ring true and that the littoral nations of the SCS cannot credibly deter China’s actions in the region. However, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>China’s maritime geostrategic position and the nature of operations at sea serve to partially offset its numerical superiority in everyday operations.</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span>This is relevant, as in cases of deterrence, it is not the ratio of total capabilities but the “immediate and short–term balance of forces” in proximity to the target that has the most impact on deterrence calculations.27 As the UK discovered during the Falkland invasion, despite the possession of nuclear weapons and a relatively powerful military capability in Europe, if there are no forces to credibly impose cost at the point of attack, deterrence is more likely to fail.28 That <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>China possesses a vast superiority in terms of naval and civilian platforms is not in doub</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>t</span>.

Deterrence is a strategy designed to prevent one party from performing an unwanted action by reducing the benefits or heightening the potential costs of said action.11 In a paradigm where there is power parity, or the deterring party has superiority, a naval force will ideally develop a deterrence strategy which contains elements of both punishment and denial.12 This is the standard assumption on which naval analysts espouse the unique capacity of seapower to implement conventional deterrence.13 <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The </span></span><span class='card-underline'>forward-deployed and based </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>U.S. Navy is the most powerful naval force in the world</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span>and thus has the capacity to employ both elements. It maintains assets which can “impose unacceptable consequences on an aggressor” and “deny an adversary the physical or psychological benefits of its aggression.”14 However, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>in</span></span><span class='card-underline'> a maritime theater such as </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the SCS where the weaker side is the deterring party, the power imbalance limits the available deterrent options</span></span>. Deterrence by punishment functions on the threat of retaliation if an opponent undertakes aggressive action.15 <span class='card-underline'>It is the fear of these costs which deters unwanted action. The </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>ability to operationalize deterrence by punishment is dependent on the possession of credible capabilities sufficient to hurt an aggressor</span></span>.16 Under conditions of power asymmetry, punitive conventional naval capabilities that could sufficiently punish a larger power are beyond the capacity of smaller navies. The pursuit of such an approach is not only inefficient but is inherently risky under conditions of power asymmetry as it could provoke the larger power into pre-emptive action. Consequently<span class='card-underline'>, a weaker navy’s preferred deterrence option is deterrence by denial. Deterrence by denial concentrates on the prevention of an aggressor meeting its immediate goals</span>.17 This is enacted by “<span class='card-underline'>convincing an adversary that it cannot achieve its objectives rapidly or convincingly</span>” thereby preventing a fait accomplis and reducing the benefits of aggression.18 <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Naval forces can be deployed to increase the uncertainties and heighten the potential costs to an aggressor</span></span><span class='card-underline'> even if said military forces could not mount an effective defense</span>.19 In this case a deterrent capacity may be demonstrated in actual operations, <span class='card-underline'>when deterrence initially fails but t</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>he defensive act, even if unsuccessful, imposes sufficient costs to deter repeat occurrences or further action</span></span>.20 Despite their relative weakness, <span class='card-underline'>smaller navies can impose a denial strategy as described above. Small navies are strategically and operationally relevant when pitted against a more powerful opponent</span>.21 <span class='card-underline'>This is particularly true in littoral waters where navies can leverage geography and technology to punch above their weight and impose substantial cost on an attacking force</span>.22 Under such conditions, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>victory in battle does not have to be the primary objective; instead the smaller force can maintain capabilities which can alter an opponent’s perception regarding the advantages of aggressio</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>n</span>.23 Therefore, <span class='card-underline'>the smaller naval force can make aggression prohibitively costly at an operational level or can prolong a conflict</span> in the hope of garnering international assistance or sympathy, thereby <span class='card-underline'>raising the cost on a political level</span>.24</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Data is the only barrier to AI cybersecurity applications.</div><div class='cite'>Elise Poirier 18 {Administrative assistant at Benhamou Global Ventures, and former Operations Specialist at Baidu USA. 3-27-2018. “Applying AI to Cybersecurity – Separating Hype from Reality (Part 1).” http://benhamouglobalventures.com/2018/03/27/applying-ai-cybersecurity-separating-hype-reality-part-1/}//JM</div><div class='card-body'><p>For CISOs investing in security products marketed as “AI-driven”, it is critical to <span class='card-underline'>d</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>econstruct the hype through several key lenses of reality</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>: </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Contextual Data is King – Cybersecurity challenges are broadly design and data problems, rather than machine learning problems</span></span>. While startups may differentiate on the sophistication of their algorithms, <span class='card-underline'>the data itself is an important source of differentiation.</span> The nature of constantly evolving cyber threats dramatically increases the need for real-time intelligence flow to power ML algorithms, rather than second-hand data sets. Furthermore, as it becomes harder to detect the signal among the noise of massive data sets, solutions require that these data sets be labeled to train ML algorithms – requiring efficient processes and manpower. <span class='card-underline'>Successful startups</span> typically fall into specific categories: <span class='card-underline'>Companies with an area of a high availability of labeled samples for supervising learning data, such as Cybereason, Cylance etc. which have successfully reduced false positives and false negatives in malware identification and spam detection. Companies assembling very large, unique data sets by scanning the deep web and underground forum</span>s. 4iQ (4iQ.com), a BGV portfolio company, has built one of the largest identity threat intelligence data lakes with 13 billion breach records detected. CEO Monica Pal notes that “When it comes to the deep web, depending on what you are doing, you have to know who to talk to and where to look. When it comes to breached data, you need people with deep knowledge of the breach economy and where the activity is.” Applying ML to this data lake enables a company to more quickly cleanse, validate and ingest the data, and then send alerts to affected consumers. <span class='card-underline'>Both applications highlight the need for new ML techniques to optimize data efficiency</span>. Summary Analytics, another BGV portfolio company, uses sub-modular functions to optimally identify representative subsets of larger data sets, thereby significantly accelerating machine learning. Variation is Native to Security – In a landscape of rapidly evolving threats, trying to detect and defend against a moving target is difficult with no predictable progression of threats. In fact, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>ML-based solutions are likely to have more false positives and false negatives when large variations are pervasive throughout the underlying data se</span></span>t (e.g. when polymorphism makes every attack using same underlying malware look different) <span class='card-underline'>and when the data set cannot be deterministically labeled, cannot be easily cleaned, or is too small</span>. A low threshold for false positives is often intentional; the risk of a single false negative is so probative that most solutions are tuned to prefer more false positives.

That suggests that general-purpose AI applications like facial recognition will be the preserve of all “the big platforms”, regardless of their country of origin, says James Manyika, a partner at McKinsey. By contrast, more specialised applications could be perfected where the data are the richest. When it comes to manufacturing, for instance, China is “collecting a lot more data”, he says.

A major cyber attack could cut off electrical power, resulting in “people dying from heat or cold exposure, etc.,” said Granger Morgan, co-director of the Carnegie Mellon Electricity Industry Center and one of the chairs of the report. “A large outage of long duration could cover many states and last for weeks or longer. Whether and how many casualties there could be would depend on things like what the weather was during the outage.” It’s a huge problem but not an event resulting in tens of thousands of immediate deaths. <span class='card-underline'>Contrast that </span>with a nuclear attack<span class='card-underline'> on a city</span> like Moscow, even one using a device of 6 kilotons, much smaller than the ones the United States used against Japanese targets in World War II. <span class='card-underline'>The immediate result: there would be 40,000 deaths, according to the online nuclear simulation tool NukeMap.

By the Defense Department’s reasoning, that might draw a nuclear response. But that’s a specific attack that could portend a nuclear first strike. As the U.S. adds more satellites, sensors, ground stations and other pieces of technology to its early warning network, the chances of a mishap rise — a troubling prospect that we’ve covered. But it’s a separate issue. But isn’t the potential for a cyber-physical attack becoming greater? Asked about it on Thursday, Greg Weaver, the Joint Staff deputy director of strategic capabilities, said, “Not sure I agree with that.” He added, “There’s no intent to expand the range of circumstances.” Said Soofer, the deputy assistant defense secretary: “We maintain in this document, as in other documents, that we retain some level of ambiguity that we would use nuclear weapons. And so when you talk about using nuclear weapons to deter non nuclear attacks, it’s all going to be situationally dependent. It’s all contextual. If an attack that doesn’t cause a lot of casualties …and the President has a lot of tools with which to respond. … conventional tools, nuclear tools, cyber tools. He or she will make that decision based on the circumstances.” On Friday, John Rood, defense undersecretary for policy, was asked whether a service disruption would prompt a nuclear retaliation.

But he did say that<span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the threshold for launching a nuclear strike is going up,</span></span><span class='card-underline'> not down.

Just a few years ago, researchers were making headlines with rudimentary machines that housed less than a dozen qubits -- the quantum version of a classical computer's binary bit. At IBM's inaugural Index Developer Conference held in San Francisco this week, <span class='card-underline'>the company showed off its latest prototype: a quantum computing rig housing 50 qubits, one of the most advanced machines currently in existence. </span>Quantum computing -- with its ability to calculate and solve algorithms in parallel, at speeds far faster than conventional computers -- promises to revolutionize fields from chemistry and logistics to finance and physics. The thing is, while quantum computing is a technology for the world of tomorrow, <span class='card-underline'>it </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>hasn't yet advanced far enough for anyone to know what that world will actually look like</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> "<span class='card-underline'>People aren't going to just wake up in three or four years, and say, 'Oh okay, now I'm ready to use quantum, what do I have to learn</span>,'" Bob Sutor, VP of IBM Q Strategy and Ecosystem at IBM Research, told Engadget. <span class='card-underline'>These systems rely on the "spooky" properties of quantum physics</span>, as Einstein put it, <span class='card-underline'>and their </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>operation is radically different from how today's computers work</span></span>. "What you're basically doing is you're replacing the notion of bits with something called qubits," Sutor said. "Ultimately when you measure a qubit it's zero or one, but before that there's a realm of freedom of what that can actually be. It's not zero and one at the same time or anything like this, it just takes on values from a much, much larger mathematical space. "The basic logic gates [AND, OR, NOT, NOR, etc], those gates are different for quantum," he continued. "The way the different qubits work together to get to a solution is completely different from the way the bits within your general memory works." Rather than tackling problems in sequence, as classical computers do, quantum rigs attempt to solve them in parallel. This enables quantum computers to solve certain equations, such as modeling complex molecules, far more efficiently. This efficiency, however, is tempered by the system's frailty. Currently, a qubit's coherence time tops out at 90 microseconds before decaying. <span class='card-underline'>That is, if a qubit is designated as a 1, it'll only remain a 1 for 0.0009 seconds. "After that all bets are off. You've got a certain amount of time in which to actually use this thing reliably,"</span> Sutor said. "Any computations you're going to do with a qubit have to come within that period." <span class='card-underline'>As such </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>quantum computers are highly sensitive to interference from temperature, microwaves, photons, even the electricity running the machine itself.</span></span><span class='card-underline'> Sutor said, "With heat you've got lots of electrons moving around, bumping into each other," which can lead to the qubit's decoherence. That's why these rigs have to be cooled to near absolute zero on order to operate. </span>"Outer space in the shade is between two and three degree Kelvin," Sutor explained. "<span class='card-underline'>Outer space is much too warm to do these types of calculations</span>." Instead, <span class='card-underline'>the lowest levels of a quantum computer rig, where the calculations themselves take place</span>, exist at a frosty 10 millikelvin <span class='card-underline'>-- a hundreth of a degree above absolute zero</span>. So no, Sutor assured Engadget, we probably shouldn't expect desktop quantum computers running at room temperature to exist within the next few decades -- perhaps even within our lifetimes. Surprisingly, these systems are fairly energy efficient. Aside from the energy needed to sufficiently cool the system for operation (a process that takes around 36 hours) IBM's 50-qubit rig only draws 10 to 15 kilowatts of power -- roughly equivalent to 10 standard microwave ovens. So now that IBM has developed a number of quantum computer systems ranging from 5 to 50 qubits, the next challenge is figuring out what to do with them. And that's where the company's Q network comes in. Last December, IBM announced that it's partnering with a number of Fortune 500 companies and research institutes -- including JPMorgan Chase, Samsung, Honda, Japan's Keio University, Oak Ridge National Lab and Oxford University -- to suss out potential practical applications for the technology. Learning centers like Keio University also act as localized hubs. "We in IBM research, while we have a large team on this, we can't work with everybody in the world who wants to work on quantum computing," Sutor explained. These hubs, however, "can work with local companies, local colleges, whomever to do whatever. They would get their quantum computer power from us, but they would be at the front lines." The same is true for Oakridge National Lab, Oxford University and the University of Melbourne. What's more, the company has also launched the IBM Q experience which allows anyone -- businesses, universities, even private citizens -- to write and submit their own quantum application or experiment to be run on the company's publicly available quantum computing rig. It's essentially a cloud service for quantum computations. So far more than 75,000 people have taken advantage of the service, running more than 2.5 million calculations which have resulted in more than two dozen published research papers on subjects ranging from quantum phase space measurement to homomorphic encryption. But while the public's interest in this technology is piqued, there is a significant knowledge gap that must be overcome before we start to see quantum applications proliferate the way classical programs did in the 1970s and '80s. "Let's say in the future you're running investment house types of calculations [similar to the financial risk applications that JP Morgan is currently developing]," Sutor points out, "there are big questions as to what those would be, and what the algorithms would be. We're way too early to have anything determined like that, even to the extent of knowing how well [quantum computing] will be applicable in some of these other areas." The entry point for writing programs is a challenge too. For classical computers, it's as simple as running a compiler. But there's not yet such a function for quantum computers. "What does it mean to optimize a quantum program knowing that this completely different from the model that's in your phone?" he queried. <span class='card-underline'>Another challenge that must be overcome is how to scale these machines. As Sutor points out, it's a simple enough task to add qubits to silicon chips, but every component added, increases the amount of heat generated and the amount of energy needed to keep the system within its operational temperature boundaries. So rather than simply packing in more and more qubits and setting off a quantum version of Moore's Law, Sutor believes that the next major step forward for this technology is quality over quantity.</span> "Having 50 great qubits is much more powerful than having 2,000 lousy ones," he quipped. "You don't want something very noisy that you're going to have to fix," but instead research should focus on improving the system's fidelity over increasing the qubit count. But even as quantum technologies continue to improve, there will still be a place in the world of tomorrow for classical computers. "Don't think of quantum as a wholesale replacement for anything you do," Sutor warned. "The theory says that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>you could run any classical algorithm on a quantum rig but it would be so glacially slow because it's not designed to run those types of products</span></span><span class='card-underline'>." </span>Instead, Sutor prefers to think of the current crop of quantum technologies as an accelerator. "It does certain things very quickly, it does some things we don't know how to do well classically... and so it'll work hand in hand that way." And if you're waiting for today's quantum computers to be able to compete with modern supercomputers anytime soon, you shouldn't hold your breath. <span class='card-underline'>"We need to get several orders of magnitude better than we are now to probably move into that period where we're solving the really super hard problems," he</span> said.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Advanced quantum computing is far away- prefer quantum physicists or sensationalist media</div><div class='cite'>Michael Biercuk 17 {Prof. Michael J.

Because quantum computers can also take different forms (general purpose versus tailored to one application), we can't even reach agreement on which system currently has the greatest set of capabilities. Similarly, <span class='card-underline'>there's now seemingly endless competition over simplified metrics such as the number of qubits. </span>Five<span class='card-underline'>, 16, </span>soon 49<span class='card-underline'>!</span> The question of whether a quantum computer is useful is defined by much more than this. Where to from here? <span class='card-underline'>There's been a media focus lately on achieving "</span>quantum supremacy<span class='card-underline'>".

Some quantum computer researchers are </span>seeking to devise<span class='card-underline'> slightly arcane problems that might allow quantum supremacy to be reached with, say, 50-100 qubits</span> – numbers reachable within the next several years. Achieving<span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>quantum supremacy does not mean either that those machines will be useful,</span></span> or that the path to large-scale machines will become clear. Moreover, we still need to figure out how to deal with errors. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Classical computers rarely suffer hardware faults</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span>– the "blue screen of death" generally comes from software bugs, rather than hardware failures. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The likelihood of hardware failure is</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>usually less than something like <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>one in a </span></span><span class='card-highlight'>billion-quadrillion</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>,</span></span> or 10-24 in scientific notation. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The best quantum computer hardware</span></span>, on the other hand, typically achieves only about <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>one in </span></span><span class='card-highlight'>10,000</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>,</span></span><span class='card-underline'> or 10-4.

But we still face many fundamental questions about how to build, operate or even validate the performance of the large-scale systems we sometimes hear are just around the corner. As an example<span class='card-underline'>, if we built a fully "</span>error-corrected<span class='card-underline'>" quantum computer at the scale of the millions of qubits required for useful factoring</span>, as far as we can tell, it would represent a totally new state of matter.

The authors report that generating a terabyte-size RSA key and carrying out the encryption-decryption process takes about five days. “The encryption and decryption cost is terrible for most applications,” said Scott Aaronson, the director of the Quantum Information Center at the University of Texas, Austin. What’s more, the security we gain from using enormous RSA keys is “extremely precarious, vulnerable to even a modest improvement in algorithms or hardware, or a determined and well-funded-enough adversary.” “Scott is thinking in a theoretical sense,” said Heninger, who maintains that the gap is enough “<span class='card-underline'>from a concrete security point of view</span>.” “More importantly,” the paper states, “<span class='card-underline'>it is interesting to see that the conventional wisdom is wrong.”</span></p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Status quo solves- decoding the human immune system is both necessary and will be accomplished within a decade</div><div class='cite'>Wayne Koff et al. 18 {Wayne C.

They were quite successful at killing people: The 6th century’s Plague of Justinian knocked out an estimated 17 percent of the world’s population; the 14th century Black Death decimated a third of Europe; the 1918 influenza pandemic killed 5 percent of the world; malaria is estimated to have killed half of all humans who have ever lived. Any yet, of course, humanity continued to flourish. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Our species’ recent explosion in lifespan is almost exclusively the result of the control of infectious diseases through sanitation, vaccination, and antimicrobial therapies</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>.</span> Only in the modern era, in which many infectious diseases have been tamed in the industrial world, do people have the luxury of death from cancer, heart disease, or stroke in the 8th decade of life. Childhoods are free from watching siblings and friends die from outbreaks of typhoid, scarlet fever, smallpox, measles, and the like. So what would it take for a disease to wipe out humanity now? In Michael Crichton’s The Andromeda Strain, the canonical book in the disease-outbreak genre, an alien microbe threatens the human race with extinction, and humanity’s best minds are marshaled to combat the enemy organism. Fortunately, outside of fiction, there’s no reason to expect alien pathogens to wage war on the human race any time soon, and my analysis suggests that any real-life domestic microbe reaching an extinction level of threat probably is just as unlikely. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Any apocalyptic pathogen would need to possess a very special combination of two attributes. First, it would have to be so unfamiliar that no existing therapy or vaccine could be applied to it. Second, it would need to have a high and surreptitious transmissibility before symptoms occur</span></span>. The first is essential because <span class='card-underline'>any microbe from a known class of pathogens would, by definition, have family members that could serve as models for containment and countermeasures</span>. The second would allow the hypothetical disease to spread without being detected by even the most astute clinicians. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The three infectious diseases most likely to be considered extinction-level threats in the world today—influenza, HIV, and Ebola—don’t meet these two</span></span> requirements. <span class='card-underline'>Influenza</span>, for instance, <span class='card-underline'>despite its well-established ability to kill on a large scale, its contagiousness, and its unrivaled ability to shift and drift away from our vaccines, is still what I would call a “known unknown.” </span>While there are many mysteries about how new flu strains emerge, from at least the time of Hippocrates, humans have been attuned to its risk. And in the modern era, <span class='card-underline'>a full-fledged industry of influenza preparedness exists, with effective vaccine strategies and antiviral therapies. </span>HIV, which has killed 39 million people over several decades, is similarly limited due to several factors. Most importantly, <span class='card-underline'>HIV’s dependency on blood</span> and body fluid for transmission (similar to Ebola) requires intimate human-to-human contact, which <span class='card-underline'>limits contagion</span>. Highly potent antiviral therapy allows most people to live normally with the disease, and a substantial group of the population has genetic mutations that render them impervious to infection in the first place. Lastly, simple prevention strategies such as needle exchange for injection drug users and barrier contraceptives—when available—can curtail transmission risk. <span class='card-underline'>Ebola</span>, for many of the same reasons as HIV as well as several others, also falls short of the mark. This is especially due to the fact that it <span class='card-underline'>spreads almost exclusively through people with easily recognizable symptoms, plus the taming of its once unfathomable 90 percent mortality rate by simple supportive care. Beyond those three,</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> every other known disease falls short of what seems required to wipe out humans</span></span><span class='card-underline'>—which is, of course, why we’re still here</span>. And it’s not that diseases are ineffective. On the contrary, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>diseases’ failure to knock us out is a testament to just how resilient humans are</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>. P</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>art of our evolutionary heritage is our immune system, one of the most complex on the planet, even without the benefit of vaccines or the helping hand of antimicrobial drugs.</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>This system, when viewed at a species level, can adapt to almost any enemy imaginable. Coupled to genetic variations amongst humans—which open up the possibility for a range of advantages, from imperviousness to infection to a tendency for mild symptoms—<span class='card-underline'>this</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> adaptability ensures that almost any infectious disease onslaught will leave a large proportion of the population alive to rebuild</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>,</span> in contrast to the fictional Hollywood versions. While the immune system’s role can never be understated, an even more powerful protector is the faculty of consciousness. Humans are not the most prolific, quickly evolving, or strongest organisms on the planet, but as Aristotle identified, humans are the rational animals—and it is this fundamental distinguishing characteristic that allows humans to form abstractions, think in principles, and plan long-range. These capacities, in turn, allow humans to modify, alter, and improve themselves and their environments. Consciousness equips us, at an individual and a species level, to make nature safe for the species through such technological marvels as antibiotics, antivirals, vaccines, and sanitation. When humans began to focus their minds on the problems posed by infectious disease, human life ceased being nasty, brutish, and short. In many ways, human consciousness became infectious diseases’ worthiest adversary. None of this is meant to allay all fears of infectious diseases. To totally adopt a Panglossian viewpoint would be foolish—and dangerous. Humans do face countless threats from infectious diseases: witness Zika. And if not handled appropriately, severe calamity could, and will, ensue. The West African Ebola outbreak, for instance, festered for months before major efforts to bring it under control were initiated. When it comes to infectious diseases, I’m worried about the failure of institutions to understand the full impact of outbreaks. I’m worried about countries that don’t have the infrastructure or resources to combat these outbreaks when they come.

This summer brought some of the biggest, most destructive storms in recorded history: Harvey laid waste to huge swathes of Texas; Irma left Barbuda virtually uninhabitable; Maria ravaged Dominica and plunged Puerto Rico into darkness. The images we see in the media are almost too violent to comprehend. And these are the storms that made the news; many others did not. Monsoon flooding in India, Bangladesh and Nepal killed 1,200 people and left millions homeless, but Western media paid little attention: it’s too much suffering to take in at once. What’s most disturbing about this litany of pain is that <span class='card-underline'>it’s only going to get worse.</span> A recent paper in the journal Nature estimates that <span class='card-underline'>o</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>ur chances of keeping global warming below the danger threshold of 2 degrees is now vanishingly small: only about 5 per cent.</span></span><span class='card-underline'> It’s more likely that we’re headed for around 3.2 degrees of warming, and possibly as much as 4.9 degrees. </span>If <span class='card-underline'>scientists are clear</span> about anything, it’s <span class='card-underline'>that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>this level of climate change will be nothing short of catastrophic</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. Indeed, there’s a good chance that it would render large-scale civilization impossible. </span>Why are our prospects so bleak? According to the paper’s authors, it’s because <span class='card-underline'>the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>cuts we’re making to greenhouse gas emissions are being more than cancelled out by economic growth.</span></span><span class='card-underline'> In the coming decades, we’ll be able to reduce the carbon intensity (CO2 per unit of GDP) of the global economy by about 1.9 per cent per year, </span>they say, if we make heavy investments in clean energy and efficient technology. That’s a lot. But <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>as long as the economy keeps growing</span></span><span class='card-underline'> by more than that,</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> total emissions are still going to rise</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. Right now we’re ratcheting up global GDP by 3 per cent per year. A</span>t that rate, <span class='card-underline'>the maths is not in our favour</span>; on the contrary, it’s slapping us in the face. In fact, <span class='card-underline'>according to new models published last year, with a background rate of 3 per cent GDP growth it’s not possible to achieve any level of emissions reductions at all, even under best-case-scenario conditions</span>. Study after study shows the same thing: <span class='card-underline'>keeping global warming below 2 degrees is simply not compatible with continued economic growth. </span>This is a tough pill to swallow. After all, right now GDP growth is the primary policy objective of virtually every government on Earth. Over <span class='card-underline'>in Silicon Valley, tech-optimists are hoping that a miracle of artificial intelligence might allow us to decarbonise the economy by 3 per cent or more per year</span>, so we can continue growing the GDP while reducing emissions. It sounds wonderful. But <span class='card-underline'>remember, t</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>he goal is not just to reduce carbon emissions – the goal is to reduce them dramatically</span></span>, and fast. How fast, exactly? Climate scientists Kevin Anderson and Alice Bows say that if we want <span class='card-underline'>t</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>o have even a mere 50 per cent chance of staying under 2 degrees, rich nations are going to have to cut emissions by 8-10 per cent per year</span></span>, beginning in 2015. Keep in mind we’re already two years in, and so far our emissions reductions have been zero. Here’s the hard bit. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>It’s just not possible to achieve emissions reductions of 8-10 per cent per year by decarbonising the econom</span></span><span class='card-underline'>y. In fact, there is a strong scientific consensus that</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> emissions reductions of this rate are only feasible if we</span></span><span class='card-underline'> stop our mad pursuit of economic growth and do something totally unprecedented: </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>begin to scale down our annual production and consumption</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. </span>This is what ecologists call ‘planned de-growth’. It sounds horrible, at first glance. It sounds like austerity, or voluntary poverty. After all, for decades we’ve been told that GDP growth is good, that it’s essential to progress, and that if we want to eradicate poverty around the world, we need more of it. The only reason we’re all chasing GDP growth is because we’ve been made to believe that it’s the only way to improve the incomes and lives of ordinary people. But it’s not. Politicians and economists rally around GDP growth because they see it as preferable to redistribution. They would rather grow the pie than go about the messy business of sharing what we already have more equally, since the latter tends to upset rich people. Henry Wallich, a former member of the US Federal Reserve Board, made this clear when he pointed out that ‘Growth is a substitute for equality’. But we can flip Wallich’s greedy little quip on its head: if growth is a substitute for equality, then equality can be a substitute for growth. By sharing what we already have more fairly, we can render additional economic growth unnecessary. In this sense, de-growth is nothing at all like austerity. In fact, it’s exactly the opposite. Austerity means cutting social spending and slashing taxes on the rich in order to – supposedly – keep the economy growing. This has crushing consequences for ordinary people’s lives. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>De-growth</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>,</span> by contrast, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>calls for cutting the excesses of the richest while redistributing existing resources and investing in social goods – universal healthcare, education, affordable housing etc</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>. </span>The whole point is to sustain and even improve human wellbeing without the need for endless economic expansion<span class='card-underline'>. De-growth is a philosophy that insists that our economy is already more than abundant enough for all of us – if only we learn how to share it. One easy way to do this would be to roll out a universal basic income and fund it through new progressive taxes</span> – taxes on carbon, on land, on resource use, on financial transactions, and so on. This is the most sensible and elegant way to share our abundance, and it comes with an added benefit: if the basic income is high enough, it will free people to walk away from unnecessary jobs that produce unnecessary stuff, releasing some of the pressure on our planet. Crucially<span class='card-underline'>, de-growth does not mean we have to get rid of the stock of stuff that we already have</span>, as a nation: houses, furniture, shoes, museums, railways, whatever. In fact, <span class='card-underline'>it doesn’t even mean that we have to stop producing and consuming new stuff. It just means we have to reduce the amount of new stuff that we produce and consume each year.</span> When you see it this way, it’s really not so threatening. <span class='card-underline'>If we degrow by 5 per cent per year (which is what scientists say is necessary), that means we have to cut our consumption of new stuff by 5 per cent.</span> It’s easy to make up for that by just repairing and reusing stuff we already have. And we can encourage this more creative approach to stuff by curbing advertising, like Sao Paulo, Chennai and other cities have done. Of course, there are deeper, more structural dimensions of our economy that we will have to change. <span class='card-underline'>One of the reasons we need growth is to pay off all the debt that’s sloshing around in our economy</span>. In fact, our entire money system is based on debt: more than 90 per cent of the currency circulating in our economy is loans created out of thin air by commercial banks. <span class='card-underline'>The problem with debt is that it comes with interest, and to pay off interest at a compound rate we have to work, earn, and sell more and more each year. In this sense, every dollar of new money we create heats up the planet. But cancel the debt and shift to a debt-free currency, and suddenly we don’t have to labour under this relentless pressure</span>. There are already plenty of ideas out there for how to do this. Still, we have to be honest with ourselves: : the Stern Review projects that <span class='card-underline'>c</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>limate change is set to cost us 5-20 per cent of global GDP per year, which is going to violently change our economy</span></span><span class='card-underline'> beyond all recognition, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>and cause enormous human suffering in the process</span></span>. The storms that churned across the Atlantic this summer are only a small taste of what is to come. The choice is clear: either we evolve into a future beyond capitalism, or we won’t have a future at all.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>We passed the tipping point- 400 ppm.</div><div class='cite'>Aaron Ellison 17 {Aaron M.

Perhaps there’s still time to take the concrete, immediate actions experts suggest — along the minimum efforts laid out in the 2015 Paris accord that amplified suggestions made by President Barack Obama in his June 25, 2013 speech at Georgetown University — that would ensure a sustainable, high-quality future. Tipping points are the cusp between one set of conditions and another; <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>when a tipping point is passed, change is rapid, uncontrolled and often irreversible</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. Passing a tipping point is like crossing a threshold from one room to another and having the door triple-locked behind you; </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the state of the world after the tipping point is very different from the state of the world before the tipping point, and it is very difficult to go back.</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>It’s important to make this distinction, because Malcolm Gladwell erroneously redefined tipping points more than a decade ago in his book, The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference. In doing so, he changed the way we think about rapidly emerging social phenomena, such as the Dutch tulip frenzy, the housing bubble, or the re-emergence of a market for Hush Puppies. Although many have argued that the publication of The Tipping Point itself was a tipping point in how we think and talk about tipping points, Gladwell weakly equated tipping points with viral epidemics. This misleading analogy obscured the true meaning of “tipping point,” leading to confusion in how we think about responding to rapid environmental change. Epidemics, you see, require an initial infection in a particular individual, a pool of nearby people susceptible to the same infection, and a way for the disease to be transmitted to the susceptible individuals. Gladwell similarly invoked mavens, connectors and salesmen who collect and transmit new ideas to the wider world to explain the rapid emergence of new social phenomena. But this analogy doesn’t necessarily work; resistance evolves to new diseases, epidemics peak and burn out, and most new social phenomena are simply fads. In fact all of the examples in The Tipping Point — the sudden emergence of fax machines and Airwalk sneakers, the resurgence of sales of Hush Puppies suede shoes, the rise and fall of crime rate in many cities (that is rising once again in some), and sudden epidemics of suicides — are of explosions of interest in new phenomena followed by a return to the status quo ante and a search for the next new fad. But they are not tipping points. In contrast, economists, sociologists, historians, ecologists, climatologists, oceanographers and most others who for decades have given serious study to tipping points focus on rapid, seemingly permanent changes. In modern parlance, a <span class='card-underline'>tipping point presages a change in regime. And</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> the prime example of a tipping point in the natural world is, many feel, climate change</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>.</span> Bill McKibben and the thousands of followers of 350.org working to solve the climate crisis assert that we passed a tipping point in the 1980s, when human industry caused the concentration of atmospheric CO2 to exceed 350 ppm: the so-called “safe” level of CO2 in the atmosphere. President Obama noted at Georgetown that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been measuring CO2 since the 1950s because of that agency’s even earlier concern that the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would disrupt the fragile balance of nature that makes our planet so hospitable to life and push us over the tipping point that leads to a planet beyond repair. So on 5/9 — when NOAA’s observatory atop Mauna Loa, Hawaii, recorded a concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that exceeded 400 parts per million (0.04 percent) for the first time in recorded history — a tipping point finally may have been passed. Although <span class='card-underline'>the deciduous forests of the northern hemisphere that provide New England with spectacular colors every fall will inhale some of that CO2 as they leaf out every spring, those great “lungs of the planet” cannot keep the CO2 in the atmosphere below 400 ppm.</span> And<span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>even if an all-powerful deity were to manage to convince us to stop burning of all fossil fuels today, the “inertia” in the climate system would ensure that the Earth’s temperature would keep increasing and sea levels would continue to rise </span></span>another meter or two over the next 2,000 years.<span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The inexorable warming of the planet caused by an ever-denser blanket of CO2 above us is not a fad </span></span>— on 5/9, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>we passed a tipping point and entered a new world.</span></span> This new reality is a consequence of our lifestyles intersecting with fundamental and unbreakable laws of physics. We simply need to own up to the fact that we are in a new climatic regime; global warming indeed is happening now.

The assault on honest debate More than an academic rejoinder, Hall et al.'s response gives the impression of a resolute protest petition (symbolically signed by 51 scholars) aimed at both Tourism Managementand the present dissenting authors for having the audacity to produce such a “deviant” paper, which sheds light on inconvenient (as far as the mainstream environmental movement goes) scientific evidence. The rhetoric style used by Hall el al. to undermine the arguments presented in our paper is well known to those who are familiar with the intense scientific debate on climate change. <span class='card-underline'>Climate change alarmists have never hesitated to ridicule and bully environmental skeptics, using ad hominem arguments, for example when labeling them as “deniers</span>” (a designation invoking “holocaust deniers”) <span class='card-underline'>or “right-wing extremists,” dealing with “voodoo science.” These styles and language are indicative of an academic witch-hunt, rather than factual and productive scientific discourse. </span>This disturbing approach has also been reflected in active attempts on behalf of powerful gatekeepers to censor and silence nonconforming voices. The email controversy at the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia (best known as “Climategate”) revealed in 2009, demonstrated what can be easily be termed as “climate McCarthyism.” This scandal exposed plots by leading and influential researchers to academically cast off dissenting climatologists, suppress the publication of articles that failed to fall in line with the narrative of man-made global warming, and even removing “uncooperative” journal editors from their positions. In light of this upsetting background, we feel a strong sense of appreciation for the editor and reviewers of Tourism Management for recognizing the value of open debate on the subject and allowing it to take place in this important outlet. 2. The “consensus” on anthropogenic climate change Hall et al. accuse us of “climate change denial and misrepresentation” in arguing that “climate change is a highly controversial scientific topic” and that “the theory of anthropogenic global warming (AGW)…is far from being conclusive” (Shani & Arad, 2014, p. 82). In their attempt to refute these claims, Hall et al. first extensively refer to the reports of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which decisively and consistently warn against dangerous and unprecedented man-made climate change. Yet, the reputation of the IPCC, “the Vatican of climate science,” has sustained serious harm in recent years due to accusations of tribalism, lack of scrutiny, and controversies such as Climagegate (the IPCC relied heavily on the scientific work of CRU) (Hulme & Ravetz, 2009). Climategate revealed the manipulation of scientific literature to be included in IPCC reports as well as intentional disregard of other peer-reviewed articles that were disagreeable with the IPCC's desired conclusions (Holliman, 2011, Ryghaug and Skjölsvold, 2010). Consequently, the InterAcademy Council (IAC), <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>a global network consisting of over 106 national science academies, issued a critique of the IPCC's procedures and processes, indicating critical deficiencies in its work and pointing to the need for fundamental transformations to restore the perceived impartiality of the IPCC and to prevent incidents of groupthink in the future</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span>(Shapiro et al., 2010). There is not enough time or space to cover all the inaccuracies, misinformation and factual errors detected in IPCC reports. However, these include the Himalayan glaciers fiasco (in which the IPCC's claim that the glaciers in the Himalayas would melt away by 2035 was based on a misprint – for 2350 – in a story that appeared in an environmental pressure group's report) (Cogley, Kargel, Kaser, & van der Veen, 2010), and the deliberate concealment of scientific data invalidating the “hockey stick” graph, which (falsely) presented the 1990s as the hottest decade in the millennium (Holland, 2007, McKitrick, 2005). Given IPCC's problematic record, it is simply irresponsible to take their reports unquestionably, as Hall et al. do. Interestingly, they heavily criticized us for (negligibly, we might add) referring to “non-peer-reviewed” materials, such as reports from conservative think tanks (by the way, Cato Institute is far from being “conservative”). Perhaps Hall et al. should more seriously consider the idiom “people who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.” Following the summary of the IPCC's main conclusions, Hall et al. moves to establish their claim on “<span class='card-underline'>scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change,” by detailing the resonant study of Cook et al. (2013).</span> According to this study's findings, about 97% of abstracts of scientific papers on climate issues from 1991 to 2011 support the alleged consensus on AGW. The 97% figure indeed sounds impressive and received much attention in the media and from politicians and policymakers (including US President Barak Obama). Yet unfortunately, <span class='card-underline'>a careful review of the study and its methodology reveals that very little can actually be concluded. The “consensus” referred to in Cook et al.'s study (2013) applies to trivial consensus according to which carbon dioxide (CO2) is a greenhouse gas and that humanity is capable of warming the planet, premises that are accepted even among most climate change skeptics.</span> Yet, issues such as the extent and rate of climate change, the extent of the human factor in causing climate change, the consequences of climate change, and the optimal strategies to respond to climate change are at the heart of the scientific debate. Cook et al.'s paper (2013), as well as other related studies such as Anderegg, Prall, Harold, and Schneider (2010), provide no valuable insights on the extent of agreement regarding AGW, but were nevertheless successfully utilized for public relations purposes. 3. Uncertainty in climate change assessments <span class='card-underline'>Hall et al. defend the I</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>PCC's climate models and attack our assertion that they have thus far failed to demonstrate a high level of accuracy, citing the IPCC's accounts themselves as evidence. </span></span><span class='card-underline'>I</span>n doing so, they largely ignore the clear evidence that since 1997<span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>there has been no discernible rise in aggregate global temperatures, despite continuing greenhouse gas emissions </span></span><span class='card-underline'>(Curry, 2014). </span>Furthermore, despite the “very high confidence” the IPCC attributes to its models in reproducing observed temperatures, consistent large disparities have been detected between observed and simulated global warming (Christy et al., 2010, Douglass and Christy, 2013). Several explanations have been suggested for the – unforeseen by climate models – warming hiatus and the overestimated rise in temperatures (e.g., Fyfe et al., 2013, Solomon et al., 2010), but this clearly raises serious questions as to the confidence policymakers should place in the IPCC's projections of climate change (Curry, 2011). Despite the claims made by the IPCC (and also mentioned by Hall et al.), their profound understanding of the climate change mechanism does not seem to improve over time. <span class='card-underline'>Consider the crucial issue of climate sensitivity, i.e. the amount of warming that doubling CO2 in the atmosphere would eventually produce. </span>According to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (2007), the equilibrium climate sensitivity is likely in the range 2 °C–4.5 °C, while according to its newer Fifth Assessment Report (2013) it is 1.5 °C–4.5 °C. In other words, <span class='card-underline'>the likely equilibrium sensitivity is now known less accurately.</span> Astrophysicist and climate researcher Nir Shaviv responded to this lack of improved understanding, “After perhaps billions of dollars invested in climate research over more than three decades, our ability to answer the most important question in climate has not improved a single bit!” (2013, para 6). Shaviv accused the IPCC of dogmatic science that prevents its members from recognizing the errors in the basic premises of AGW. Other studies reported that climate sensitivity could be significantly lower than is suggested by IPCC (Otto et al., 2013, Shaviv, 2005, Schlesinger et al., 2012). <span class='card-underline'>The i</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>mplications of lower climate sensitivity than the IPCC's estimations are that the future global warming will be slower, allowing humanity more time for gradual adaptation to climate changes.</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>The uncertainty that encompasses current climate change assessments is strengthened in light of the studies indicating that over earth's history there have been distinct warm periods with temperatures exceeding the current ones (Esper et al., 2012, McIntyre and McKittrick, 2003, Soon and Baliunas, 2003). Reviewing the relevant scientific literature, Khandekar, Murty, and Chittibabu (2005) concluded that “in the context of the earth's climate through the last 500 million years, the recent (1975–2000) increase in the earth's mean temperature does not appear to be unusual or unprecedented as claimed by IPCC and many supporters of the global warming hypothesis” (p. 1568). Other studies challenged the mainstream climate change narrative, according to which CO2 levels in the earth's atmosphere play a prominent role in rising temperatures. One notable example is the research by Shaviv and Veizer (2003), which demonstrates that the earth's temperature correlates well with variations in cosmic ray flux, rather than changes in atmospheric CO2. These findings and others stir contentious debates within the climate scientific community, but are nevertheless largely overlooked by the IPCC, which ignores alternative explanations for climate change. Regrettably, Hall et al. scornfully dismiss this evidence, presented in our research note, based on cherry-picking of a few “non-peer-reviewed” references that were cited, some vague claims about “misreading” and “selective citing,” as well as other semantic nitpicking. 4. Impacts of climate change The IPCC warns that climate change is likely to have severe consequences, particularly for poor countries, such as increased hunger, water shortages, vulnerability to extreme weather events and debilitating diseases. However, these estimations have been heavily criticized for failing to properly account for substantial improvements in adaptive capacity (i.e., the capability of coping with the impact of global warming) that are likely to occur due to advances in economic development, technological change and human capital over the next century (Goklany, 2007). <span class='card-underline'>Fostering economic growth and technological development, largely achievable through the use of fossil fuels, will strengthen both industrialized and developing countries' adaptive capacity to deal not just with possible future climate change consequences, but also with other environmental and public health problems</span>. Such policy will provide greater benefits at lower costs than drastic climate change mitigation efforts involving substantially cutting greenhouse gas emissions (Goklany, 2004, Goklany, 2012). Furthermore, the analyses of Galiana and Green (2009) exemplify that in the current state of energy technologies, the suggested plans for ambitious emission reductions will likely severely clobber the global economy, especially in view of present economic conditions. In order to stabilize atmospheric CO2 at accepted levels, there is a need for enormous advances in efficient energy technology, which is currently missing (Pielke, Wigley & Green, 2008). In any case, even if every industrialized nation meets the most ambitious emissions targets set by the Kyoto Protocol, such efforts are likely to have little effect, particularly in the light of the considerable increases in greenhouse gas emissions by rising economic superpowers as China and India, as well as the remaining developing world (Wigley, 1998). Hall et al. criticized us for choosing “selective citations…that discuss natural processes potentially affect climate in specific locations and times.” Yet <span class='card-underline'>the purpose of referring to such studies was to refute the claims made by the IPCC and other climate change alarmists to the effect that recent extreme weather events </span>(e.g., floods, droughts and storms) <span class='card-underline'>are</span> <span class='card-underline'>the consequences of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases</span>. Moreover, <span class='card-underline'>data shows that </span>despite claims that the number and intensity of extreme weather has increased, between 1900 and 2010 <span class='card-underline'>the average annual death and death rates from</span> <span class='card-underline'>extreme weather events has declined by 93% and 98%, respectively</span> (Goklany, 2009). This is mostly due to economic and technological factors, such as improved global food production, increase globalized food trade and better disaster preparedness. IPCC's exaggerated estimations of climate change impacts were also noted in an op-ed in Financial Times written by climate economist Richard Tol (2014), a week following his demand that his name as one of the leading authors be removed from the IPCC's AR5 due to its over alarmist assessments of the impacts of AGW and underestimation of humanity's adaptive capacity. As concluded by Tol, “<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Humans are a tough and adaptable species.</span></span><span class='card-underline'> People live on the equator and in the Arctic, in the desert and in the rainforest. We survived ice ages with primitive technologies. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The idea that climate change poses an existential threat to humankind is laughable</span></span><span class='card-underline'>”</span> (2014, para 1).</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Alt Causes- censorship, torturing, restriction of freedoms, opacity.</div><div class='cite'>Kenneth Roth 18 {Kenneth Roth is the executive director of Human Rights Watch, one of the world's leading international human rights organizations, which operates in more than 90 countries. 2018. “World Report 2018” https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2018/country-chapters/china-and-tibet}//JM</div><div class='card-body'><p>The broad and sustained offensive on human rights that started after President Xi Jinping took power five years ago showed no sign of abating in 2017. The death of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo in a hospital under heavy guard in July highlighted the Chinese government’s deepening contempt for rights. The near future for human rights appears grim, especially as Xi is expected to remain in power at least until 2022. Foreign governments did little in 2017 to push back against China’s worsening rights record at home and abroad. <span class='card-underline'>The </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Chinese government, which already oversees one of the strictest online censorship regimes in the world, limited the provision of censorship circumvention tools and strengthened ideological control over education and mass media in 2017</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> Schools and state media incessantly tout the supremacy of the Chinese Communist Party, and, increasingly, of President Xi Jinping as “core” leader. Authorities subjected more human rights defenders—including foreigners—to show trials in 2017, airing excerpted forced confessions and court trials on state television and social media. Police ensured the detainees’ compliance by torturing some of them, denying them access to lawyers of their choice, and holding them incommunicado for months. In Xinjiang, a nominally autonomous region with 11 million Turkic Muslim Uyghurs, authorities stepped up mass surveillance and the security presence despite the lack of evidence demonstrating an organized threat. They also adopted new policies denying Uyghurs cultural and religious rights. Hong Kong’s human rights record took a dark turn. <span class='card-underline'>Hong Kong courts disqualified four pro-democracy lawmakers in July and jailed three prominent pro-democracy student leaders in August. China’s growing global influence means many of its rights violations now have international implications</span>. In April, security officials at the United Nations headquarters in New York City ejected from the premises Dolkun Isa, an ethnic Uyghur rights activist, who was accredited as a nongovernmental organization (NGO) participant to a forum there; no explanation was provided. In June, the European Union failed for the first time ever to deliver a statement under a standing agenda item at the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) regarding country situations requiring the council’s attention. This stemmed from Greece blocking the necessary EU consensus for such an intervention due to its unwillingness to criticize human rights violations in China, with which it has substantial trade ties. Chinese officials continued throughout the year to pressure governments around the world to forcibly return allegedly corrupt mainland officials despite a lack of legal protections in China or refugee status determination procedures outside China. Despite the high costs, many in China continued to fight for rights and justice in 2017. Activists, including those working on women’s, disability, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights, continued to take cases to court to seek limited redress and raise awareness. In a small but significant step, in July a court in Henan province ruled against a public hospital for forcing a gay man to undergo discriminatory “conversion therapy.” In its narrow ruling, the court found that admitting the plaintiff to the hospital against his will violated his rights. Human Rights Defenders The death of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo in 2017 laid bare authorities’ ruthlessness towards peaceful proponents of human rights and democracy. In July, after serving nearly nine years of his 11-year prison sentence for “inciting subversion,” Liu Xiaobo died from cancer in a Shenyang hospital, heavily guarded by state security. During his hospitalization, authorities isolated Liu and his wife, Liu Xia, from family and supporters, and denied Liu’s request to seek treatment outside the country. Since Liu’s death, authorities have forcibly disappeared Liu Xia. The government also harassed and detained a group of Liu’s supporters for commemorating his death. In 2017, authorities continued politically motivated prosecutions of human rights activists and lawyers who were rounded up in a nationwide crackdown that began in July 2015. Lawyer Wang Quanzhang and activist Wu Gan remained in police custody, awaiting trial or verdict on baseless charges. In November, lawyer Jiang Tianyong was sentenced to two years in prison on charges of “inciting subversion of state power.” <span class='card-underline'>A number of those caught in the “709 crackdown” were freed, but they continue to be closely monitored and isolated from friends and colleagues; some revealed that they were tortured and forced to confess while in detention. Authorities also continued to harass and intimidate the lawyers who represent the detainees</span>, ordering them not to speak to media and disbarring several after giving them failing marks in China’s annual lawyers’ evaluation. In March, a court in Guangdong province, in separate trials, convicted women’s rights activist Su Changlan and online political commentator Chen Qitang on baseless charges of “inciting subversion” and sentenced them to prison terms of three years and four-and-a-half years, respectively. Su was released in October after serving her sentence. Her health deteriorated sharply while in detention due to inadequate medical care and poor conditions in detention. In March, a Sichuan court sentenced artist Chen Yunfei to four years in prison on charges of “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” in connection with his activities commemorating the 1989 Tiananmen Massacre. <span class='card-underline'>The government also tried to eliminate the country’s few independent human rights news websites by jailing their founders.</span> In August, a Yunnan court sentenced citizen journalist and protest chronicler Lu Yuyu to four years in prison on charges of “picking quarrels and provoking trouble.” Also in August, authorities charged Liu Feiyue, founder of the website Civil Rights and Livelihood Watch (民生观察) with “leaking state secrets” and “inciting subversion of state power.” Liu could face life imprisonment if convicted. Veteran activist and founder of the human rights website 64 Tianwang, Huang Qi, suffers from kidney disease and has been denied adequate medical care since his detention in November 2016. In August, prominent rights lawyer and activist Gao Zhisheng disappeared from his home in Shaanxi province. Authorities subsequently informed Gao’s family that he had been taken into police custody. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>China continues to detain non-citizens for promoting human rights in China.</span></span><span class='card-underline'> In March, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Guangdong authorities arbitrarily detained Taiwan democracy activist Lee Ming-che.

In March, Chongqing authorities made public a regulation that bans unauthorized use of internet circumvention tools in the city. Anyone—from individuals to companies—who does so would be ordered to disconnect and receive a warning. The regulation was unprecedented in banning all use of these tools. The same month a Guangdong court sentenced Deng Jiewei to nine months in jail for illegally selling virtual private networks, or VPNs, which protect user privacy by shielding browsing activities from service providers or state surveillance. In July, Apple removed dozens of VPNs from its App store in China, citing compliance with government regulations. In August, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) ordered five websites, including shopping giant Alibaba, to remove vendors that offered access to VPNs. In September, police detained Zhen Jianghua, activist and founder of a website that teaches people how to circumvent internet censorship, on suspicion of “inciting subversion.” In November, in a letter to two US senators, Apple confirmed that it had removed 674 VPNs from its App store in China this year, citing compliance with government regulations. Authorities further tightened screws on social media. In June, they shut down dozens of entertainment news and celebrity gossip social media accounts after calling on internet companies to “actively promote socialist core values” and stop the spread of “vulgar … sentiments.” In August, the CAC announced additional new regulations on the requirement of real-name registration. In September Weibo barred users who had not registered with their real names from posting messages on their own microblogs or comment on others. In September, the CAC promulgated measures to make creators of online chat groups such as those on QQ and Wechat liable for information other users shared in the groups. The rules also require the service providers to establish credit rating systems for chat group users. Those who violate Chinese laws and regulations will have their credit scores lowered. In September, Beijing police arrested Liu Pengfei, the creator of a WeChat group that had discussed political and social issues. Authorities continued their assault on academic freedom. In January, Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou banned staff from criticizing the Communist Party. In June, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the party’s disciplinary body, issued a report accusing 14 top universities of ideological infractions after a months-long investigation. Several professors were fired for speaking critically of the Chinese government on social media. In August, Shi Jiepeng, a professor of classical Chinese at Beijing Normal University, was sacked for “improper comments”; Shi had called Mao Zedong a “devil.” <span class='card-underline'>In August, Cambridge University Press admitted it had </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>blocked access in China to more than 300 articles published in its journal China Quarterly</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, following orders from the Chinese government. </span>The international backlash against the decision compelled the publishing house to restore the articles. In November, Springer Nature pulled access to over 1,000 articles in China. The publisher said the decision was to comply with Chinese regulations. In March, authorities issued new measures to reduce the number of foreign children’s titles published in Chinese. In August, the Ministry of Education issued new national editions of primary and middle school liberal arts textbooks, with added emphasis on traditional culture and “core socialist values.” Gui Minhai, a Swedish national and publisher of books critical of the Chinese leadership, was abducted in Thailand in October 2015. After holding Gui for two years in secret detention in China, the Chinese government in October told Swedish diplomats that Gui had been “released.” Hong Kong <span class='card-underline'>Civil liberties in Hong Kong are increasingly being undermined by the growing interference of the central government</span>, 20 years after the city returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. <span class='card-underline'>Opposition political parties and their supporters faced greater harassment from authorities.</span> In April, the Companies Registry rejected the application of the Hong Kong National Party on grounds that the promotion of “Hong Kong independence is against the Basic Law.” During President Xi’s visit to Hong Kong, local and mainland police followed, harassed, and arrested some peaceful pro-democracy protesters. <span class='card-underline'>In April, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Hong Kong police arrested 11 pro-democracy advocate</span></span><span class='card-underline'>s on charges including “unlawful assembly” and “obstructing police</span>.” The charges stem from the advocates’ protest against a decision by China’s top legislative body forcing Hong Kong courts to disqualify two pro-independence legislators. In July, a Hong Kong court disqualified four more pro-democracy lawmakers for modifying their oaths swearing allegiance to China in a 2016 ceremony. In <span class='card-underline'>March, two mainland government advisers said the central government will rely more on “legal means”—suggesting manipulation of the territory’s legal system—to strengthen central control. </span>In April, the chief of legal affairs at the China Liaison Office in Hong Kong said the “one country, two systems” principle could be abolished altogether if the city “fails to actively defend the sovereignty” of China. In June mainland officials declared that the Sino-British Joint Declaration, which states that Hong Kong enjoys “a high degree of autonomy” except in foreign affairs and defense, “no longer has any realistic meaning.” In August, a Hong Kong appeals court sentenced pro-democracy student leaders Alex Chow, Nathan Law, and Joshua Wong to six to eight months in prison. The three had earlier been convicted of crimes related to “unlawful assembly” for peaceful protests at the time of the 2014 Umbrella Movement, and were given community sentences by a lower court. In a politically motivated move, the secretary of justice, a political appointee, sought a harsher prison sentence for the trio. Also in August, the same court convicted 13 defendants of unlawful assembly for another anti-government protest in 2014. The 13, who had previously been sentenced to community service, were given prison terms of between 8 and 13 months after the Justice Department sought a review of their sentences. In October, the Court of Final Appeal released Chow, Law, and Wong on bail, pending appeal. Xinjiang <span class='card-underline'>The Chinese government has long conflated peaceful activism with violence in Xinjiang, and has treated many expressions of Uyghur identity, including language and religion, as threatening. </span>Uyghur opposition to government policies has been expressed in peaceful protests but also through violent attacks. However, details about protests and violence are scant, as authorities severely curtail independent reporting in the region. In 2017, the Chinese government continued its 2014 “strike-hard” campaign in Xinjiang, which vowed to adopt “unconventional tactics” in countering terrorism. After Party Secretary Chen Quanguo was transferred from Tibet to Xinjiang in August 2016<span class='card-underline'>, the Xinjiang regional government expanded its already pervasive security measures by hiring thousands more security personnel.</span> In July, authorities forced residents in a district of Urumqi, the capital city of Xinjiang, to install surveillance apps on their mobile phones. In 2017, the Xinjiang government also waged a campaign against “two faced” Uyghur cadres thought to oppose the party’s stance on Uyghurs. In April, 97 officials in Hotan prefecture were reprimanded. Authorities increasingly restricted and punished Uyghurs’ foreign ties. Since October 2016, authorities have arbitrarily recalled passports from residents of Xinjiang. Since about April, 2017 authorities have arbitrarily detained thousands of Uyghurs and other Muslims in centers where they were forced to undergo “patriotic education.” Authorities also ordered Uyghur students studying abroad, including in Egypt, to return to Xinjiang; and in July, Egyptian authorities rounded up those who had failed to return, possibly at China’s behest. By September, about 20 Uyghurs were forcibly repatriated to Xinjiang while 12 were released. Some of those who returned were detained; a Xinjiang court sentenced Islamic scholar Hebibulla Tohti to 10 years in prison after he returned with a doctorate degree from Egypt’s Al-Azhar University. In February, a video believed to be released by the extremist group Islamic State (also known as ISIS) showed Uyghur fighters who pledged to return to China and “shed blood like rivers”—the first reported direct threat by the group against Chinese targets. A 2016 study reported that at least 114 Uyghurs had joined ISIS, but estimates vary widely and the level of participation remains unconfirmed. In April, the Xinjiang Counter-Extremism Regulations, which prohibit the wearing of “abnormal” beards or veils in public places, became effective. Also in April, Xinjiang authorities issued a new rule banning parents from naming children with dozens of names with religious connotations, such as Saddam and Medina, on the basis that they could “exaggerate religious fervor.” Tibet Authorities in Tibetan areas continue to severely restrict religious freedom, speech, movement, and assembly, and fail to redress popular concerns about mining and land grabs by local officials, which often involve intimidation and arbitrary violence by security forces. In 2017, officials intensified surveillance of online and phone communications. Six UN special rapporteurs sent a communication to the government of China expressing concern about the late 2016 mass expulsion of monastics (monks and nuns) and demolition of living quarters at the Larung Gar monastery in Kandze, Sichuan. Similar expulsions and demolitions were reported at the Yachen Gar monastery in Kandze in August 2017. Several thousand Tibetans traveling on Chinese passports to India for a January 2017 teaching by the Dalai Lama were forced to return early when officials in Tibetan areas attempted to confiscate passports, threatening retaliation against those travelling abroad and their family members back home. In June, residents of Palyul county, Sichuan, demonstrated against land grabs; in July and August, Qinghai residents peacefully protested against several official policies. One solo protest in central Lhasa on June 23 ended in the protester’s suicide. Between October 2016 and March 2017, there were at least six protests in Ngaba, Sichuan, alone, but details are scant due to extreme surveillance and intimidation. Tibetans continue to self-immolate to protest Chinese policies. At time of writing, four had done so in 2017. Freedom of Religion <span class='card-underline'>The government restricts religious practice to five officially recognized religions in officially approved religious premises.

Shao’s church had refused to join the state-affiliated Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association. Beijing and the Vatican have continued negotiations on the normalization of diplomatic ties, but the dialogue remains strained by disputes over who has authority to appoint bishops in the country. In September, China passed revisions to the 2005 Regulations on Religious Affairs. The document, which comes into effect in February 2018, introduces new restrictions designed to “curb extremism” and “resist infiltration,” including banning unauthorized teaching about religion and going abroad to take part in training or meetings. Donations from foreign groups or individuals that are over 100,000 RMB (US$15,000) are also prohibited. The new rules also expand the role of local authorities in controlling religious activities. Authorities in Yunnan province charged more than a dozen Christians in 2017 with “using cults to sabotage law enforcement.” In October, at least three of the charged were given prison sentences of four years. One of their lawyers said the arrests were due to the group not gathering at officially designated churches. <span class='card-underline'>Women’s and Girls’ Rights </span>According to a report by World Economic Forum, China ranked 100th out of 144 countries for gender parity in 2017, falling for the ninth consecutive year since 2008, when it ranked 57th. The Party Congress, concluded in October, was marked by a striking absence of women in top political posts. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Women and girls in China continue to confront sexual abuse and harassment, employment discrimination, and domestic violence</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. </span>The <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Chinese government remains hostile to women’s rights activism</span></span>. In February, internet company Sina suspended the microblog of Women’s Voices, run by outspoken feminists, for 30 days. Between May and June, Guangzhou police forced five activists from their homes in retaliation for their campaign to raise awareness about sexual harassment on public transportation. In September, authorities finally lifted a 10-year travel ban on activist Wu Rongrong, enabling her to travel to Hong Kong for studies. Disability Rights China ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2008. However, persons with disabilities continue to face discrimination in areas including education and employment. In February, authorities released long-awaited Regulations of Education of Persons with Disabilities to replace out-of-date 1994 regulations. While the new regulations have some positive aspects, they do not go far enough in removing discriminatory obstacles that prevent many children with disabilities from being placed in mainstream schools. They require that students with disabilities be evaluated by a quasi-governmental expert committee and placed according to their “physical conditions and ability to be educated and adapt to [mainstream] schools.” Preventing children with disabilities from attending mainstream schools, or failing to provide them with support needed to attend such schools, is itself a violation of the CRPD. In March, state press reported the death of a 15-year-old with autism in a Guangdong “care center” for the homeless, focusing attention on neglect in these facilities. In a welcome move in April, the Ministry of Education issued a new rule to accommodate students with disabilities in college entrance exams, known as gaokao. While a 2014 decision already required schools to provide people with visual impairments access to braille or electronic paper in gaokao exams, the new rule provides more details on implementation and includes accommodation for people with other disabilities, including for deaf students. Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity While China de-criminalized homosexuality in 1997, it lacks laws protecting people from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, and same-sex partnership is not legal. In May, Chinese authorities shut down a popular dating app for lesbians. In June, the government banned “abnormal sexual lifestyles,” including homosexuality, from online video programs. <span class='card-underline'>In July, authorities forced the LGBT group Speak Out to cancel a conference in Chengdu. An earlier Speak Out event scheduled for May in Xi’an was also cancelled after police briefly detained the organizers and told them that LGBT events were “not welcome” in the city.</span> Refugees and Asylum Seekers Beijing also appeared to step up its campaign to forcibly return North Korean refugees and asylum seekers in 2017: between July and August, 41 people were detained; 51 had been detained in all of 2016. Key International Actors While the European Parliament, United States Congress, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, and individual members of governments and parliaments publicly expressed some concern about the deteriorating human rights situation in China in 2017, the response of “like-minded” governments to negative developments, such as jail sentences for peaceful protestors in Hong Kong, was even more muted than in previous years. Although the United States delivered a joint statement on behalf of a dozen countries at the March 2016 session of the UNHRC expressing concern at human rights violations in China, it did not present a follow-up joint statement at any of the council’s 2017 sessions. In January 2017, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres introduced President Xi at an event closed to civil society at the Palais des Nations in Geneva. Guterres made no reference to China’s deteriorating human rights environment or to human rights as a pillar of UN work. At a summit in Brussels on June 1-2, the EU Council and Commission presidents publicly “expressed concern” about human rights abuses in China, but did not call for the release of political prisoners, including EU citizens, or the repeal of abusive laws. The EU did raise concerns about China at the UNHRC in September. In June, German Chancellor Angela Merkel publicly challenged Chinese authorities to fulfill their commitments to register German NGOs under China’s new Foreign NGO Management Law, which went into effect in 2017. Also in June, Italian police briefly detained and later released Dolkun Isa, a prominent Uyghur activist and German citizen, as he tried to enter the Italian Senate, where he had been invited to speak. Italian authorities refused to clarify whether China had requested Isa’s detention. Australia failed to ratify an extradition treaty with China after protests from Australian politicians arguing Australia should not send people to China because the country's judicial system is plagued with human rights abuses. Businessmen linked to China’s government have made significant foreign donations to political parties in Australia, raising concerns about Chinese attempts to influence Australian policy. An Australian parliamentary inquiry in March called for a ban on political donations from foreign sources, and the government ordered a review of espionage laws. In July, the United States issued several statements condemning China’s failure to allow Liu Xiaobo the freedom to seek medical treatment wherever he chose. Yet within hours of Liu’s death US President Donald Trump referred to President Xi as a “terrific guy” and “a great leader.” Foreign Policy In May, China hosted its largest-ever gathering for the “One Belt, One Road” (OBOR) initiative, a development program spanning 65 countries that China says will involve investments of more than $1 trillion. Many participating states have a history of countenancing serious human rights violations in major development and infrastructure projects. Key international financial institutions, including the Asian Development Bank, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and the World Bank, have not taken adequate steps to ensure that they place strong human rights conditions on any participation in OBOR-related projects. At the UN Security Council, <span class='card-underline'>China joined Russia in February in a double veto of a resolution that would have imposed sanctions related to use of chemical weapons in Syria. In September, the council held closed-door discussions on Burmese military atrocities against Burma’s Rohingya Muslim minority; diplomats said China opposed language recognizing the right of return of the more than 630,000 Rohingya refugees who fled to Bangladesh</span>.

Anglo-American democracy was born with the Magna Carta to check the absolutism of King John in 1215 on the fields of Runnymede. Through succeeding centuries and periodic civil wars, the powers of Parliament strengthened and the powers of the King diminished. Landmarks included the Grand Remonstrance, the beheading of Charles I by Oliver Cromwell, and the English Bill of Rights of 1688. American colonists claimed the rights of British freemen. They soon took on the trappings of democracy with the Virginia House of Burgesses, the Mayflower Compact, the Connecticut Charter Oak, the Maryland Toleration Act, etc. The United States Constitution was not drafted until 1787, more than five centuries after Magna Carta. Democratic principles did not completely triumph until the Civil War Amendments ending slavery and enfranchising blacks, and the Women’s Suffrage Amendment ending their disenfranchisement in 1919. Blacks did not de facto enjoy the right to vote until the Voting Rights Act of 1965, more seven and one-half centuries since the road to democracy began at Runnymede. It was facilitated in the United States by a literate society, a homogeneity of ethnicity, culture and language, natural boundaries, and an unprecedented array of profound and selfless leaders, for example, George Washington and James Madison. Despite these vast advantages, the United States still needed a bloody Civil War and an obscenely prolonged period of Jim Crow before finally achieving substantial national unity and racial justice. In light of our own seven-century journey to democracy, the idea that we can install democratic dispensations in nations that are at the pre-Magna Carta stage of political maturity and lacking our peculiar cultural advantages is delusional. Our miserable track record speaks for itself, including South Vietnam, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Egypt, Burma, South Sudan, Somalia, Syria, and Bahrain. <span class='card-underline'>Taiwan moved into a democratic orbit in 1988 after the deaths of dictators Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo, and South Korea did the same after military strongman Chun Doo Hwan left office. But these democratic movements were indigenous. The United States was complacent with reliable, friendly, and anti-democratic leadership. At best, democracy promotion is harmless — like shouting at the weather. At worst, it is counterproductive. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Many societies are insufficiently mature, literate, and homogeneous to for its practice. Democracy in these places degenerates into majoritarian, sectarian, or tribal tyrannies notwithstanding formal elections</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>.</span> Russia, Iraq, Syria, Libya, and South Sudan are emblematic. Democracy is given a bad name, which may handicap its return at a more propitious time. Our energies should be devoted to purging the evils from our own democracy. We should then be satisfied with influencing developments abroad by example, simpliciter.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>The immigration courts are clogged, but proposals such as rehiring retired immigration courts judges to fix the backlog are coming now.</div><div class='cite'>Sanchez, Mercury News Race and Demographics Reporter, 7/13/18</div><div class='card-body'><p>[Tatiana, July 13th, 2018, Mercury News, “As immigration courts battle record backlog, retired Bay Area judges offer solution,” https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/07/13/retired-bay-area-judges-look-to-help-with-immigration-court-backlog/, 7/14/18, KC]</p><p>Spurred into action by the country’s overwhelming immigration court backlog, two retired Bay Area federal judges have asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions to appoint retired judges to help clear the more than 700,000 open immigration cases in the United States.</p><p>In a letter sent Thursday to Sessions and Executive Office for Immigration Review Director James McHenry, retired U.S. District Court judges Marilyn Hall Patel and Lowell Jensen urged the pair to use this “considerable resource” to alleviate the “crushing burden of pending and new cases.”</p><p>“We are aware that at this <span class='card-underline'>time </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>there are extraordinary burdens and backlogs faced every day by the country’s immigration judges</span></span>, particularly along the southern border,” the letter said. “We believe<span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>retired federal judges are a valuable untapped resource who could be called into service to assist in handling the immigration caseload fairly and efficiently.”</span></span></p><p>The backlog of immigration cases — which includes deportation hearings and asylum claims — increased by almost one-third under the Trump administration, with 171,656 cases added since the president took office, according to a June report by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, or TRAC, at Syracuse University. The number of cases awaiting decision reached an all-time high of 714,067 at the end of May, TRAC data shows. The group analyzes and publishes data it collects on the activities of the U.S. federal government.</p><p>That number is likely to grow, as thousands of undocumented immigrants have been seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border with their children in recent weeks. Decisions on granting asylum or another type of relief now take more than twice as long as removal decisions, according to TRAC data. Relief decisions this year on average took 1,064 days — up 17 percent — from last year.</p><p>Patel said long immigration backlogs are harmful to the cases themselves because it means judges are spread so thin that they don’t have sufficient time to devote to each case, no matter how complex.</p><p>“<span class='card-underline'>It means that not enough time is given to each case that is required,” she said. “That’s the problem. You can’t handle these things in-and-out.”</span></p><p>The Department of Justice’s Executive Office for Immigration Review, which oversees U.S. immigration court, declined to comment on Patel’s letter Thursday because the agency hasn’t received it yet but said it’s in the process of hiring more judges. There are currently 332 immigration judges nationwide, up from 273 in September 2016, according to spokeswoman Kathryn Mattingly.</p><p>In March, Trump signed a spending bill allocating an additional 100 immigration judge positions.</p><p>The efforts are part of the Trump administration’s push to slash the backlog in immigration cases in half by 2020. Aside from hiring more judges, the Department of Justice plans to use <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>new technology — such as videoconferencing — and increase judge productivity by setting case-completion quotas</span></span><span class='card-underline'>,</span> according to a 2017 Washington Post report. The agency also planned to tap retired judges to fill in on days when certain courts would be empty, the report said.</p><p>This week, Operation Streamline — a controversial federal program that orchestrates expedited deportation hearings for undocumented border crossers — arrived in California.</p><p>Patel, who retired in 2012, said retired judges are the best fit because they’ve already been vetted and have the security clearance and experience to take on the cases.</p><p>“The attorney general has the authority to appoint immigration judges,” she said. “Why not appoint some of the retired federal judges for a limited period of time to clear out this backlog?”</p><p>Patel was nominated to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California by President Jimmy Carter in 1980, becoming the first woman judge in the history of the district. She served as chief judge of the district between 1997–2004 — also the first woman to hold that post.</p><p>In one of her most notable civil rights cases, Patel in 1983 overturned Japanese-American Fred Korematsu’s criminal conviction for disobeying government orders to leave his Bay Area home and enter an internment camp during World War II.</p><p>Jensen, who also spent decades on the bench, was a deputy U.S. attorney general during the Reagan administration in the 1980s and a former Alameda County District Attorney.

Lynch Decision</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Asylum seekers often arrive with little to no corroborating evidence to support their asylum petition.</span>87<span class='card-underline'> Therefore, their narrative of the traumatic event, or events, is often their main evidence of the past persecution that they have suffered. </span>However, in Ms. Jimenez's case, she provided "over 400 pages of documentary evidence" with her petition for asylum, including the police complaint from her 2007 sexual assault, a doctor's report, and a psychologist's report.8 8 The doctor's report stated that Ms. Jimenez had 'visible signs and marks of a strangulation attempt' and a 'torn inner and outer labia of the vagina, evidencing penetration by force or with resistance on the part of the victim."'89 Similarly, the psychologist's report mentioned that she showed "signs and symptoms of tension, worry, fear for her life and the lives of her family[,]" and recommended that Ms. Jimenez 'be referred immediately to group therapy' to 'help her overcome the trauma."' 90 <span class='card-underline'>Despite having material evidence that corroborated her story, Ms. Jimenez's testimony was still not accepted as credible. This is a reality that many asylum seekers face. Despite their best efforts, their traumatic experiences "may not be accurately legitimated and accepted by outsiders," such as asylum officers or immigration judges.</span> 91 One must consider whether it is possible to effectively judge the credibility of a person coping with trauma within an adversarial system. <span class='card-underline'>Judges use factors such as demeanor, candor, and the internal consistency of each statement to determine an applicant's credibility.</span>92 However, <span class='card-underline'>these factors can be poor gauges when considering the difficulty many survivors of abuse or persecution have in articulating a linear narrative that effectively summarizes their experiences.</span> 93 Similarly, <span class='card-underline'>the applicant may feel shame or embarrassment in disclosing the abuse they suffered.</span>94 MS. Jimenez personally felt this: she testified "that she was ashamed and 'embarrassed' to discuss Holguin's abuse."95 Similarly, <span class='card-underline'>a shifting narrative may very well be an applicant's attempt to grapple with the extent of the trauma they have suffered, and thus, they may still be trying to reconcile their situation for themselves. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>In addition to having to accept the facts of their claim for themselves, applicants must also persuade outsiders that they can, and should, be believed</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span><span class='card-underline'> </span>As previously <span class='card-highlight'>mentioned, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the impact of past trauma can affect a survivor's conduct and memory</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span>96 While in detention, Ms. Jimenez did not immediately disclose to her detaining officers that she feared having to return to the Dominican Republic, "because she was nervous, afraid and ashamed to tell the male officer conducting the interview about her ex-husband's abuse."97 Upon expressing her fear of returning, she was given a credible fear interview.98 "<span class='card-underline'>Ms. Jimenez was confused and nervous during her credible fear interview, and embarrassed to be telling the intimate details of her relationship with Holguin to a complete stranger and an unknown telephonic interpreter."</span>99 However, despite these barriers, the asylum officer found Ms. Jimenez to have a credible fear of persecution and, thus, she was released. 100 In contrast, the immigration judge was not similarly persuaded and found Ms. Jimenez incredible based on "glaring inconsistencies."101 <span class='card-underline'>The issue with the current state of determining credibility within the immigration court setting is that the focus is not actually on the facts of the case, but instead the applicant's unwavering consistency in relaying traumatic details.</span><span class='card-underline'>102 Note that in Jimenez, the immigration judge overlooked the medical report, which noted the injuries Ms. Jimenez suffered due to the 2007 Christmas Eve attack 03 and instead focused on her timeline of those events-i.e., whether Mr. Holguin beat and raped her before or after the party on Christmas Eve.104 Thus, </span><span class='card-underline'>the immigration judge placed the emphasis on the time of the attack, rather than the actual attack. The persecution suffered was the attack itself, which could be corroborated with the medical report, psychologist's report, and police complaint. </span>The technical issues should not be completely ignored, because finding material inconsistencies may be a sign of a fraudulent asylum claim. <span class='card-underline'>At the same time, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>minor technical issues should not be the basis of an immigration judge's determination</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, especially where corroborating evidence exists.</span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>The Fifth Amendment guarantees asylum seekers, and more generally "person[s],"1O5 a due process "right to have a claim heard by a neutral, impartial arbiter."106 The importance of impartiality is reaffirmed in the Ethics and Professionalism Guide for Immigration Judges, which states that judges should perform their responsibilities without showing prejudice.10 7 However, </span><span class='card-underline'>an asylum seeker's fate will be greatly impacted by which judge presides over his or her case, as well as the region of the United States where the case is heard.</span><span class='card-underline'>108 </span><span class='card-underline'>While the national average asylum grant rate was 48% in 2015, many regions had much lower grant rates: Atlanta, Georgia (2%), Las Vegas, Nevada (7%), Dallas, Texas (9%), Houston, Texas (9%), Charlotte, North Carolina (13%), and Detroit, Michigan (14%)</span><span class='card-underline'>.109 Similarly, </span><span class='card-underline'>the United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) noted significant variations in asylum outcomes depending on the court's region and the judge hearing the case.</span><span class='card-underline'>110 For instance, "affirmative applicants in San Francisco were .. . 12 times more likely than those in Atlanta to be granted asylum."111 </span><span class='card-underline'>Some blame judicial bias and the role of politics in appointing immigration judges;</span>112<span class='card-underline'> others blame a backlogged and broken system.</span><span class='card-underline'>113 </span><span class='card-underline'>"</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Weighed down by </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>a backlog of more than 520,000 cases</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, the United States immigration courts are </span>foundering, increasingly<span class='card-underline'> failing to deliver timely, fair decisions to people fighting deportation 11 or asking for refuge.. . ."</span> 4<span class='card-underline'> This overwhelming case load also undermines the gravity of the decisions that immigration judges are being asked to make. </span><span class='card-underline'>115 </span><span class='card-underline'>The years of waiting</span><span class='card-underline'> injure asylum seekers because they </span><span class='card-underline'>face the reality that their evidence may become stale and their memory of past events will decay. </span><span class='card-underline'>For Ms. Jimenez, her hearing occurred in 2013, but many of the relevant events that she was expected to relay in detail occurred between 2007 and 2009.116 </span><span class='card-underline'>There was an expectation that Ms. Jimenez be able to remember and articulate, in a linear narrative, specific details of events that had happened nearly four to six years prior.</span><span class='card-underline'>117 In her case, the immigration judge was concerned about discrepancies as to details, such as what time of day she was raped on Christmas Eve in 2007, the exact date she was last raped, the location she was last raped, and whether Mr. Holguin had hit her son.118 There are general issues confronting a survivor's ability to articulate a linear narrative regarding traumatic events, but </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>these issues may also be compounded by the long length of time it takes to get a h</span></span><span class='card-underline'>earing.</span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>Aside from the problems created by the backlog of cases, </span><span class='card-underline'>there are also disparities in denial rates within jurisdictions that make judicial bias, political sway, and general inexperience more likely culprits.</span><span class='card-underline'> For instance, in July 2006, Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a research organization associated with Syracuse University, released a study stating that Chinese immigrants make up almost twenty-two percent of asylum seekers in the United States.119 The study found that in New York there was a grave disparity in the grant rates for Chinese asylees represented by lawyers-one judge denied almost seven percent of petitions, while another denied ninety-four percent. 120 </span><span class='card-underline'>Circuit courts have questioned the skill and temperament of some immigration judges, mainly those who have been repeatedly appealed</span><span class='card-underline'>.121 Note that </span><span class='card-underline'>"[a]</span><span class='card-underline'>bout</span><span class='card-underline'> half of the judges appointed in [the] 2004-2007 period had no experience with immigration law.</span><span class='card-underline'>"122 The purpose of the credible fear interview is to "identify potentially meritorious claims to protection."1 23 Similarly, </span><span class='card-underline'>USCIS training materials describe the credible fear interview as simply a "screening process,"</span><span class='card-underline'>1 24 </span><span class='card-underline'>yet</span><span class='card-underline'> in Ms. Jimenez's case</span><span class='card-underline'>, the notes from her credible fear interview held substantial weight before the immigration judge.</span><span class='card-underline'>125 </span><span class='card-underline'>The inconsistencies between these notes and the applicant's testimony often serve as the basis for adverse credibility findings without much concern about the reliability of those notes.</span><span class='card-underline'>126 In Jimenez, the Seventh Circuit found that Ms. Jimenez had consistently maintained that Mr. Holguin raped her on Christmas Eve and that the medical report corroborated her claim.127 Thus, the possible discrepancies-regarding the precise time of day that the violence occurred-between the interview notes and Ms. Jimenez's testimony, asylum application, and corroborating evidence was found to be a trivial discrepancy for the immigration judge to use as the basis for an adverse credibility finding. 1 28 More than that, the Seventh Circuit was concerned by how much weight was placed on Ms. Jimenez's credible fear interview, since it was not a verbatim transcript, and because it should not have been given more weight than </span><span class='card-underline'>all of</span><span class='card-underline'> the supporting 129 evidence she provided. Courts should question the reliability of credible fear interview notes due to the nature of those interviews. 130 The asylum officer's notes are the only record of the interview. 131 A verbatim transcript would provide a judge with more insight into the nature of the questions and answers, rather than a simple summary of the dialogue. 132 Similarly, a verbatim transcript would allow the judge to see whether the asylum officer asked relevant follow-up questions to seek more details and information from the applicant. 133 For instance, Ms. Jimenez's responses to some of the asylum officer's questions give the impression that she either "did not understand [the] </span><span class='card-underline'>question[</span><span class='card-underline'>] .. . or that the interpretation was unclear to her." 134 </span><span class='card-underline'>If the notes are only a summary, then the judge has no way of knowing whether the applicant's answers were evasive and vague, or whether the asylum officer failed to ask the appropriate follow-up questions to gain more insight into, and details from, the applicant's story</span><span class='card-underline'>. 135 Moreover, a verbatim record would allow the judge to interpret the nature of the interaction between the officer and the applicant. For example, the applicant may indicate reluctance in terms of talking to government officials based on negative experiences in his or her homeland.

After World War II, with the wounds of violent discrimination still fresh, the United States and its allies agreed at a United Nations convention in 1951 that accepting refugees was essential to preventing such atrocities in the future. Albert Einstein became one of the original poster children, literally, for refugee resettlement after he was banned, along with all Jews, from academic work in Germany. Mikhail Baryshnikov and other Russian ballet dancers followed decades later when they were famously offered protection from Soviet oppression in the United States and Canada. These cases were clear-cut in the public consciousness: These people were largely fleeing government persecution based on their race, religion, nationality or political views — four discrete categories for asylum under international law — and Republicans and Democrats mostly agreed on helping them. That consensus has dissolved more recently with the expansion of a fifth, much murkier, category of refugees, which has ballooned to protect victims of modern threats coming from nongovernmental entities such as gangs and terrorist organizations. Recently, claims have also been recognized from gay and transgender people in countries that persecute them and female victims of domestic violence in places where the government refuses to protect them. President Trump’s administration is in the midst of a targeted push to turn back the clock. “Asylum is for people fleeing persecution, not those searching for a better job, yet our broken system, with its debilitating court rulings, a crushing backlog and gaping loopholes, allows illegal migrants to get into our country anyway, and for whatever reason they want,” Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, told Congress in May. “This scamming of the system is unacceptable.” <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>More than 700,000 cases are now pending in the American immigration courts, with the largest numbers of people waiting from Mexico and Central America. The </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>growing backlog, plus a shortage of judges</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>, has steadily increased the wait time for asylum and other types of immigration cases, which now take nearly </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>two years</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> on average to complete</span></span>, according to data maintained by Syracuse University. One of the biggest blows to asylum petitions came last month, when Mr. Sessions overruled the case of Aminta Cifuentes, a Guatemalan woman who suffered a decade of abuse by her husband that included acid burns and punches to her stomach when she was eight months pregnant. Her baby was born prematurely and came into the world with bruises. Ms. Cifuentes’s lawyers argued that she was the victim of a larger crisis facing women in Central America. They presented a slew of reports by human rights groups as evidence that gender-based violence was a systemic problem that had been ignored by the police, and convinced a panel of judges that the existence of “a culture of machismo and family violence” in Guatemala meant that such women should be considered, for purposes of asylum claims, their own “particular social group.” Similar claims had been approved in the past, at the discretion of individual judges. But after the Board of Immigration Appeals laid down precedent by granting Ms. Cifuentes asylum, women from all over the world began to apply in droves using the same argument. Though the government does not track the grounds of asylum cases, lawyers and judges said that domestic violence had become one of the most common arguments heard in immigration court — until it became a useless one last month with Mr. Sessions’s new guidance to judges. “The mere fact that a country may have problems effectively policing certain crimes — such as domestic violence or gang violence — or that certain populations are more likely to be victims of crime, cannot itself establish an asylum claim,” said Mr. Sessions, who has the power to guide immigration judges on how to interpret the law. Mr. Trump and his allies are also concerned about asylum fraud, as well as the large numbers of people whose claims are denied but who stay in the United States anyway, slipping into an unauthorized life in the shadows. <span class='card-underline'>Of total asylum claims, which increased 1,700 percent between 2008 and 2016, </span>Secretary Nielsen told Congress, <span class='card-underline'>only 20 percent of applications are finally approved by a judge.</span> “So our concern is that there’s a lot of fraud,” she said. <span class='card-underline'>She pointed to the ever-growing number of people who journey to the United States because they believe wrongly that the doors of asylum are open to anyone.</span><span class='card-underline'> </span>“It doesn’t mean that you made a fraudulent claim, it could just mean that you believe that you can seek asylum, for example, for family reunification,” she added. <span class='card-underline'>“But our laws don’t allow you to seek asylum for the sole purpose of family reunification.”</span><span class='card-underline'> </span>At shelters along the southwest border, false hope is widespread, born of a combination of misinformation and wishful thinking. Asylum seekers have been sleeping curled around their belongings on a piece of ground in Nogales that marks the last patch of Mexico, waiting to be interviewed by American officials. In interviews with more than a dozen of these families over several days this month, most seemed to believe that if they attended their court hearings, they would be allowed to work and stay in the United States. Several people indicated that while Mr. Trump may have been separating families in recent weeks, they ultimately had faith that his administration would offer them protection. “This president is going to help me,” said one woman, Mary Montejo, 38, speaking from a shelter in Tucson. “He’s going to help me. I believe in my God, and I believe God has touched his heart.” In Nogales, Gilberto González, 63, a Mexican security guard, was keeping watch over asylum seekers. “This is painful to me,” he said. “They don’t know what faces them on the other side.” <span class='card-underline'>Other ideas for restricting asylum are being batted around Washington, according to officials at the Department of Homeland Security who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss them.</span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>Beyond eliminating asylum at the border, proposals have been floated to further toughen the “credible fear” test, which is the first step to winning an asylum case. Another plan would keep applicants in detention, or take away their right to work, until their cases are resolved.</span></p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'><span class='card-highlight'>Credible fear screening and deportation prevent family reunification and asylum</span></div><div class='cite'><span class='card-highlight'>Peñaloza</span><span class='card-highlight'> 7/20 </span><span class='card-highlight'>(</span>Marisa, Senior Producer at the National Desk, “Denied Asylum, But Terrified To Return Home,” NPR, 7/20/18, https://www.npr.org/2018/07/20/630877498/denied-asylum-but-terrified-to-return-home)//jjh</div><div class='card-body'><p><span class='card-underline'>Until recently, three out of four asylum-seekers were passing the credible fear screening.

If we shift our gaze away from the crisis in Central America that has prompted the large number of children and families arriving at our southern border, we see that many times asylum-seekers arrive alone at an airport, in a port, or via a land border. These asylum seekers—who are claiming their rights to safety after political or personal persecution— must take their place in line as US asylum court dockets fill. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>These solitary asylum seekers are a very vulnerable population with high levels of psychiatric morbidity, especially depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder</span></span> (Hocking, Kennedy, and Sundram 2015; Quiroga and Jaranson 2005). Importantly, <span class='card-underline'>many of these single asylum seekers have left spouses and children behind, and even if they are successful in claiming asylum in the USA, they may spend 5 years or longer waiting for asylum and another year or more for permission to reunite with their families.</span> The human cost to them—and to their children—of the extended asylum timeline includes lengthy separation from family (and delays in applying to sponsor one’s spouse and unmarried children who were under the age of 21 at the time the sponsor applied for asylum). <span class='card-underline'>We have seen this</span>, in turn, <span class='card-underline'>contribute to the following: enormous stress on the family unit (e.g., emotional, financial, childrearing, forced separation of family unit), loved ones back in the homeland having difficulty understanding why there is a delay (and, in some cases, not believing that the applicant is really trying to sponsor them), break up of marriages, and persecution of family members (including children) of torture survivors who remain in the homeland </span>(Berthold 2015). When asylum seekers flee their countries of origin, <span class='card-underline'>authorities may target their loved ones back home </span><span class='card-underline'>in an effort to</span><span class='card-underline'> find or punish the torture survivor who escaped</span> (Berthold 2015). <span class='card-underline'>Sometimes such asylum seekers may not know if their loved ones are dead or alive</span> (Akinsulure-Smith and O’Hara 2012). <span class='card-underline'>The persecution of family members left behind may take many forms including threats, intimidation, interrogation, torture, murder, abductions/disappearances, and being forced into hiding</span>. In hiding, families typically do not feel safe engaging in normal activities such as working or allowing children to go to school. They may relocate to another part of the country and even sever contact with family and other support systems. In some countries, the authorities have extensive networks, making it hard to hide anywhere in the country. Knowing this risk to their family members, asylum-seekers in the USA may be left in a state of fear and guilt due to their sense of having made family members targets of persecution. <span class='card-underline'>The asylum-seeker carries this burden even if his or her family members remain safe because the vulnerability is </span><span class='card-underline'>everpresent</span><span class='card-underline'>. </span>There are additional implications of the backlog, including a denial of a speedy resolution of the asylum seeker’s case. Asylum seekers are systematically denied the right to work<span class='card-underline'> (</span>UDHR, Article 23(1)), at least for the first 6 months after applying for asylum. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Without legal authorization to work, asylum applicants’ ability to support themselves and their family is jeopardized</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. If they do work under the table without a work permit, they can experience legal problems and may become increasingly vulnerable to exploitation and trafficking, including labor trafficking. Asylum seekers are also denied the right to access healthcare (including mental health care) until their asylum is granted. This deprives them of their right to the highest attainable standard of health</span> (UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 2000). Few health providers currently extend health services to the undocumented, with the exception of some large community based clinics and county health facilities. Obtaining coverage for emergency care for children is sometimes possible (through emergency Medicaid/Medical). <span class='card-underline'>Those who flee from persecution are at risk of experiencing psychological distress, and the stress of being in limbo waiting for the adjudication of one’s immigration case may prolong the uncertainty of whether they will be deported back to where they are at risk of being tortured or killed. Such circumstances can exacerbate psychological conditions and lead to hopelessness and despair. </span>Further,<span class='card-underline'> a long wait for asylum may compromise the psychological recovery process for trauma/torture survivors, thereby reducing their quality of life and well-being </span>(Berthold 2015). Conclusions and Recommendations The USCIS change of policy that prioritized processing of cases of unaccompanied children and other Central American families has had the effect of slowing down the asylum process for all other asylum applicants. Of course, we agree that the US government must direct resources to these children and their families, but it is unfair and unethical to divert resources from other vulnerable children and their families. Who can say whether a Central American child waiting in detention in Texas is at greater or more urgent risk than a child of a political dissident waiting behind in Ethiopia or Iraq? It is inappropriate to compare trauma and hardship across groups. Instead, we are in favor of a speedy resolution to all asylum cases, especially if those cases involve children—and whether those children are present in this country or abroad. Although we do not see their faces because they are waiting in their home countries for their parent to receive asylum (and then apply for family reunification<span class='card-highlight'>), </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the children of asylum-seekers also suffer when their parent’s asylum cases are put on hold or administratively closed, in effect delaying the parent’s eligibility to sponsor family members</span></span> (Haile 2015). <span class='card-underline'>The US Department of Homeland Security has hired additional judges and asylum officers in recent months—but huge backlogs </span><span class='card-underline'>remain</span><span class='card-underline'> and some immigration judges have resigned or retired. In at least some of these retirement cases, vicarious trauma and/or burnout caused by large caseloads, the pressure to complete cases quickly, and having to hear case after case of human suffering with graphic violent details may be a contributing factor to a judge’s decision to step down</span> (Lustig et al. 2008).</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Emphasis on “cultural” gender violence hurts the overall movement against patriarchy</div><div class='cite'>Montoya, Professor, Department of Women and Gender Studies, University of Colorado Boulder, Agustín, Associate Professor in gender and diversity, Department of Culture and Global Studies, Aalborg University, 2013</div><div class='card-body'><p>[Celeste, Lise, 2013, Social Politics, “The Othering of Domestic Violence: The EU and Cultural Framings of Violence against Women,” https://academic.oup.com/sp/article/20/4/534/1714604, accessed 07/14/2018, AMS]</p><p>We argue that the <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>emphasis on “cultural” forms of violence</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is harmful </span></span><span class='card-underline'>in several ways. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>First</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, it </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>obscures the degree to which gender-based violence is rooted in structural inequality</span></span>.

Analyzing human rights processes at UN level, Merry (2003, 974; 2006) argues that <span class='card-underline'>transnational elites in these settings often locate culture at the local, rural level and not among themselves, as “out there, in the hinterland, with the minorities, while here there is law, with culture hiding from view, buried in the everyday practices of modernity</span>.” From any perspective of “us”, minority groups tend to be viewed as more cultural (Phillips 2007). <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Third, </span></span><span class='card-underline'>the emphasis on </span><span class='card-underline'>particular forms</span><span class='card-underline'> of violence serves to </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>undermine the seriousness of gender-based violence in all its forms and perpetuates its normalization</span></span>. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>When</span></span><span class='card-underline'> certain forms of “cultural” violence are prioritized, the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>more commonplace brutality against women loses some immediacy</span></span><span class='card-underline'> as an issue needing to be taken seriously</span> (Narayan 1997).

However, the <span class='card-underline'>risks involved in the treatment of gender policy measures by technocrats have to do with the potential “depoliticization” of the issue of gender inequality altogether</span> (Squires 1999; 2005). <span class='card-underline'>This could </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>result</span></span><span class='card-underline'> both </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>from the presentation of gender equality measures as technical procedures that include no political conflict</span></span> and contestation, <span class='card-underline'>and from the exclusion of more radical feminist voices from the policymaking process</span> (Squires 2005 and Verloo 2005a). <span class='card-underline'>A further aspect of the technocratic approach to gender equality policy that causes problems for democracy is the extent to which </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>women’s wider concerns that are not part of the experts’ experiences might come to the fore only in a limited consultation</span></span>. While this duality of directions is used to describe and criticize a signalled “technocratization” of gender mainstreaming, it also has been criticized as a false dichotomy (Walby 2005). In some cases, the two sides do not necessarily oppose one another as much as reveal the political experiences of the formation of “velvet triangles” among femocrats, academics, and the feminist movement (Woodward 2004). These include, for example, Northern Ireland’s “participatory-democratic” approach to mainstreaming, based on the participation of civic groups in the policymaking process through consultations and hearings (Barnett-Donaghy 2003), and practices like the UK Women’s Budget Group,2 in which a union of academics, civil society, and policymakers has contributed to progress in the gendering of the government budget (Walby 2005).

Emphatically I state at the outset that in recognising the limits of how gender persecution is utilized in law, I do not suggest that we abandon it. Instead, I want to explore ways in which we might talk about women and the violence they experience in their communities, about interlocking systems of oppression, and specifically, about the ways in which there is First World complicity in both the sexual and racial persecution of Third World women. <span class='card-underline'>We must talk about First World complicity if the lives of refugees are to make any sense to us as Western feminists; that is, if we are to make any sense of the interlocking systems of oppression that produce refugees.

The number of cases awaiting decision reached an all-time high of 714,067 at the end of May, TRAC data shows. The group analyzes and publishes data it collects on the activities of the U.S. federal government.</p><p>That number is likely to grow, as thousands of undocumented immigrants have been seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border with their children in recent weeks. Decisions on granting asylum or another type of relief now take more than twice as long as removal decisions, according to TRAC data. Relief decisions this year on average took 1,064 days — up 17 percent — from last year.</p><p>Patel said long immigration backlogs are harmful to the cases themselves because it means judges are spread so thin that they don’t have sufficient time to devote to each case, no matter how complex.</p><p>“<span class='card-underline'>It means that not enough time is given to each case that is required,” she said. “That’s the problem. You can’t handle these things in-and-out.”</span></p><p>The Department of Justice’s Executive Office for Immigration Review, which oversees U.S. immigration court, declined to comment on Patel’s letter Thursday because the agency hasn’t received it yet but said it’s in the process of hiring more judges. There are currently 332 immigration judges nationwide, up from 273 in September 2016, according to spokeswoman Kathryn Mattingly.</p><p>In March, Trump signed a spending bill allocating an additional 100 immigration judge positions.</p><p>The efforts are part of the Trump administration’s push to slash the backlog in immigration cases in half by 2020.

This obligation is contained in the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The United States is a party to the Protocol and has committed to comply with the Convention’s protections for refugees.142 UNHCR has stated that asylum applications should be processed in a timely manner, condemning nations that do not have a just and efficient asylum processing system</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.143</span> The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which the United States has signed and ratified, preserves the right of access to the court in Article 14. The United Nations Human Rights Committee (HRC), established to monitor implementation of the ICCPR, says, “an asylum seeker must be allowed sufficient time to lodge their claim and conversely access to asylum procedures must be granted within a reasonable time.”144 <span class='card-underline'>Relatedly, the committee also states, “An important aspect of the fairness of a hearing is its expeditiousness.”</span>145 Applying the importance of expeditiousness to civil proceedings, which encompass civil immigration matters, the committee says, <span class='card-underline'>“delays in civil proceedings that cannot be justified by the complexity of the case or the behavior of the parties detract from the principle of a fair hearing.”</span>146 It further clarified that where “delays [in civil cases] are caused by a lack of resources and chronic under-funding, to the extent possible supplementary budgetary resources should be allocated for the administration of justice.”147 The application of these principles is illustrated by the committee’s 2003 review of Russia, when it concluded that the two-year delays in asylum adjudications were of particular concern.148 Other countries that receive high numbers of asylum seekers have time limits to adjudicate claims. In 2013, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union issued a directive of common procedures for granting and withdrawing international protection.149 Member states were instructed to “ensure that examination procedures are concluded within six months of the lodging of the application.”150 Under limited circumstances, the state is allowed to extend the processing time to “a period not exceeding a further nine months.”151 Furthermore, <span class='card-underline'>the directive sets an absolute maximum limit for adjudication of 21 months from the lodging of the application.</span>152 U.S. asylum law developed from international law instruments, primarily the 1967 Protocol which the United States embraced in 1968. To fulfill its international obligations under the 1967 Protocol, Congress enacted the Refugee Act of 1980, which incorporated key provisions of the Refugee Convention into the Immigration and Nationality Act. Importantly, the Refugee Act incorporated the refugee definition from the Convention and established uniform procedures for the treatment of asylum claims in the United States.153 U.S. law provides two indications of time limitations on the initial adjudications of asylum claims. First, initial interviews or hearings on asylum applications “shall commence no later than 45 days after the date an application is filed,” in the absence of exceptional circumstances.<span class='card-underline'>154 Statute also dictates that in the absence of exceptional circumstances, final administrative adjudication of the asylum application, not including administrative appeal, shall be completed within 180 days after the date an application is filed.”155 According to the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), as of September 2015, 61 percent of the over 100,000 pending applications at the asylum office have exceeded the 180-day requirement.</span>156 From 2010 to 2014 the number of affirmative asylum applications adjudicated past the 180-day requirement nearly doubled.157 For asylum cases adjudicated before the immigration courts, there is no statutorily imposed timeline. However, constitutional due process rights may demand the need for additional resources for the immigration courts, such that cases can be afforded adequate consideration by judges with caseloads that allow for fair and meaningful adjudication. The Immigration and Nationality Act includes a guarantee that “the alien shall have a reasonable opportunity to examine the evidence against the alien, to present evidence on the alien’s own behalf, and to crossexamine witnesses presented by the Government.”158 The Seventh Circuit indicates that immigration court procedures “must satisfy currently prevailing notions of fairness.”159 That court has also characterized the due process rights of immigrants to include the right to “meaningfully present” evidence in a “meaningful way.”160 Scholars argue that in order for judicial fact-finding to be conducted in a meaningful way, immigration judges must have sufficient time to review documentation and access witnesses. In an interview conducted by Dr. Alicia Triche and published in 2015, Judge Dana Marks, president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, indicated the following: A typical workweek includes 36 hours on the bench and a meager four hours of time spent in chambers. That is four hours to review documentation for every individual case occurring that week—a total that, especially if a law school or large firm is involved, can span hundreds or even thousands of pages.161 Limited time to review complex cases with often life threatening implications leads Judge Marks to characterize immigration court as “death penalty cases in a traffic court setting.”162 Ballooning backlogs cause immigration judges to face a growing number of pending cases, and increased pressure to examine them as expeditiously as possible. The large caseloads threaten the fundamental fairness required by due process. Conclusion Protecting refugees is a core American ideal, central to the country’s identity and history. As the asylum and immigration court systems struggle with large backlogs, those who need America’s protection suffer in a state of perpetual limbo. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>For thousands of asylum seekers, permanent protection in the United States is key to security and freedom from future persecution—protection now on hold for hundreds of thousand</span></span><span class='card-underline'>s</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>.</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>Uprooted by persecution, asylum seekers in the United States fully expect to struggle as they rebuild their lives. <span class='card-underline'>Yet extended delays in their cases make this struggle at times insurmountable.</span> Unable to reunite with their family or work or pursue an education or overcome the trauma of their persecution, asylum seekers must simply subsist for years—their lives hanging in limbo. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Continued and strengthened bipartisan support will be essential to secure the vital resources needed to reduce and ultimately eliminate the growing backlogs at the Asylum Division and immigration courts.

Historically, end-of-the-world scenarios have been popular topics in most cultures. In the early modern period scientific discoveries of changes in the sky, meteors, past catastrophes, evolution and thermodynamics led to the understanding that Homo sapiens was a species among others and vulnerable to extinction. In the 20th century, anthropogenic risks from <span class='card-underline'>nuclear war and environmental degradation made extinction risks more salient and an issue of possible policy.</span> Near the end of the century an interdisciplinary field of existential risk studies emerged. H<span class='card-underline'>uman extinction requires a global hazard that either destroys the ecological niche of the species or harms enough individuals to reduce the population below a minimum viable size.</span> Long-run fertility trends are highly uncertain and could potentially lead to overpopulation or demographic collapse, both contributors to extinction risk. Astronomical extinction risks include <span class='card-underline'>damage to the biosphere due to radiation from supernovas or gamma ray bursts, major asteroid or comet impacts, or hypothesized physical phenomena such as stable strange matter or vacuum decay.</span> <span class='card-underline'>The most likely extinction pathway would be a disturbance reducing agricultural productivity due to ozone loss, low temperatures, or lack of sunlight over a long period.</span> The return time of extinction-level impacts is reasonably well characterized and on the order of millions of years. <span class='card-underline'>Geophysical risks include </span><span class='card-underline'>supervolcanism</span><span class='card-underline'> and climate change that affects global food security</span>. Multiyear periods of low or high temperature can impair agriculture enough to stress or threaten the species. Sufficiently radical environmental changes that lead to direct extinction are unlikely. <span class='card-underline'>Pandemics can cause species extinction</span>, although historical human pandemics have merely killed a fraction of the species. <span class='card-underline'>Extinction risks are amplified by systemic effects, where multiple risk factors and events conspire to increase vulnerability and eventual damage. </span>Human activity plays an important role in aggravating and mitigating these effects. Estimates from natural extinction rates in other species suggest an overall risk to the species from natural events smaller than 0.15% per century, likely orders of magnitude smaller. However, due to the current situation with an unusually numerous and widely dispersed population the actual probability is hard to estimate. The natural extinction risk is also likely dwarfed by the extinction risk from human activities. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Many extinction hazards are at present impossible to prevent or even predict, requiring resilience strategies</span></span>. Many risks have common pathways that are promising targets for mitigation. <span class='card-underline'>Endurance mechanisms against extinction may require creating refuges that can survive the disaster and rebuild</span>.

But <span class='card-underline'>Sessions made clear in his ruling that he did not believe the responsibility fell on the U.S. immigration system, echoing the White House's long-standing complaints that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the asylum process is overburdened and prone to abuse</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. </span>"<span class='card-underline'>The mere fact that a country may have problems effectively policing certain crimes</span> — such as domestic violence or gang violence — or that certain populations are more likely to be victims of crime, <span class='card-underline'>cannot itself establish an asylum claim</span>," Sessions wrote. "In reaching these conclusions, I do not minimize the vile abuse that the respondent reported she suffered at the hands of her ex-husband or the harrowing experiences of many other victims of domestic violence around the world," Sessions added. He said his ruling would be binding on immigration judges. SESSIONS SENDS MORE IMMIGRATION JUDGES, PROSECUTORS TO THE BORDER <span class='card-underline'>The legal standard for obtaining asylum in the U.S. is strict, and ordinarily requires that people from foreign countries demonstrate they face serious, legitimate risks of persecution</span> <span class='card-underline'>by their government</span> if they remain in their homeland. But, <span class='card-underline'>not all forms of persecution are relevant for asylum consideration</span>. Under federal law, <span class='card-underline'>applicants must demonstrate that their risk for persecution is based on their national origin, race, religion, political views or membership</span> in a particularly vulnerable social class -- a category that was expanded in 2014, when the BIA ruled that domestic abuse could form the basis for an asylum claim. Declaring that his decision "restores sound principles of asylum and long-standing principles of immigration law," <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Sessions indicated that the move would help reduce the backlog of asylum claims that has risen sharply in recent years</span></span> -- with many of the claims illegitimate. "The vast majority of the current asylum claims are not valid," Sessions said in remarks Monday. "<span class='card-underline'>For the last five years, only 20 percent of claims have been found to be meritorious after a hearing before an immigration judge." Sessions added</span> that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the system is simply overwhelmed with claims</span></span>, and that bogus applications are crowding out legitimate ones. U.S. border inspectors begin to process asylum-seekers from migrant caravan; William La Jeunesse reports from Tijuana, Mexico. "In 2009, DHS conducted more than 5,000 credible fear reviews," he said. "By 2016, only seven years later, that number had increased to 94,000. <span class='card-underline'>The number of these aliens placed in immigration court proceedings went from fewer than 4,000 to more than 73,000 by 2016</span>." 1,000 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS SENT TO CALIFORNIA FEDERAL PRISON FOR DETENTION But Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, Jr. sharply rebuked Sessions in a statement Monday, saying his decision to "block tens of thousands of asylees from seeking refuge in our nation represents another triumph of ideology over morality – one that sets back the global fight against domestic violence and sex trafficking, and America’s standing in the world.” <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Sessions' move was widely expected after he announced his decision to intervene in the case three months ago.

Francis Cissna told The Associated Press that his office was preparing to look into immigrants who were ordered deported, but later may have cheated the system by obtaining green cards and becoming citizens using fake identities. USCIS is hiring dozens of lawyers and officials to assist in the effort, Cissna said, adding that cases would be referred to the Justice Department and could result in immigrants losing their citizenship or even facing criminal charges. "<span class='card-underline'>We finally have a process in place to get to the bottom of all these bad cases and start denaturalizing people who should not have been naturalized in the first place</span>," Cissna said.

In its 5–3 opinion Tuesday, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the court ruled that undocumented immigrants, asylum seekers, and permanent residents in immigrant detention have no inherent right to a bond hearing</span></span>—meaning that they could be held indefinitely.

The number of pending removal cases in the nation's immigration courts has steadily grown over the past 10 years, from about 170,000 in fiscal year 2006 to over 485,000 this fiscal year, according to records analysis by Syracuse University's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse. </span><span class='card-underline'>About 20 percent of those cases, which are overseen by the Justice Department's E</span>xecutive <span class='card-underline'>O</span>ffice<span class='card-underline'> for I</span>mmigration <span class='card-underline'>R</span>eview<span class='card-underline'>, are applications for asylum, in which an immigrant </span><span class='card-underline'>has to</span><span class='card-underline'> prove he is subject to persecution or danger in his home country</span><span class='card-underline'>, according to a recent report published by the nonprofit Human Rights First. Other deportation cases involve defenses such as people who have children who are U.S. citizens or people who are victims of domestic violence. </span><span class='card-underline'>Legal experts say a combination of staffing shortages, a 2014 influx of Central American immigrants — their cases have been prioritized by the immigration review office to move ahead of others</span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>— and a global refugee crisis have created a perfect storm. The backlog has stretched out the wait times for immigrants hoping to stay in the country, </span><span class='card-underline'>leaving them in legal limbo for years as they await their day in court</span><span class='card-underline'>. At Chicago's courthouse, </span><span class='card-underline'>the average case has a wait time of 1,046 days</span><span class='card-underline'>, according to the Syracuse clearinghouse. "We've been dealing with backlogs here in Chicago for a number of years now, and we've just seen them get increasingly worse," attorney Ashley Huebner said. Huebner manages the National Immigrant Justice Center's Asylum Project, a legal clinic that handles many of Chicago's asylum cases. In Illinois, hearings are held at the main Chicago courthouse and several detention centers statewide. "Our court is basically grinding to a halt at this point," she said. At the end of fiscal year 2011, there were nine immigration judges in Chicago, according to Kathryn Mattingly, an immigration review office spokeswoman. That number had dropped to five by early 2016. A sixth judge was added in April. </span><span class='card-underline'>Immigrants rush to apply for citizenship in last window before election </span><span class='card-underline'>At</span><span class='card-underline'> any time, these judges can also be re-assigned from their regular court dockets to hear the cases of people who are being held in detention centers, lengthening the wait for people like Jaime</span><span class='card-underline'>. There are currently 259 immigration judges across the country's 57 courts. In its report, Human Rights First recommended there be a total of 524 judges to ease the backlog. According to the immigration review office, </span><span class='card-underline'>this fiscal year's budget includes funding to hire 55 new immigration judge teams. Immigrants can also apply for asylum through the D</span><span class='card-underline'>epartment of </span><span class='card-underline'>H</span><span class='card-underline'>omeland </span><span class='card-underline'>S</span><span class='card-underline'>ecurity within a year of entering the country. But according to the Human Rights First report, </span><span class='card-underline'>the backlog in Homeland Security's eight asylum offices has increased fourfold since 2013</span><span class='card-underline'>. In March, interviews at the Chicago office were being scheduled for those who applied for asylum nearly three years ago. In Los Angeles, that office was scheduling interviews for applicants from 2011. The Human Rights report also recommended increasing the number of officers nationally who handle these asylum applications from 533 to over 700. </span><span class='card-underline'>I</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>f an applicant is denied asylum by the Homeland Security office, he can then pursue asylum in immigration court. Backlogs in both procedures mean the total wait time could add up to six years or more.</span></span><span class='card-underline'> "It's a ballooning problem in both systems," said Shaw Drake, principal researcher on the Human Rights First report. </span><span class='card-underline'>In addition to staffing shortages, the prioritization of Central American cases is contributing to delays in other deportation cases</span><span class='card-underline'>. These </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>other cases are being assigned hearing dates several years in the future and are subject to change as the courts process the priority cases</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span><span class='card-underline'> "The vast majority will be rescheduled for another date, earlier or later, depending on docket availability," Mattingly said in a statement. "(The Executive Office for Immigration Review's) response to the evolving situation on the southern border will continue to adapt appropriately." </span><span class='card-underline'>An increase in immigrants applying for citizenship Many permanent residents, motivated by anti-immigrant campaign rhetoric, are hoping to be eligible to vote for the first time</span><span class='card-underline'>. In 2014, the U.S. saw a spike in illegal border crossings by immigrants from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, including many families and over 50,000 unaccompanied minors. Additionally, </span><span class='card-underline'>asylum applications have increased as more people than ever worldwide are leaving their homes to seek safer conditions, fleeing conflict and instability in countries such as Syria, the Central African Republic</span><span class='card-underline'>, Afghanistan and Somalia, according to a United Nations report. Huebner said Chicago's asylum seekers are mainly from Mexico, Central America, and Central and East African countries. "</span><span class='card-underline'>The U.N. has counted the highest number of displaced persons around the world in recent history,</span><span class='card-underline'>" Drake said. "It has caused, of course, an increase in the number of people seeking asylum around the world." All these factors have made a difficult process almost overwhelming, immigration attorneys said. "</span><span class='card-underline'>We see this very devastating impact on asylum seekers due to these delays</span><span class='card-underline'>,</span><span class='card-underline'>" Huebner said. "It's been a real devastating impact on the family, on the clients' ability to have a stable existence in the United States and a severe impact on their psyche." </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Although immigrants can get work authorization six months after applying for asylum, many of them have left children or other family members in dangerous situations and can't bring them to the U.S</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>.,</span></span><span class='card-underline'> Huebner said. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Applicants won't be deported while their cases are pending, but they also don't have legal status</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. They can't apply for student loans if they want to pursue higher education or certain certifications for specialized work. "It's a frustrating process, and the emotions are quite high," </span><span class='card-underline'>Jarecki</span><span class='card-underline'> said. "</span><span class='card-underline'>They're not getting closure in their case and they have to think about the torture and harm</span><span class='card-underline'> (</span><span class='card-underline'>they experienced in their home countries</span><span class='card-underline'>), waiting for the day they can explain it in court. It takes its toll." Jaime said he left El Salvador to escape being recruited into a gang. "They want to make you become part of the gangs, and when you don't want to do it is when you pay the price," Jaime said. "All these things about gangs in El Salvador, you feel not safe. You can't go out at night." But the country is doubly dangerous for him because of his sexual orientation, which he hid before coming to the U.S. In El Salvador, Jaime said he saw gay people being beaten and targeted by the gangs. </span><span class='card-underline'>Now that people back home know he has come out of the closet and gotten married to a man, he said he especially fears being sent back.</span><span class='card-underline'> "I think probably if I was still living in El Salvador, I would be hiding," he said. "(In the U.S.) I wasn't afraid to go out and meet people. I never did in my country because of the discrimination." While Jaime awaits his chance to make his case to a judge, Benjamin has applied to sponsor him in the country through their marriage. They hope this will help Jaime get legal status faster. But </span><span class='card-underline'>this process is also lengthy and expensive, they said, and they are still waiting to be scheduled for an interview</span><span class='card-underline'>. "We're blessed we are here in this country where Jaime can come and has the opportunity to seek safety and to seek a better life," Benjamin said. "But the fact that it's going to take so long is just hanging over your head, always on your mind."</span> </p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Detained immigrants get funneled into private prisons where they are used as free labor</div><div class='cite'>Burnett, 17 (John Burnett, NPR’s Southwest correspondent and reporter, 11-21-2017, "Big Money As Private Immigrant Jails Boom," NPR.org, https://www.npr.org/2017/11/21/565318778/big-money-as-private-immigrant-jails-boom)///PSC</div><div class='card-body'><p><span class='card-underline'>The Trump administration wants to expand its network of immigrant jails</span>.

Critics are alarmed at the rising fortunes of an industry that had fallen out of favor with the previous administration. The Joe Corley Detention Facility is a sprawling complex surrounded by shiny concertina wire located in Conroe, Texas — about an hour north of Houston. <span class='card-underline'>ICE spends more than $2 billion a year on immigrant detention through private jails like this one</span>. The Corley facility is owned by GEO Group, the nation's largest private prison <span class='card-underline'>company. ICE and the U.S. Marshals Service pay GEO $32 million a year to house, feed and provide medical care for a thousand detainees.</span> Between 2013 and 2014<span class='card-underline'>, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Douglas </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Menjivar</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> was one of those ICE detainees. </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Menjivar</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> says he was raped by gang members in his cell, and when he reported it to the medical </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>staff</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> they mocked him</span></span>. <span class='card-underline'>ICE found the rape allegation to be unsubstantiated</span>. His lawyer has filed a federal civil rights complaint. Menjivar also says he was forced to work for a dollar a day. "Lots of things happened to me in Conroe," he says. He is a 42-year-old Salvadoran who entered the country illegally and is charged with violating a prior deportation. He's out now, fighting to get legal status in immigration court. Menjivar has become a bitter critic of immigrant <span class='card-underline'>detention centers, which are supposed to be holding facilities for civil matters, not prisons for meting out punishment</span>. The forced labor allegations are part of two class-action lawsuits in federal court. GEO "strongly refutes" these claims and plans to fight them. In an emailed statement, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the company says detainee labor is voluntary and immigrant workers are paid a dollar a day because that's the rate set by ICE</span></span>. GEO also says it provides "culturally responsive services in safe and humane environments," and that all of its facilities comply with national detention standards. Here's GEO's full statement defending its facilities: "GEO has a long history of providing culturally responsive services in safe and humane environments that meet the needs of individuals in the care and custody of federal immigration authorities as confirmed in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Advisory Council report in 2016 on privately operated ICE facilities. As a matter of long-standing policy, GEO does not take a position on or advocate for or against any immigration policies, such as the basis for an individual's detention or the length of detention." GEO also rebuts the class-action lawsuit filed in Colorado: "GEO has consistently, strongly refuted the allegations made in this lawsuit, and we intend to continue to vigorously defend our company against these baseless claims. <span class='card-underline'>The volunteer work program at all immigration facilities as well as the minimum wage rates and standards associated with the program are set by the Federal government under mandated performance-based national detention standards</span>. Our facilities, including the Aurora, Colo. Facility, are highly rated and provide high-quality services in safe, secure, and humane residential environments pursuant to the Federal Government's national standards." But these are just the latest grievances against the business of immigrant incarceration. <span class='card-underline'>H</span>uman <span class='card-underline'>r</span>ights groups, including Human Rights First, Human Rights Watch, Detention Watch Network and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights <span class='card-underline'>have compiled reports of medical neglect and deaths in custody. They claim corporations skimp on detainee care in order to maximize profits</span>. "<span class='card-underline'>I don't get the impression that the Trump administration has any interest in implementing new detention reforms</span>. <span class='card-underline'>If </span><span class='card-underline'>anything</span><span class='card-underline'> it looks like they may be eliminating some safeguards</span>," says Kevin Landy, who was director of the Office of Policy and Planning at ICE for six years. That office tried to reform federal oversight of immigrant jails during the Obama administration. He also advocated for raising the pay rate of a dollar a day, which was set in 1974. "<span class='card-underline'>I believe contractors save a lot of money by using detainee labor because they're performing work that would otherwise have to be performed by paid employees</span>," Landy says. That work includes cooking and cleaning the facility. But now, ICE is shutting down Landy's old office and moving the functions elsewhere in the agency. "It is incredibly scary to contemplate the notion that <span class='card-underline'>ICE would be removing even the dysfunctional oversight that currently exists,"</span> says Carl Takei, senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union's National Prison Project. At the same time, immigration authorities want to increase detention space. In its latest budget request, <span class='card-underline'>ICE has asked for more than 51,000 detainee beds — a 25 percent increase over the last year.</span> It's good business sense to have bed capacity in close proximity to where our operations are. Phillip Miller Immigrant advocates wish the agency would use more alternatives to detention, such as electronic ankle monitors. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>ICE</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, </span>however<span class='card-underline'>, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>believes lockups are the surest way to get detainees to show up in immigration court. </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>So</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> ICE is turning once again to the private prison industry</span></span>. "I think what's driving this is the administration wants to make a point that they're serious about immigration enforcement," says Lauren-Brooke Eisen of the New York University School of Law. She's author of a new book, Inside Private Prisons. "They're going to put their money where their mouths are and I think they're going to invest in more immigrant detention centers," she continues. <span class='card-underline'>The two largest private corrections corporations, GEO Group and </span><span class='card-underline'>CoreCivic</span><span class='card-underline'>, each gave $250,000 to Trump's inaugural festivities.</span> The Obama administration took the extraordinary step of phasing out contracts with private prisons that house immigrants convicted of crimes committed in the U.S. <span class='card-underline'>The Justice Department found these prisons fall short on safety and </span><span class='card-underline'>security, and</span><span class='card-underline'> are no cheaper than those run by the federal government</span>. Since Trump took office, the Bureau of Prisons has restored those contracts. And <span class='card-underline'>ICE is proposing five new private detention centers </span>— in Detroit, Chicago, St. Paul, Salt Lake City and south Texas. Traditionally, ICE has put its jails in border states close to where most people were caught. But immigration agents under Trump have been much more aggressive in the interior. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>They're psychologically mistreating immigrants</span></span>. Douglas Menjivar "As we continue to have increased operational control of the border, and the numbers of arrests on the border go down, at the same time our arrests in the interior are going up," says Phillip Miller, deputy executive associate director for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations. "It's good business sense to have bed capacity in close proximity to where our operations are." <span class='card-underline'>The changing arrest pattern is good news for private prison companies</span>. In a third-quarter earnings call last month, <span class='card-underline'>a GEO executive indicated that the government's need for additional detention space should benefit company revenues. </span>Back in Conroe, Texas, a second GEO jail is now under construction. That facility will house 1,000 inmates at a cost to taxpayers of at least $44 million per year. "But what they're building is another prison," says Menjivar, the man who was detained there. "For me it's a bad idea. They're psychologically mistreating immigrants."</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>The impact is increased structural violence </div><div class='cite'>Marguiles, 16 (Joseph Margulies, civil rights attorney, professor at Cornell University, August 24, 2016, 11-15-2013, "This Is the Real Reason Private Prisons Should Be Outlawed," Time, http://time.com/4461791/private-prisons-department-of-justice/)</div><div class='card-body'><p><span class='card-underline'>The D</span>epartment <span class='card-underline'>o</span>f <span class='card-underline'>J</span>ustice recently <span class='card-underline'>announced it would begin to phase out the use of private prisons</span> for federal inmates. We should cheer, but less for the reasons given than those the DOJ left unsaid. In her memo announcing the change, Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates pointed out that <span class='card-underline'>private prisons “compare poorly” to facilities run by the federal Bureau of Prisons.</span> The DOJ found that, in general, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>private prisons provide fewer correctional services at greater security and safety risk to inmates and staff, without producing substantial saving</span></span><span class='card-underline'>s.</span> These results are related. <span class='card-underline'>To achieve their modest savings, private prisons tend to cut back on staff costs and training</span>. More than a decade ago, researchers found that <span class='card-underline'>private facilities pay their officers less, provide fewer hours of training</span> and have higher inmate-to-staff ratios, a combination which may account for their much higher turnover rate among correctional officers, as well as the uptick in inmate assaults. This is the conventional critique of private prisons: <span class='card-underline'>They do not deliver on their promise of significant savings, and the greater risk far outweighs the small fiscal benefit they provide to those within the walls</span>. But the evidence for this critique is mixed. As the legal scholar Sasha Volokh has pointed out, some <span class='card-underline'>studies have shown that public prisons are more cost-effective than their private counterparts</span>, while others suggest the opposite. More importantly, Volokh argues that the private sector can be incentivized to improve—especially compared to the government—and that we should reform the model rather than end the experiment. If we accept the premise that private corporations should run prisons, Volokh’s argument has some force. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The real reason we should end the use of private prisons is not the conventional one. The real reason is that justice should not be administered through the prism of profit</span></span>. As a rule, we disfavor private prosecutors hired by the victim’s family, or judges who get paid when a defendant in her court is convicted but not when he is acquitted. In both cases, the concern is obvious: <span class='card-underline'>We mistrust arrangements that might lead actors in the system to stray from their duty to administer justice impartially</span>. The problem with the private prison is analogous, though not identical. The <span class='card-underline'>companies that build and run private prisons have a financial interest in the continued growth of mass incarceration</span>. That is why the two major players in this game—the <span class='card-underline'>C</span>orrections <span class='card-underline'>C</span>orporation of <span class='card-underline'>A</span>merica <span class='card-underline'>and the GEO Group—invest heavily in lobbying for punitive criminal justice policies</span> and make hefty contributions to political campaigns that will increase reliance on prisons. From 1999-2010, for instance, the Sentencing Project found that <span class='card-underline'>CCA spent on average $1.4 million per year on lobbying at the federal level</span> and employed a yearly average of 70 lobbyists at the state level. In California, where state law requires lobbyists to disclose their contributions in detail, we know that <span class='card-underline'>CCA used its resources to support, among other things, additional adult and juvenile prisons and detention centers and to oppose a bill that would have outlawed private prisons entirely</span>. These corporations have every legal right to shower money on friendly legislators. But the fact that they consider it in their interest to do so is exactly what exposes their troubling conflict. Especially today, <span class='card-underline'>when the systemic, deeply entrenched, racialized problems with the criminal justice system are increasingly apparent, we should not endorse strategies that encourage the expansion of the carceral state.</span> Regrettably, this was not the explicit message in the DOJ’s announcement. But Yates at least hinted at it. Before pointing out that private prisons “compare poorly” to their public counterparts—that is, before making the conventional critique—Yates noted that the number of federal prisoners has begun to fall, in part because of a shift in law and policy away from incarceration, especially in drug cases. As a philosophical matter, the Obama Administration is trending—albeit haltingly—toward a default preference for non-carceral solutions to crime. The best evidence strongly supports their preference. <span class='card-underline'>The endless churning of the incarceration cycle—</span>the thousands of young men and women repeatedly removed from their neighborhoods, returned and removed again—<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>systematically destabilizes the very communities we are trying to save by disrupting the intricate but fragile webs of connection that hold them together</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> In fact, research has shown that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>high incarceration rates of the sort we have seen since the 1980s not only destabilize disadvantaged communities; they </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>actually increase</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> the incidence of crime</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> That is why former Attorney General Eric Holder recently argued that as a nation, we should aspire to send fewer people to prison for shorter periods. This is precisely the opposite of what the private prison industry wants. While you can perhaps incentivize it to improve, you cannot incentivize a private corporation to go out of business. As long as we have private prisons, their corporate leadership will support policies that fill every bed. There are roughly 115,000 people incarcerated in private prisons: 25,000 in the federal system and 90,000 in the states. A corporation’s bottom line should not determine their fate. The DOJ has done what it could. It is time for the states to follow the lead.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Trump’s base support is high now</div><div class='cite'>Grace Sparks 6/7/18, Associate Producer, CNN Politics, "Trump approval ticking up in new poll", CNN, https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/07/politics/trump-approval-nbc-wsj/index.html</div><div class='card-body'><p>Washington (CNN) – President Donald <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Trump's approval has moved to 44%</span></span><span class='card-underline'> among registered voters</span>, <span class='card-underline'>according to a new poll from NBC/WSJ,</span> an improvement from the 39% approval he saw in April among all adults. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The number</span></span> of those <span class='card-underline'>who say they "strongly approve" of Trump has improved</span> as well, <span class='card-underline'>moving from 22% to 26%.</span> While this doesn't necessarily mean that the President has been adding new voters, <span class='card-underline'>it</span> likely <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>reflects</span></span> <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Trump's base moving back towards him</span></span> <span class='card-underline'>in fluctuations of approving or disapproving of his actions</span>, month to month.

In a 2014 article, Jonathan Keller and I argued that <span class='card-underline'>whether U.S. presidents engage in diversionary conflicts depends in part on their psychological traits</span> — how they frame the world, process information and develop plans of action. Certain traits predispose leaders to more belligerent behavior. Do words translate into foreign policy action? <span class='card-underline'>One way to identify these traits is content analyses of leaders’ rhetoric.</span><span class='card-underline'> The more leaders use certain types of verbal constructs, the more likely they are to possess traits that lead them to use military force</span>. For one, conceptually simplistic leaders view the world in “black and white” terms; they develop unsophisticated solutions to problems and are largely insensitive to risks. Similarly, distrustful leaders tend to exaggerate threats and rely on aggression to deal with threats. Distrustful leaders typically favor military action and are confident in their ability to wield it effectively. Thus, when faced with politically damaging problems that are hard to solve — such as a faltering economy — leaders who are both distrustful and simplistic are less likely to put together complex, direct responses. Instead, they develop simplistic but risky “solutions” that divert popular attention from the problem, utilizing the tools with which they are most comfortable and confident (military force). Based on our analysis of the rhetoric of previous U.S. presidents, we found that presidents whose language appeared more simplistic and distrustful, such as Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower and George W. Bush, were more likely to use force abroad in times of rising inflation and unemployment. By contrast, John F. Kennedy and Bill Clinton, whose rhetoric pegged them as more complex and trusting, were less likely to do so. What about Donald Trump? Since Donald Trump’s election, many commentators have expressed concern about how he will react to new challenges and whether he might make quick recourse to military action. For example, the Guardian’s George Monbiot has argued that political realities will stymie Trump’s agenda, especially his promises regarding the economy. Then, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>rather than risk</span></span> <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>disappointing his base, Trump might try to rally public opinion to his side via military action</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>.</span> <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>I sampled Trump’s campaign rhetoric, analyzing 71,446 words</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>across 24 events from January 2015 to December 2016. Using a program for measuring leadership traits in rhetoric, I estimated what Trump’s words may tell us about his level of distrust and conceptual complexity. The graph below shows <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Trump’s level of distrust compared to previous presidents</span></span>. These results <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>are </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>startling</span></span>. Nearly 35 percent of Trump’s references to outside groups paint them as harmful to himself, his allies and friends, and causes that are important to him — a percentage almost twice the previous high. The <span class='card-underline'>data suggest that Americans have elected a leader who</span>, if his campaign rhetoric is any indication, <span class='card-underline'>will be historically unparalleled among modern presidents in his active suspicion of those unlike himself and his inner circle, and those who disagree with his </span><span class='card-underline'>goals</span>.. As a candidate, Trump also scored second-lowest among presidents in conceptual complexity. Compared to earlier presidents, he used more words and phrases that indicate less willingness to see multiple dimensions or ambiguities in the decision-making environment. These include words and phrases like “absolutely,” “greatest” and “without a doubt.” A possible implication for military action <span class='card-underline'>I took these data on Trump and plugged them into the statistical model that we developed to predict major uses of force by the United States from 1953 to 2000</span>. For a president of average distrust and conceptual complexity, an economic downturn only weakly predicts an increase in the use of force. But the model would predict that a president with Trump’s numbers would respond to even a minor economic downturn with an increase in the use of force. For example, were the misery index (aggregate inflation and unemployment) equal to 12 — about where it stood in October 2011 — <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the model predicts a president with Trump’s</span></span><span class='card-underline'> psychological </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>traits would initiate more than one major conflict per quarter</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>.</span></p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Trump diversion <span class='card-underline'>outweighs</span> and <span class='card-underline'>complicates the case</span>.

In doing so this briefing focuses on the question of what a Trump presidency might mean for international relations with a focus on nuclear arms, including doctrine and disarmament. This means reviewing policies relevant to the US’s nuclear arsenal and pressing international challenges such as non-proliferation, including in East Asia and the Middle East, as well as the US’s relationship with Russia and its role in NATO. The power and responsibilities of the nuclear monarch The US President is solely responsible for the decision to use the near-unimaginably destructive power of the nation’s nuclear arsenal. Thus, as Bruce Blair—a former intercontinental ballistic missile launch control officer—makes clear, ‘Trump will have the sole authority to launch nuclear weapons whenever he chooses with a single phone call.’ The wider political meaning of the bomb for the world is aptly summarised by Daniel Deudney, who describes nuclear weapons as ‘intrinsically despotic’ so that they have created ‘nuclear monarchies’ in all nuclear-armed states. Deudney identifies three related reasons for this development: ‘the speed of nuclear use decisions; the concentration of nuclear use decision into the hands of one individual; and the lack of accountability stemming from the inability of affected groups to have their interests represented at the moment of nuclear use’. Similarly, Elaine Scarry has explained in stark terms in her 2014 book Thermonuclear Monarchy: Choosing between Democracy and Doom, how the possession of nuclear weapons has converted the US government into ‘a monarchic form of rule that places all defense in the executive branch of government’ leaving the population ‘incapacitated’. In response to this situation, Scarry argues that the American people must use the Constitution as a tool to dismantle the US nuclear weapons system, thereby revitalising democratic participation and control over decision-making. Scarry also outlines the incredible might the president wields, with each of the US’s fourteen nuclear-armed submarines alone carrying ‘enough power to destroy the people of an entire continent’, equivalent to ‘eight times the full-blast power expended by Allied and Axis countries in World War II’. Nuclear specialist Hans Kristensen has described how <span class='card-underline'>the US’s strategic </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>nuclear war</span></span><span class='card-underline'> plan ‘if unleashed in its full capacity’ </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>could ‘kill </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>hundreds of millions</span></span><span class='card-underline'> of people, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>devastate</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>entire </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>nations</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>, and cause </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>climatic effects on a global scale</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>’</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. </span>This war plan consists of a ‘family of plans’ that is aimed at ‘six potential adversaries’ whose identities are kept secret. Kristensen understands that they include ‘potentially hostile countries with nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons (WMD)’, meaning China, North Korea, Iran, Russia and Syria as well as a terrorist group backed by a state that has conducted a catastrophic WMD attack. The ‘dominant mission’ for US nuclear weapons within these plans is termed counterforce, meaning strikes on ‘military, mostly nuclear, targets and the enemy’s leadership’. Despite these plans, the US’s nuclear arsenal is often described by mainstream commentators as being solely intended to ensure mutual assured destruction (MAD), i.e. as part of the ‘balance of terror’ with Russia, in order to prevent armed conflict between the two nations and to ensure a response in kind to a surprise nuclear attack. However, as Joseph Gerson and John Feffer explain, rather than deterrence just being about enough nuclear forces surviving a surprise first strike attack to ensure MAD, US military planners have also understood it to mean ‘preventing other nations from taking “courses of action” that are inimical to US interests’. David McDonough thus describes the ‘long-standing goal of American nuclear war-planners’ as being the achievement of the ability to launch a disarming first-strike against an opponent- otherwise known as nuclear superiority. This has been magnified in recent years as the US seeks to ‘prevent’ or ‘rollback’ the ability of weaker states—both nuclear and non-nuclear powers—to establish or maintain a deterrence relationship. Taking all this into account, the new commander-in-chief’s apparently volatile temperament thus raises deep concerns since his finger will be on the nuclear trigger as soon as he assumes office on 20th January 2017. Given his past experience, Bruce Blair’s statement that he is ‘scared to death’ by the idea of a Trump presidency is but one further reason why urgent discussion and action, both in the US and globally, on lessening nuclear dangers—and reviving disarmament—is vital. A recent report by the Ploughshares Fund on how the US can reduce its nuclear spending, reform its nuclear posture and restrain its nuclear war plans should thus be required reading in Washington. However, as the Economist has rightly noted, ‘It is not Mr Trump’s fault that the system, in which the vulnerable land-based missile force is kept on hair-trigger alert, is widely held to be inherently dangerous’ since, as they point out, ‘no former president, including Barack Obama, has done anything to change it.’ Over sixty years after the nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, nuclearism thus remains very much embedded in the nation’s strategic thinking. Yet the election of Obama, and the rhetoric of his 2009 Prague speech, in which he stated ‘America's commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons’ led many to think that a real change was on the cards. Obama’s visit to Hiroshima earlier this year to commemorate the bombings was thus a painful reminder of how wide the gap is between the rearmament programmes that the US and other nuclear weapon states are engaged in and the disarmament action that they are legally obliged to pursue under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT). Obama himself said in Japan that, ‘technological progress without an equivalent progress in human institutions can doom us. The scientific revolution that led to the splitting of an atom requires a moral revolution as well.’ For this statement to be meaningful it is necessary to identify who is responsible for the existing, highly dangerous state of affairs. In short, the US government’s recent record supports Scarry’s suggestion that a democratic revolution is what, in reality, is most needed if the US is to make substantial progress on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. Short-term reforms towards the democratic control and ultimate dismantlement of the US’s nuclear arsenal have been outlined by Kennette Benedict, who writes that the next administration should: place our nuclear weapons on a much lower level of launch readiness, release to the public more information about the nuclear weapons in our own arsenals, include legislators and outside experts in its nuclear posture review and recognize Congress’ authority to declare war as a prerequisite to any use of nuclear weapons. Assessing Obama’s nuclear legacy In order to properly appreciate what a Trump presidency may bring, we need to revisit the range and types of powers bequeathed to the commander-in-chief by previous administrations. Despite the military advances made by China and Russia in recent years, it is important to recognise that the US remains far and away the biggest global spender on conventional and nuclear weapons and plans to consolidate this position by maintaining significant technological superiority over its adversaries, which will, as is well appreciated, push Beijing, Moscow—and thus other regional powers—to respond. Yet spending on nuclear weapons alone is set to pose significant budgeting difficulties for future US governments. According to a 2014 report by the James Martin Center, the Departments of Defense and Energy plan to spend approximately $1 trillion over the next 30 years ‘to maintain its current nuclear arsenal and procure a new generation of nuclear-armed or nuclear capable bombers and submarines’ as well as new submarine launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) and inter-continental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). Arms Control Today has found that total Defense Department nuclear spending ‘is projected to average more than $40 billion in constant fiscal year 2016 dollars between 2025 and 2035, when modernization costs are expected to peak’. Including costs for the Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration’s projected weapons-related spending during this period ‘would push average spending during this period to more than $50 billion per year’. If anywhere near these sums are spent, then the modest reductions to the US’s nuclear stockpile achieved during the Obama presidency will be entirely overshadowed. Moreover, as analyst Andrew Lichterman notes, the US’s continued modernisation of its nuclear forces is ‘inherently incompatible’ with the ‘unequivocal undertaking’ given at the 2000 NPT Review Conference to eliminate its nuclear arsenal and apply the ‘principle of irreversibility’ to this and related actions. For Lichterman, the huge outlays committed to the nuclear weapons complex were part of a political ‘bargain’ made by the Obama administration with Republicans. This ensured that the New START nuclear arms control treaty would pass in the Senate whilst also not disturbing the development of missile defense and other advanced conventional weapons programmes. New START is a bilateral agreement between Russia and the US, which Steven Pifer describes as ‘one of the few bright spots’ that exists in these nations’ relationship. Under the treaty Moscow and Washington must, by 2018, reduce their stockpile of operationally deployed strategic nuclear warheads to 1,550. Furthermore, both must keep to a limit of 700 deployed strategic launchers (missiles) and heavy bombers, and to a combined limit of 800 deployed and non-deployed strategic launchers and heavy bombers. Despite New START ‘proceeding smoothly’ according to Pifer, Hans Kristensen recently produced a report comparing Obama’s record with that of the previous presidents holding office during the nuclear age, which found that, hitherto, Obama has cut fewer warheads—in terms of numbers rather than percentages—than ‘any administration ever’ and that ‘the biggest nuclear disarmers’ in recent decades have been Republicans, not Democrats. Kristensen thus drily observes of this situation that, a conservative Congress does not complain when Republican presidents reduce the stockpile, only when Democratic president try to do so. As a result of the opposition, the United States is now stuck with a larger and more expensive nuclear arsenal than had Congress agreed to significant reductions. As his presidency draws to a close, presumably as a means of securing some sort of meaningful legacy in this area, it has been reported that Obama considered adopting a no first use (NFU) policy for nuclear weapons, something which, whilst reversible, could act as a restraint on future presidents. Yet this was apparently abandoned, according to the New York Times, after ‘top national security advisers argued that it could undermine allies and embolden Russia and China’. Furthermore, according to Josh Rogin of the Washington Post, the governments of Japan, South Korea, France and Britain all privately communicated their concerns about Washington adopting NFU. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter is also said to have argued that such a move would be unwise because ‘if North Korea used biological weapons against the South the United States might need the option of threatening a nuclear response’. However, as Daryll Kimball explains, the US’s ‘overwhelming’ conventional military advantage means that ‘there is no plausible circumstance that could justify—legally, morally, or militarily—the use of nuclear weapons to deal with a non-nuclear threat’. Such resistance to NFU is thus deeply disappointing given that, as Kimball goes on to note, this move would go some way to reassuring China and Russia about the US’s strategic intentions. It would also be an important confidence-building measure for the wider community of non-nuclear weapon states, showing that the US is willing to act in 'good faith' towards its disarmament obligations under the NPT. Thinking about the causes of proliferation more widely requires us to understand what drives weaker states to seek deterrents, if their reliance on them is to be reduced. For example, as Dr Alan J. Kuperman observes, NATO’s bombing and overthrow of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 ‘greatly complicated the task of persuading other states such as Iran and North Korea ‘to halt or reverse their nuclear programs’. The lesson Tehran and Pyongyang took is thus that because Gaddafi had voluntarily ended his nuclear and chemical weapons programmes, the West now felt free to pursue regime change. When assessing the importance of the Iran nuclear deal, which is often hailed as one of Obama’s landmark achievements, and which the next President must not be allowed to derail, it is thus important also to consider carefully what behaviour by the most powerful states will enable existing or potential nuclear possessors to embrace disarmament and reduce their interest in seeking non-conventional deterrents. The inability of Washington to make substantial progress towards reducing the salience of nuclear weapons at home and abroad is all the more noteworthy when one considers the state of US and Russian public opinion on nuclear arms control and disarmament. As John Steinbrunner and Nancy Gallagher observe, ‘responses to detailed questions reveal a striking disparity between what U.S. and Russian leaders are doing and what their publics desire’. For example, their polling found that: At the most fundamental level, the vast majority of Americans and Russians think that nuclear weapons have a very limited role in current security circumstances and believe that their only legitimate purpose is to deter nuclear attack. It is highly consistent, then, that the publics in both countries would favor eliminating all nuclear weapons if this action could be taken under effective international verification. Another important measure which the US has failed to hitherto ratify is the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). This is despite President Obama stating in 2009 that he intended to pursue Senate ratification of the treaty ‘immediately and aggressively’. Once more, there is notably strong public support–82% according to a 2010 poll by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs—for the US joining the CTBT but, again, the Republican-controlled Senate has blocked the treaty at every opportunity. Overall, the gap between the public’s will and the government’s inaction on nuclear issues is alarming and redolent of the wider democratic deficit in the US. On a more positive note, the fact that the citizenry supports such measures suggests that groups advocating arms control and disarmament initiatives should continue to engage with and understand the public’s positions in order to effectively harness their support. Stepping back from the brink In terms of priorities for the incoming administration in the US, <span class='card-underline'>stepping back from military confrontation with Russia and </span><span class='card-underline'>pushing the threat of nuclear war to the margins</span><span class='card-underline'> must be at the </span><span class='card-underline'>top of the list</span>. <span class='card-underline'>Whilst much has </span><span class='card-underline'>been made of a potential rapprochement between Trump and Putin, the two have</span>, reportedly, <span class='card-underline'>only just spoken for the first time</span> on the phone <span class='card-underline'>and still need to </span><span class='card-underline'>actually meet</span> in person to discuss strategic issues and deal with inevitable international events and crises, including in relation to Ukraine and Syria. As of now, <span class='card-underline'>whilst the mood music from both sides might suggest a warming of relations,</span> as has been seen with previous administrations, <span class='card-underline'>unless cooperation is rooted in a </span><span class='card-underline'>real willingness</span><span class='card-underline'> to resolve problems</span> (which for Russia includes US ballistic missile defense deployments in Eastern Europe and NATO expansion) <span class='card-underline'>then tensions can </span><span class='card-underline'>quickly re-emerge</span>. <span class='card-underline'>Another related question concerns how Trump will conduct himself during any </span><span class='card-underline'>potential crisis or conflict</span><span class='card-underline'> </span>with Russia or another major power, given the stakes and risks involved, as highlighted above. Whilst we must wait to find out precisely what the new administration’s approach to international affairs will be, in the past week, NATO’s Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told the BBC that he had been personally informed by Donald Trump, following the election, that the US remains ‘strongly committed to NATO, and that the security guarantees to Europe stand’. Trump had previously shaken sections of the defence and foreign policy establishment by suggesting that NATO was ‘obsolete’ and that countries such as Japan (and by extension others such as South Korea and Saudi Arabia) ‘have to pay us or we have to let them protect themselves’, which could include them acquiring the bomb. One reason why some in Washington have, in the past, not wanted their regional allies to develop their own nuclear weapons is because the US might then become dragged into an escalating conflict. Moreover, if an ally in one region seeks the bomb, this may cause others elsewhere to pursue their own capabilities- an act of strategic independence that might make these states harder to influence and control. The US’s key relationships in East Asia and the Middle East illustrate why, if a future US President wishes to take meaningful moves towards a world free of nuclear weapons, then developing alternative regional political agreements, including strategic cooperation with China and Russia, will be necessary. As Nancy Gallagher rightly notes, the ‘weaknesses of existing international organizations’ thus requires ‘more inclusive, cooperative security institutions’ to be constructed regionally ‘to complement and someday, perhaps, to replace exclusive military alliances’, alongside progressive demilitarisation. Such confidence-building measures would also support efforts to halt missile and nuclear tests by states such as North Korea, which may soon be capable of striking the US mainland. Imagining the next enemy As well as mapping out the US’s current nuclear weapons policies and its regional relationships, <span class='card-underline'>it is important to reflect upon how </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>domestic political dynamics</span></span> <span class='card-underline'>under</span> a <span class='card-underline'>Trump</span> presidency <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>might drive Washington’s </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>behaviour</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> internationally</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, particularly </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>given the </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>nuclear shadow</span></span> <span class='card-underline'>that always hangs over conflicts involving the US. </span>For example, in the near-term, Trump’s economic plan and the great expectations amongst the American working class that have been generated, may have particularly dangerous consequences if, as seems likely, the primary beneficiaries are the very wealthy. Reviewing Trump’s economic plans, Martin Wolf of the Financial Times concludes that ‘<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the longer-term consequences are</span></span> likely to be <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>grim</span></span>, not least <span class='card-underline'>for </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>his</span></span><span class='card-underline'> angry, but fooled, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>supporters</span></span>. <span class='card-underline'>Next time, they </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>might be even angrier</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. Where</span><span class='card-underline'> that might lead is terrifying’</span>. Gillian Tett has also highlighted the ‘real risks’ that Trump’s policies could ‘spark US social unrest or geopolitical uncertainty’. Elsewhere, George Monbiot in the Guardian, makes the stark assertion that the inability of the US and other governments to respond effectively to public anger means he now believes that ‘<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>we will see war between</span></span><span class='card-underline'> the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>major powers</span></span> within my lifetime’. If these warnings weren’t troubling enough, no less a figure than Henry Kissinger argued on BBC’s Newsnight that ‘the more likely reaction’ to a Trump presidency from terror groups ‘will be to do something that evokes a reaction’ from Washington in order to ‘widen the split’ between it and Europe and damage the US’s image around the world. Given that Trump has already vowed to ‘bomb the shit out of ISIS’ and refused to rule out the use of nuclear weapons against the group, it goes without saying that such a scenario could have the gravest consequences and must be avoided so that the US does not play into the terrorists’ hands. Looking more widely, President-elect Trump’s existing and potential cabinet appointments, which Glenn Greenwald has summarised as ‘empowering…by and large…the traditional, hard, hawkish right-wing members of the Republican Party’ also point to the US engaging in future overseas conflicts, rather than the isolationism which many in the foreign policy establishment criticised Trump for proposing during the presidential campaign. William Hartung and Todd Harrison have drawn attention to the fact that defence spending under Trump could be almost $1trillion (spread over ten years) more than Obama’s most recent budget request. Such projections, alongside Trump’s election rhetoric, suggest that the new nuclear monarch will try to push wide open the door to more spending on nuclear weapons and missile defense, a situation made possible, as we have seen, by Obama’s inability to implement progressive change in this area at a time of persistent Republican obstruction. Conclusion The problem now, for the US and the world, is that if Trump does make good on his campaign promises then this will have several damaging consequences for international peace and security and that <span class='card-underline'>if Trump does not sufficiently satisfy his supporters then this will</span> likely <span class='card-underline'>pour fuel on the flames at home</span>, <span class='card-underline'>which may then </span><span class='card-underline'>quickly spread abroad</span>. The people of the US and the world thus now have a huge responsibility to act as a restraining influence and ensure that the US retains an accountable, transparent and democratic government. This responsibility will only grow if crises or shocks take place in or outside the US which ambitious and extremist figures take advantage of, framing them as threats to national security in order to protect their interests and power. If such scenarios emerge the next administration and its untried and untested President will find themselves with a range of extremely powerful tools and institutional experience at their disposal, including <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>nuclear weapons</span></span>, which <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>may prove </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>too tempting to resist</span></span> <span class='card-underline'>when figuring out how to respond to widespread anger, confusion and unrest, both at home and abroad</span>.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Base support is high and increasing now – the most recent national polls show Trump’s approval rating increasing, especially with Republicans and rural voters who are the core of his constituency – that’s Sparks

Then there is the subject that touches every American — the economy — and Trump is doing so well on that front that even the New York Times had to admit it “ran out of words to describe how good the job numbers are.” Since Trump took office, nearly 3 million jobs have been created, and wage growth is at the highest point since President Bush left office. Unemployment has dipped to its lowest level since 2000 and to record lows for African Americans and Asians. Manufacturing jobs are increasingacross the country, and two-thirds of Americans say the economy is “good.” On top of that, efforts by Obama supporters to give their man credit for the economic numbers have crumbled in recent months. Republican congressional candidates are right to worry whether Trump’s coattails and loyal supporters are enough to keep them in control of Congress beyond this year. The Senate seems safe for now. But the battle for control of the House remains a toss-up, Democrats continue to hold a small-but-stubborn lead in the generic ballot question, and there is no guarantee, particularly as political turmoil in Italy threatens the European Union economy, the economy still will be a political plus come November. <span class='card-underline'>There is no-one-size-fits-all solution for Republicans to win in 2018</span>.

Six in 10 registered voters told Pew that their congressional vote this year will be explicitly meant as a vote for or against Trump, a higher percentage of voters weighing in specifically to send a message to the chief executive than in any of the prior three midterm elections. In 2014, 48 percent of voters said their goal was to give an electoral thumbs up or thumbs down to President Barack Obama. All of the figures above are from June or July prior to the midterm election. What’s particularly interesting, though, is that the split between for and against isn’t as lopsided as one might think. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Trump’s</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>approval numbers have been creeping upward</span></span><span class='card-underline'> of late</span>, but he’s still unpopular and faces strong disapproval from a lot of Americans. But more <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>people</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>say that their vote is meant to send a message of support</span></span><span class='card-underline'> for Trump</span> than said the same about George W. Bush in 2006 or Obama in 2010 or 2014. Why? Because <span class='card-underline'>more than half of those in Trump’s own party say that’s a factor in their congressional vote</span> — the highest percentage of same-party voters to say that’s their motivation since 2006. The percent of Democrats saying their vote is in opposition to Trump is higher than the opposing votes from Republicans in 2010 or 2014 but lower than the enthusiasm Democrats had in 2006 to oppose Bush. It’s important to remember, in case you’d forgotten, that <span class='card-underline'>just as there is robust disapproval of Trump</span> <span class='card-underline'>there is also</span> robust <span class='card-underline'>approval</span> from a smaller segment of the population. We’ve noted before that the combined strong approval and strong disapproval Trump has seen since taking office has been higher than we saw under his two predecessors, with the exception of the bump Bush saw after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Trump has fostered that</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>keeping a </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>deliberate focus on his base</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>and</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>ensuring that the promises he made to them are fulfilled</span></span>. Whether his base would have wavered anyway isn’t clear, but they haven’t. And <span class='card-underline'>so now</span> more than half of <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Republicans</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>specifically plan to vote for Republicans to show their </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>support for him</span></span>. Another way of looking at how that’s unusual is to consider the gaps between those saying they want to cast a vote for or against the president and the gaps between the opposition and the president’s party. In 2006, both gaps were wide: Much more intent to vote in opposition to Bush than to vote in support and much more energy among Democrats against him than Republicans for him. Compare that with 2018, when the overall for-against gap is the second narrowest since 2006 (minus-8) and the gap between the parties is the overall narrowest (9 points). In 2006, those wide gaps led to the Democrats gaining 61 seats and control of the House. The implication is that narrower gaps may not have a similar result. Except when one considers those gaps in 2010 and 2014. In 2010, the Republicans saw a swing of 126 seats in their direction, with only modest gaps between for and against and between Democrats and Republicans a few months out. We’ve noted before that the surges to the Republicans in 2010 and 2014 happened closer to the election.

At this point, that's old news. But not everyone has a good grasp on the granular parts of presidential approval?how intensely people feel about the president, which groups do and don't like him and how much that matters for the midterms and our understanding of public opinion in the Trump era more generally. That's why <span class='card-underline'>I spent</span> some <span class='card-underline'>time with a </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>new, centralized data</span></span><span class='card-underline'>set</span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>from</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>SurveyMonkey</span></span> that deals with these questions. I looked through their data, did some math, and came up with four different charts that demonstrate some of the most important facts about Trump's approval rating. Before getting started, I have one quick note for readers who might be confused because they have personal experience either making or filling out very non-political polls on SurveyMonkey. This is that same SurveyMonkey ? the company just also usse its platform to conduct scientific political surveys. Mark Blumenthal, head of election polling, explained it to me: "We draw random samples of those who have just completed a survey on our platform and invite them to answer a few more questions about important issues and current events, including Trump approval" and then they "statistically adjust the data so it is representative of the American public." So here are the graphics and the explanations: There Aren't (And Never Have Been) Many Lukewarm Trump Disapprovers The conventional wisdom on politics is often wrong. But these polls show that it's right about one thing ? Americans who don't like Trump really don't like him. This graphic shows the percentage of Trump disapprovers who "strongly" or "somewhat" disapprove of Trump's job performance in a series of SurveyMonkey polls stretching from January 2017 to now. The top line tells most of the story. If you put every American who disapproves of Trump in a room (usually more than half of the people that SurveyMonkey polls) and picked someone randomly, the odds of picking a "strong disapprover" would be greater than 3-to-1. This is a problem for down-ballot Republicans. Democrats have won some high profile races (like the special election in Pennsylvania's 18th District) partially by riding strong anti-Trump sentiment. The president has motived Democrats to turn out at a high rate while driving some more typical GOP voters to cast their ballot for the blue team. That anti-Trump enthusiasm is part of the reason Democrats are currently the favorites to take the House in November. <span class='card-underline'>Trump's Base is More Divided Than Many Think</span><span class='card-underline'> </span>The conventional wisdom is a little less helpful when it comes to Trump supporters.

Maybe more interestingly, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the mix</span></span><span class='card-underline'> of somewhat and strong Trump approvers seems to have </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>changed</span></span><span class='card-underline'> at least </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>a little bit</span></span><span class='card-underline'> over time. </span>Every poll is noisy, so these shifts shouldn't be overinterpreted.

Indeed, <span class='card-underline'>there are a couple of reasons to think many white evangelicals will react differently than their leaders who have criticized Trump</span>. Understanding evangelicals’ broader perspective on immigration can also help illuminate why this group continues to support Trump so strongly — despite recent scandals that appear to fly in the face of evangelicals’ values.1 First, <span class='card-underline'>polling on white evangelical Protestants has shown that</span> <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>they’re more likely than </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>any other religious group</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>to support </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>hardline immigration policies</span></span> and to have negative views of immigrants overall. A recent survey by the Pew Research Center found that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>70 percent</span></span> <span class='card-underline'>of white evangelical Protestants </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>are in favor of </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>expanding the border wall</span></span> between the U.S. and Mexico, compared with only around half of white mainline Protestants and white Catholics and much lower shares of other religious groups.

They were also the likeliest to say that they have little or nothing in common with immigrants. Daniel Cox, the research director at PRRI,2 said these findings help explain why <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>evangelicals</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>aren’t likely to abandon Trump</span></span><span class='card-underline'> over the child separation crisis</span>, <span class='card-underline'>even if they’re troubled by it</span>. “More than other groups, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>white evangelical Protestants seem to perceive immigrants as a </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>threat to American society</span></span>,” he said. “So <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>even if they don’t like this particular policy</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>they’re on board with Trump’s approach to immigration in general</span></span>, <span class='card-underline'>and that makes it likelier that they’ll see this as a </span><span class='card-underline'>tactical misstep</span><span class='card-underline'> rather than a </span><span class='card-underline'>breaking point</span>.” That’s also how some evangelical leaders have responded; for example, Jentezen Franklin, a Georgia megachurch pastor who serves on Trump’s evangelical advisory council, criticized the family separation policy in an interview with FiveThirtyEight but blamed Congress — rather than Trump — for failing to act. “The president really cares for these families, but to permanently fix the problem, he needs Congress to do their job and work with him on border security,” Franklin said, adding that many evangelicals were drawn to Trump because of his emphasis on reducing the number of undocumented immigrants in the U.S.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>The base doesn’t really care</div><div class='cite'>Dylan Matthews 6/18/18, Vox politics correspondent, "Polls: Trump’s family separation policy is very unpopular — except among Republicans", Vox, https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/6/18/17475740/family-separation-poll-polling-border-trump-children-immigrant-families-parents</div><div class='card-body'><p>Two new <span class='card-underline'>polls find that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the US government policy of separating children from their parents</span></span> at the Mexican border <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is</span></span><span class='card-underline'> very </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>unpopular</span></span> with the general public <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>but</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> retains majority support among Republicans</span></span>. A new Quinnipiac University poll, released Monday, asked voters, “As you may know, some families seeking asylum from their home country cross the U.S. border illegally and then request asylum. In an attempt to discourage this, the Trump administration has been prosecuting the parents immediately, which means separating parents from their children. Do you support or oppose this policy?” As my colleague Dara Lind notes, this characterizes most of the reason for family separation, though some families seeking asylum legally at ports of entry have also been separated. Sixty-six percent of voters — including <span class='card-underline'>91 percent of Democrats</span> and 68 percent of independents — <span class='card-underline'>told Quinnipiac they opposed the policy</span>. Whites with college degrees were likelier than non-college whites to oppose the policy, and young people of all races were likelier to oppose it than old people. Women were likelier to oppose the policy than men, and black and Hispanic Americans were more likely to oppose it than whites (though a large majority of whites still oppose the policy). <span class='card-underline'>But </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>by a </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>large, 20-point</span></span> (55 percent to 35 percent) <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>margin</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Republicans supported the policy</span></span>: <span class='card-underline'>A poll conducted by Ipsos exclusively for the Daily Beast found similar results</span>. Ipsos asked respondents if they agreed with this statement: “It is appropriate to separate undocumented immigrant parents from their children when they cross the border in order to discourage others from crossing the border illegally.” The wording is slightly different from the Quinnipiac poll, foregrounding the deterrence rationale the Trump administration has used to defend the policy. Fifty-five percent of respondents stated they disagreed (42 percent “strongly” disagreed), while 27 percent agreed. As in the Quinnipiac poll, women and nonwhite people were likelier to disagree with the policy; unlike the Quinnipiac poll, differences based on education were minimal, and 18- to 34-year-olds and 35- to 54-year-olds had similar opinions. (People 55 and up were likelier to support the policy.) And as in the Quinnipiac poll, <span class='card-underline'>more Republicans approved of the policy than not</span> (46 percent to 32 percent). Note that unlike the Quinnipiac poll, the Ipsos poll found only a plurality of Republicans supporting family separation, not a majority. Chris Warshaw, a political scientist at George Washington University, notes that both the Quinnipiac and Ipsos polling suggests the policy is less popular than any major policy proposal of recent American history, including the extremely unpopular Obamacare repeal bills of last summer: [tweet omitted] Nonetheless, the polls find that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Trump’s</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>core Republican base supports family separation</span></span>. But when interpreting party-based polling, one should keep in mind the finding by Emory political scientists Pablo Montagnes, Zachary Peskowitz, and Joshua McCrain that Trump’s unpopularity has coincided with fewer people identifying as Republicans. That could mean that Republicans who disagree with Trump, and in particular his immigration policies, are likelier to identify as independents rather than Republicans now, which in turn artificially inflates support for Trump among self-identified Republicans. If you polled people who identified as Republicans as of November 2016 and asked what they think of the family separation policy, you might get different results.

In short, an increasingly large chunk of Americans believes a whole bunch of crazy things, and it is warping our politics. This basic story has been told plenty of times (my longer version is here), but the reason we should not let it out of our sights right now is the Mueller investigation. As Ezra Klein laid out, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>there is enough on the record</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span>now <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>to make it </span></span><span class='card-underline'>at the very least </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>highly probable</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span>that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>there was collusion </span></span><span class='card-underline'>between</span> the <span class='card-underline'>Trump</span> campaign <span class='card-underline'>and Russia</span>, <span class='card-underline'>meant to affect the</span> outcome of the <span class='card-underline'>election</span>.

What if there is no longer any evidentiary standard that could overcome the influence of right-wing media? The US is undergoing an epistemic breach Epistemology is the branch of philosophy having to do with how we know things and what it means for something to be true or false, accurate or inaccurate. (Episteme, or ἐπιστήμη, is ancient Greek for knowledge/science/understanding.) The US is experiencing a deep epistemic breach, a split not just in what we value or want, but in who we trust, how we come to know things, and what we believe we know — what we believe exists, is true, has happened and is happening. The primary source of this breach, to make a long story short, is the US conservative movement’s rejection of the mainstream institutions devoted to gathering and disseminating knowledge (journalism, science, the academy) — the ones society has appointed as referees in matters of factual dispute. In their place, <span class='card-underline'>the right has created its own</span> parallel set of institutions, most notably its own <span class='card-underline'>media ecosystem</span>. But the right’s institutions are not of the same kind as the ones they seek to displace. Mainstream scientists and journalists see themselves as beholden to values and standards that transcend party or faction. They try to separate truth from tribal interests and have developed various guild rules and procedures to help do that. They see themselves as neutral arbiters, even if they do not always uphold that ideal in practice. The pretense for the conservative revolution was that mainstream institutions had failed in their role as neutral arbiters — that they had been taken over by the left, become agents of the left in referee’s clothing, as it were. But the right did not want better neutral arbiters. The institutions it built scarcely made any pretense of transcending faction; they are of and for the right. There is nominal separation of conservative media from conservative politicians, think tanks, and lobbyists, but in practice, they are all part of the conservative movement. They are prosecuting its interests; that is the ur-goal. Indeed, the far right rejects the very idea of neutral, binding arbiters; there is only Us and Them, only a zero-sum contest for resources. That mindset leads to what I call “tribal epistemology” — the systematic conflation of what is true with what is good for the tribe. There’s always been a conspiratorial and xenophobic fringe on the right, but it was (fitfully) held in place by gatekeepers through the early decades of America’s post-war prosperity. The explosion of right-wing media in the 1990s and 2000s swept those gatekeepers away, giving the loudest voice, the most exposure, and the most power to the most extreme elements on the right. The right-wing media ecosystem became a bubble from which fewer and fewer inhabitants ever ventured. As <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>massive</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>post-election</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>study</span></span><span class='card-underline'> of</span> online <span class='card-underline'>media </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>from </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Harvard</span></span> (which got far too little attention) <span class='card-underline'>showed</span>, media is not symmetrical any more than broader polarization is. “Prominent media on the left are well distributed across the center, center-left, and left,” the researchers found. “<span class='card-underline'>On the right, prominent media are highly partisan.”</span><span class='card-underline'> </span>When mapping out sources of online news, researchers found that the two basic poles were the center-left and the far-right. The center of gravity of the overall landscape is the center-left. Partisan media sources on the left are integrated into this landscape and are of lesser importance than the major media outlets of the center-left. The center of attention and influence for conservative media is on the far right. The center-right is of minor importance and is the least represented portion of the media spectrum. In short, <span class='card-underline'>they </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>conclude, “conservative media is</span></span><span class='card-underline'> more partisan and </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>more insular</span></span> than the left.” That insular partisan far-right media is also full of nonsense like Pizzagate that leaves the base continuously pumped up — outraged, infuriated, terrified, and misled. At this point, as the stories above show, the conservative base will believe anything. And they are pissed about all of it. As Brian Beutler wrote in a scathing piece recently, the mainstream media has never learned to deal with the right-wing bubble — it has not learned how not to take bad-faith lies seriously. And now we will all reap the consequences. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The incentives facing GOP politicians are not good</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>For Mueller’s findings to have any effect, they will have to break</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>some part of</span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the basic dynamic on the right</span></span>. Here’s how it works: Pundits and yellers in right-wing media compete to freak out the base and reinforce its allegiance to Donald Trump. <span class='card-underline'>The base leans on politicians</span>. And <span class='card-underline'>most </span><span class='card-underline'>elected GOP</span><span class='card-underline'> officials</span> are in seats safe enough that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>they fear a primary challenge</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>from the base more than a Democratic</span></span><span class='card-underline'> challenger</span>. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The only way to stave off a primary is to pay obeisance</span></span>. That’s why Jeff Flake and Bob Corker are leaving the Senate. They no longer have any control over what their constituents believe or want, and their constituents believe and want increasingly ugly things. Sen. John McCain is saying all the right things now, but back when he faced his own Tea Party challenger, he sprinted right as fast as he could. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>GOP politicians</span></span> cannot (or <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>feel</span></span> that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>they cannot</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>)</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> cross the base</span></span>. And the base is currently being lied to about the Mueller investigation at a furious pace. The entire right-wing machine has kicked into high gear, led by the president himself, furiously throwing out chaff about Comey, Mueller, Obama, Hillary, the dossier, the uranium, the emails, and whatever else. On Monday, Fox News practically had a blackout of the Mueller news. Instead it covered fake Clinton scandals and cheeseburger emojis. It was such an embarrassing performance that multiple people on the news side leaked their disappointment to reporter Oliver Darcy. As always, the goal of this media/political offensive (there is no longer much distinction) is less to present some coherent alternative account of the facts than to fill the atmosphere with fog, to give those on the right enough cover to slough off the charges as yet another liberal plot. (See Vox’s Sean Illing’s great interview with Charlie Sykes, the conservative talk-radio host who criticized Trump and was excommunicated, for more on how this happens.) This reaction to Mueller in right-wing media was predictable enough. Similar things have happened so many times before, and been studied, analyzed, and documented. But to this day, no one knows how to stop or counter it. Mainstream institutions seem as unable as ever to resist its warping effects. It’s all playing out like some morbid script that we can only watch, stupefied. As familiar as this dynamic is, however, this episode is different. <span class='card-underline'>We are drifting perilously close to a serious constitutional crisis.</span><span class='card-underline'> </span>What if we find out Trump is guilty and just can’t do anything about it? As long as the base is convinced that Mueller is an agent of the deep state (or whatever), it will punish any Republican politician that strays from the pack and criticizes Trump. For a GOP officeholder, standing up for democratic integrity could mean sacrificing reelection in 2018 or 2020. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>As long as</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> Republican</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>politician</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>s</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>are frightened by the base</span></span>, the base is frightened by scary conspiracies in right-wing media, and right-wing media makes more money the more frightened everyone is, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Trump appears to be safe</span></span>. As long as the incentives are aligned in that direction, there will be no substantial movement to censure, restrain, or remove him from office. What happens if nothing happens? Mainstream scholars do not think that Trump will be able to get away with simply ignoring Mueller’s findings or pardoning everyone involved. As Andy Wright, a law professor at Savannah Law School, put it, “with each abnormal, unbecoming, or dishonorable act, President Trump makes it harder for his appointees to defend him, harder for traditional Republicans to maintain their uneasy power alliance with him, and easier for Democrats to take the moral high ground and secure political advantage." But if there’s one thing non-experts like me have learned over the last few decades of watching US politics, it’s that experts are frequently caught flat-footed by the growing intensity of partisanship and the destruction of norms it has wrought. They are operating based on certain assumptions that it simply doesn’t occur to them that a politician can ignore. But politicians can. Mitch McConnell can simply refuse to hold a vote on a Supreme Court nominee. There’s no explicit rule or law that says he can’t, so he can, and he did. That one shocked and flabbergasted experts too, but just like all the other perverse steps down this road to illiberal lawlessness, they eventually took it on board and normalized it. Now they’re sure Donald Trump can’t simply brazen his way out of an indictment. What if they’re wrong about that? Say he pardons everyone. People will argue on cable TV about whether he should have. One side will say up, the other will say down. Trump may have done this, but what about when Obama did that? What about Hillary’s emails? Whatabout this, whatabout that, whatabout whatabout whatabout? There is no longer any settling such arguments. The only way to settle any argument is for both sides to be committed, at least to some degree, to shared standards of evidence and accuracy, and to place a measure of shared trust in institutions meant to vouchsafe evidence and accuracy. Without that basic agreement, without common arbiters, there can be no end to dispute. If one side rejects the epistemic authority of society’s core institutions and practices, there’s just nothing left to be done. Truth cannot speak for itself, like the voice of God from above. It can only speak through human institutions and practices. The subject of climate change offers a crystalline example here. If climate science does its thing, checks and rechecks its work, and then the Republican Party simply refuses to accept it ... what then? That’s what US elites are truly afraid to confront: What if facts and persuasion just don’t matter anymore? As long as conservatives can do something — steal an election, gerrymander crazy districts to maximize GOP advantage, use the filibuster as a routine tool of opposition, launch congressional investigations as political attacks, hold the debt ceiling hostage, repress voting among minorities, withhold a confirmation vote on a Supreme Court nominee, defend a known fraud and sexual predator who has likely colluded with a foreign government to gain the presidency — they will do it, knowing they’ll be backed by a relentlessly on-message media apparatus. And if that’s true, if the very preconditions of science and journalism as commonly understood have been eroded, then all that’s left is a raw contest of power. Donald Trump has the power to hold on to the presidency, as long as elected Republicans, cowed by the conservative base, support him. That is true almost regardless of what he’s done or what’s proven by Mueller. As long as he has that power, he will exercise it. That’s what recent history seems to show. <span class='card-underline'>Dem</span>ocrat<span class='card-underline'>s</span> <span class='card-underline'>do not</span> currently <span class='card-underline'>have the numbers to stop him.

As the battle over that new political order is enacted on the national stage, we have all become the dragooned antagonists in the play. This is what it is to live in the realm of the Big Man: his drama perforce is ours. <span class='card-underline'>Relentless political struggle, permanent revolution, shattering of norms, scandal and controversy, the capital hip-deep in broken crockery: this is what his supporters signed on for and this is what he is determined to give them; perhaps he knows how to give them little else</span>. <span class='card-underline'>To him </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>they are everything, his base</span></span><span class='card-underline'>: “This is a beautiful movement!”</span> “They’ve never seen a movement like this in our country before.” <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>They are his</span></span> creation, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>permanent suppliers of the adulation and self-affirmation he craves</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span>2 <span class='card-underline'>Now they cheer and hoot</span> and scoff while their hero, saber in hand, slashes and hacks at his enemies among the hated status quo. The latter include not just Stephen Bannon’s “handful of media elites” but many others who are appalled and outraged and find themselves forced to live under the pall of permanent political anxiety that hangs over the nation’s cities. It is our outrage, our disgust, our knee-jerk shock and condemnation that animate the play and give verisimilitude to the battle being fought. We are the enemy and our screams of dismay are vital to the drama. Behind the controversies about crowd size and alternative facts and illegal voters and Muslim bans, all the shock and alarm and political fatigue can be reduced to a dawning horrified recognition that <span class='card-underline'>President Trump is indeed…Donald Trump. His uttering a thirty-five-word oath</span> of office <span class='card-underline'>did not magically make him into someone else; he is determined to change the office much more than the office could ever change him</span>. How could anyone have doubted that President Trump would be Donald Trump plus great power and not Donald Trump plus great restraint? <span class='card-underline'>And</span> that he would be<span class='card-underline'> determined to use that newfound power to begin to do pretty much what he told his base he was going to do</span>? And—a final irony—that his very determination to break crockery and spread chaos and disruption is a major obstacle standing between him and the “new political order” whose birth his Svengali Bannon claims he will oversee. The necessity for continual disruption, constant outrage, maintaining an iron grip on the news cycle, and sheer winning without ever retreating means he has a grand proclivity for getting in his own way—“stepping on his own dick,” in political parlance—and we need, not for the first time, to let ourselves be grateful for that. It has thus far proved to be the hated status quo’s most important protection—not least because in very short order he has managed to produce a growing cadre of adversaries within the government itself. Most important, Trump’s aggressive and reckless sallies against intelligence professionals have secured him powerful enemies within the national security apparatus, who have increasingly been making use of their contacts in the elite press—particularly The Washington Post and The New York Times—to fight back and undermine his new administration. This is an important part of the so-called Russia scandal: that the “intelligence services,” in the words of Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, “seem to be at war” with the new president.3 That war has already claimed a high-level casualty in the person of General (retired) Michael Flynn, the president’s first national security adviser, who was fired after only twenty-four days in the job. Though Trump has railed against “illegal leaks” and declared that Flynn “was treated very unfairly by the media,” this side of the story—the bureaucratic war being waged against Trump from within the government—by its nature cannot be adequately told in the press itself, because reporters, however much they resist acknowledging it, in effect are vital players. This storyline is obscured, one might say, by the storytellers’ own shadows. Four weeks of the Trump ascendancy have been an ongoing seminar on where norms end and laws begin, on how much of what we had relied on when it came to the president’s conduct rested largely on a heretofore unquestioned foundation of centuries-old custom. That the president would express respect for the prerogatives of Congress and the judiciary, that he would acknowledge the country’s need for an independent press, that he would generally tell the truth and hold in respect the public record: in little more than the time it took to recite the oath of office much of this has been swept away. Donald Trump is a proud shatterer of these norms, and the louder the crash and splatter the better: for to his supporters such norms are nostrums, antiquated excuses for the elite’s own self-protection, and the wails of outrage and protest mean their hero is doing what they sent him to Washington to do. The norms are gone, perhaps never to be fully restored, and we have advanced now to the laws. The dividing line is surprisingly murky. That the president would not use his office to promote his personal business, for example, depends not only on the so-called emoluments clause of the Constitution but a good many subsidiary norms that Trump began shattering some time ago, when he refused to release his tax returns during the campaign. (His long-standing vow to release them once an audit was completed has been quietly abandoned.4) It seems plain now that in the near term the emoluments clause has in common with these norms that it requires political animation: that it has life only to the degree that those in power are willing to enliven it. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Thus far Republicans</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>in Congress, still stunned to find themselves enjoying an undreamed-of monopoly on power and struggling to craft a workable political program not based solely on ressentiment,<span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>have shown themselves </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>uninterested</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> in pressing Trump</span></span><span class='card-underline'> on his business entanglements and seem willing to stand by and let the presidency become a source of great wealth for the Trump family</span>. Thus do sacred cows perish, not with a bellow but with a whimper. Ours is famously said to be a government of laws, not of men, and yet we find in the Age of Trump that the laws depend on men and women willing to step forward and press them and that such are not to be found in the dominant party in Congress. Republicans are too divided and too focused on the main chance to move to protect what suddenly appear to be abstract principles. In an age when their party cannot muster a national popular vote majority they find themselves unaccountably in full possession of two branches of government and face the task of mastering their divisions sufficiently to pass a political program that won’t further doom them to the wilderness. This means adopting policies of opposition designed to cultivate and harvest resentment, such as repealing Obamacare, which provides health insurance to more than twenty million Americans, while somehow shaping them into a positive program that they can present to constituents as having improved their lives. It is a daunting task and thus far they show few signs of being up to it. Untroubled by norms, President Trump required only two weeks to come face-to-face with laws in the form not of Congress but of three judges of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Once again banning Muslims was what he had promised his base he would do. That the executive order itself was a legal mess in its drafting and in its execution stemmed both from the modus operandi that the <span class='card-underline'>Trump</span> team has adopted—policies closely held, drafts jealously sheltered from the eyes of those even in the departments or agencies responsible for carrying them out (taking a page from Dick Cheney’s post–September 11 playbook)—and perhaps from the desire of the president and his advisers to stage a fight with a major institutional force not yet recumbent before him: the judiciary. Thus the president’s assertion of his “unreviewable” powers in the face of “so-called” judges was not just absurd or ignorant but a bit of bait, establishing the basis for blaming the judiciary for any terrorist attack that was to come. On this he tweeted indefatigably and repeatedly: “Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril,” he said in his most explicit tweet. “If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!” Then: “I have instructed Homeland Security to check people coming into our country VERY CAREFULLY. The courts are making the job very difficult!” “People,” of course, are not “pouring in,” certainly not from the seven countries targeted. But the phrase <span class='card-underline'>links</span> once again <span class='card-underline'>the country’s vital security to the complex of issues at the heart of Trump’s “America First” politics: trade, immigration, and terrorism. Fortress America is being assailed by</span> foreigners who pour into the country and take our jobs, by <span class='card-underline'>elite technocrats</span> (“stupid people”) <span class='card-underline'>who negotiate trade deals that leave our borders unprotected, by traitorous businessmen who move factories abroad</span>, and by terrorists who take advantage of the nonexistent immigration safeguards to penetrate our shores. Everywhere the Other threatens. Everywhere the stupid, ineffectual, corrupt, self-dealing elites do nothing to protect the Forgotten American, in effect allying themselves with the threatening outsiders, becoming, in reality if not intent, traitors. As Trump proclaimed from the Capitol scarcely a month ago, “this stops, right here and right now.” But now “so-called judges” stand in the president’s way. The president will likely get his immigration ban, in one form or another, by backing up, rewriting the executive order, and proclaiming victory. Commentators will bemoan the fiasco that his first immigration rollout became. But Trump will have established the precedent of saddling the judiciary with responsibility for the next attack. Jack Goldsmith, the former head of the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel under George W. Bush and now a professor at Harvard Law School, notes that “Trump is setting the scene to blame judges after an attack that has any conceivable connection to immigration.” He goes on: If Trump loses in court he credibly will say to the American people that he tried and failed to create tighter immigration controls. This will deflect blame for the attack. And it will also help Trump to enhance his power after the attack. After a bad terrorist attack at home, politicians are always under intense pressure to loosen legal constraints. (This was even true for near-misses, such as the failed Underwear bomber, which caused the Obama administration to loosen constraints on its counterterrorism policies in many ways.) Courts feel these pressures, and those pressures will be significantly heightened, and any countervailing tendency to guard against executive overreaction diminished, if courts are widely seen to be responsible for an actual terrorist attack. More broadly, the usual security panic after a bad attack will be enhanced quite a lot—in courts and in Congress—if before the attack legal and judicial constraints are seen to block safety. If Trump assumes that there will be a bad terrorist attack on his watch, blaming judges now will deflect blame and enhance his power more than usual after the next attack.5 One might add that Trump’s executive order and the presidential Twitter assault on the judiciary that followed have set up the judiciary to be blamed following any attack, not just one having “any conceivable connection to immigration.” In his followers’ view Trump has acted to protect the country and “political” judges have blocked him. He has put them in a position to take the fall. Perhaps this was not the original plan but with Trump, it is safe to say, there will likely never be an original plan that plays out to the end. As the hapless Jeb Bush observed, Trump was “a chaos candidate and he’d be a chaos president.” Better to say that Trump uses chaos as a vital element in his tactics, perhaps having learned during his long career to capitalize on the chaos that his recklessness, ignorance, and aggression inevitably create. <span class='card-underline'>One might call the</span> resulting <span class='card-underline'>tactics “</span><span class='card-underline'>shock and opportunity”: Trump uses chaos to shock his opponents into varying crouches of outrage and contempt and then lunges forward amid the tumult wherever he sees an opportunity</span><span class='card-underline'> presenting itself.</span> No wonder he thinks of himself as the supreme “counter-puncher.” His virtuosity is in his opportunism. <span class='card-underline'>It is against this reality that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>we must see </span></span><span class='card-underline'>the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>likelihood of a crisis as the </span></span><span class='card-underline'>vital </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>springboard of a Trump presidency, </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>especially an increasingly shaky, unpopular, and unstable one</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The lower his poll numbers</span></span>, the more outlandish his lies, the greater the resistance from opponents within the bureaucracies, the thicker his scandals and chaos, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the likelier he will be to seek to use a crisis</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and all the opportunities it offers to lever himself from a position of defensiveness to that of dominating power</span>.

There is no way of predicting, but <span class='card-underline'>it </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is worth taking very seriously</span></span><span class='card-underline'> that some sort of crisis will come</span> and that, given Trump’s past behavior, his ruthless opportunism, and his drumbeat emphasis on “protecting the country,” such a crisis might well serve as a turning point in a Trump presidency, particularly one that is increasingly under siege. Consider the possibility of a terrorist attack on American soil, even a failed one. Not only would such an attack, as noted, put Trump in a perfect position to strike out at the judiciary, a major countervailing institution, it would offer him the political leverage to put down various rebellions within the bureaucracy, particularly within the intelligence agencies. There is no way to know whether such an attack will come but one can say that Trump, by attempting to strike out at Muslims generally, as he had vowed to do, has managed to place the Islamic State in the tempting position of being able to affirm, by attacking the United States, that it is the avenger of all Muslims. No accident that its propagandists have been nothing short of exultant, dubbing Trump’s executive order “the blessed order” and thus raising it to the level of the United States’ “blessed invasion” of Iraq as a miracle savior of its cause. If, as the Islamic State has asserted, the goal of its attacks in the West has been to “eliminate the gray zone”—to place “Muslims in the West…between one of two choices,” to either “apostatize or [migrate] to the Islamic State, and thereby escape persecution from the Crusader government and citizens”6—then Trump’s immigration ban goes far toward accomplishing the same thing: isolating Islamic communities, placing them all among a besieged minority whose travel is restricted and whose loyalty to their adopted countries is put in question. Already several jihadist tweeters asserted that the prophecy of the late Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born cleric killed in a drone attack in Yemen in 2011, that the “West would eventually turn against its Muslim citizens,” had been fulfilled.7 If one sought to design a policy to encourage radicalization, it would be hard to suggest a better one. One needn’t posit an administration master plan to notice that a further attack, even an unsuccessful one, will find the political ground well prepared. The panic over security that follows will open the way to a variety of measures to “protect the country,” few or none of which might have been necessary to prevent the attack in the first place. As we have seen, after an attack politicians seize the opportunity to act, not least to deflect blame from themselves, and we can expect President Donald (“The hour of action has arrived!”) Trump, after his repeated vows to keep the country safe, to act aggressively and comprehensively. How far he might go would depend on the severity of an attack, the ambitions of the administration, and perhaps how cornered the president feels himself to be. What measures might we expect under a Trump state of emergency? Probably strong steps against refugees, aliens, and immigrants. Suspending all entry of refugees. Widespread deportations. Expelling many green card holders. Further tightening and even suspending immigration. Mosques might be placed under surveillance, the much-discussed Muslim registry established. More broadly, and again depending on the severity of an attack, bulk collection of metadata might be reinstituted along with other forms of domestic surveillance. Long-standing constraints on the military and the CIA operating domestically might be loosened or eliminated. Black sites would be reestablished and torture reintroduced. The cells at Guantánamo, nearly empty now, would once again begin to fill. The standing post–September 11 Authorization for the Use of Military Force might be expanded or replaced, allowing unlimited military strikes abroad—and, perhaps, at home. The latter might lead, in the case of a particularly severe attack, to the suspension of habeas corpus. Certainly if such an attack were to come during the current Congress there is no reason to expect anything other than majority cooperation and support, not only for Trump’s specific responses to the attack but for the rest of his program. Democrats, whom Trump would denounce as worse than judges in their obstructionism, would be on the defensive. And the courts, whose pushback in any case would take much longer—as it did after September 11—will have been politically hamstrung by a commander in chief who will be in a position to declare, and to repeat, that he had warned the “political judges” not to second-guess him in what was needed to protect the country but that they had not listened. He will not be shy in saying the same about the press, “the most dishonest human beings on earth.” By then his political drama will have been elevated from a battle against elites and the status quo to a heroic struggle for the survival of the nation. As the hero was fond of telling his crowds during the campaign: if he lost, “we won’t even have a country anymore.” There is little reason to suspect they don’t believe it still and no reason to think he does not. “Never let a crisis go to waste,” President Obama’s first chief of staff was fond of saying. It is fair to expect that, in the face of opportunities to increase his power, destroy the opposition, and build his “new political order,” President Trump will once again gaze upon the darkening skies and see only sunshine.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>US-China nuclear war causes extinction</div><div class='cite'>Wittner 12 [Lawrence, PhD, Professor of History emeritus at the State University of New York/Albany, has written extensively about nuclear war, “Is a Nuclear War With China Possible?”, first published on 11/30/11 and updated on 1/30/12, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lawrence-wittner/nuclear-war-china_b_1116556.html]</div><div class='card-body'><p>But what would that “victory” entail? <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>An attack with</span></span> these <span class='card-underline'>Chinese </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>nuclear weapons would </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>immediately slaughter</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> at least 10 million</span></span><span class='card-underline'> Americans </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>in a </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>great storm of blast and fire</span></span>, while <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>leaving many more </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>dying horribly of sickness and radiation poisoning.</span></span><span class='card-underline'> The Chinese death toll in a nuclear war would be </span><span class='card-underline'>far higher</span><span class='card-underline'>. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Both nations would be reduced to </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>smoldering, radioactive wastelands</span></span>.

But how do embattled leaders stand to gain from initiating such risky conflicts? Do diversionary incentives derive from an attempt to rally the people behind the regime, or from leaders taking risky gambles to demonstrate their competence to the population? The literature to date has specified several causal pathways through which domestic unrest pushes leaders to initiate conflict abroad. Yet these competing theories of what I call “diversionary incentives” remain largely untested. We remain unsure of whether diversionary conflict, to the extent it occurs at all, is driven by unpopular leaders attempting to prove their competence to coalition members, stir up nationalist sentiment at home, scapegoat foreign groups for domestic problems, or simply distract constituents from the government’s failings. Although scholars have posited numerous mechanisms potentially underlying diversion, recent work has largely centered on the “rally around the flag” and “gambling for resurrection” theories as the most plausible explanations of diversionary conflict. Rally around the flag theory derives from the social psychology literature and argues that the cohesion of an “in-group” increases during crises or conflicts against a widely recognized “out-group.” <span class='card-underline'>The gambling for resurrection logic argues that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>embattled leaders can</span></span><span class='card-underline'> rationally </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>initiate risky conflicts</span></span><span class='card-underline'> in a </span><span class='card-underline'>last ditch</span><span class='card-underline'> effort </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>to</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>demonstrate competence</span></span><span class='card-underline'> to the public</span>. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Recent studies</span></span> <span class='card-underline'>have </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>made significant advancements in specifying the</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>conditions under which diversion is likely to occur</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and the types of conflicts likely to be initiated</span> (Smith 1996; Gelpi 1997; Clark 2003; Mitchell and Prins 2004; Fordham 2005; Mitchell and Thyne 2010; Tir 2010). Little empirical work has been done, however, to adjudicate among the competing logics of how and why domestic unrest generates incentives for international conflict. This paper addresses this gap, assessing the various mechanisms thought to generate diversionary incentives for embattled leaders. I argue that we can gain significant leverage on the question of diversionary incentives by examining the types of states that are targeted in diversionary conflict. The rally and gambling theories posit entirely distinct logics behind the diversionary use of force, with immediate implications for the type of target chosen. Specifically, the rally theory predicts that diverting leaders will target traditional enemies and enduring rivals, as conflict against such persistent adversaries is most likely to promote in-group solidarity. <span class='card-underline'>According to the gambling logic,</span> conversely, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>leaders</span></span><span class='card-underline'> are essentially agents that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>must</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>demonstrate competence </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>to their poorly-informed principals</span></span>, <span class='card-underline'>the </span><span class='card-underline'>general public</span><span class='card-underline'> or winning coalition</span> (Bueno de Mesquita and Siverson 1995; Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2003). <span class='card-underline'>In order for</span><span class='card-underline'> an international conflict to demonstrate competence to these principals, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the target </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>must be</span></span><span class='card-underline'> adequately </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>powerful</span></span> (Tarar 2006). Defeating a weak adversary simply does not demonstrate a leader’s competence. Essentially, <span class='card-underline'>the rally around the flag and gambling for resurrection theories yield starkly different hypotheses regarding the likely targets of diversionary conflict</span>. Testing these competing hypotheses can help us understand the nature of diversionary incentives and the domestic origins of international conflict. The extant literature has largely relied, implicitly or explicitly, on the rally around the flag logic in explaining diversionary conflict. A <span class='card-underline'>systematic examination</span> of diversionary targets, however, <span class='card-underline'>indicates that the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>gambling for resurrection</span></span><span class='card-underline'> logic </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>may offer </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>a stronger explanation</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>of diversionary incentives. Diversionary conflicts do not disproportionately target a state’s traditional adversaries. But <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>diversionary incentives</span></span><span class='card-underline'> do </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>appear to induce conflict with powerful targets</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. </span>These findings should lead us to re-examine the field’s implicit reliance upon psychological rally mechanisms in explaining diversionary conflict.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Disproven by his first year in office – he’s unilaterally done a bunch of crazy stuff that people said advisors would check

He let the Republican Establishment dictate his legislative agenda and most of his Cabinet, and allowed the putative “adults” in the West Wing to overrule his instincts on the Iran deal, trade policy, and a variety of other matters. Of course, this forbearance was never strong enough to prevent the man from firing off incendiary tweets, praising white nationalists, canceling climate deals, or obstructing a little justice.

According to a Washington Post account shortly after Nixon’s resignation, Schlesinger and the Joint Chiefs “kept a close watch to make certain that no orders were given to military units outside the normal chain of command.” The Post attributed the move to <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>concern</span></span> that <span class='card-underline'>Nixon might</span> try to <span class='card-underline'>use the military to stage some sort of coup to avert impeachment</span>. But in its 2014 obituary of Schlesinger, the New York Times reported an even more chilling concern: that <span class='card-underline'>in his disintegrating mental state</span>, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Nixon might</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>order the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>use</span></span><span class='card-underline'> of </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>nuclear weapons</span></span>. If Schlesinger did indeed give this order—and over the remaining 40 years of his life, he artfully and consistently avoided denying it—it was unconstitutional. As Franklin C. Miller, who served for three decades in U.S. national security roles, told the New York Times in 2016, “<span class='card-underline'>The president and </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>only the president has</span></span><span class='card-underline'> the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>authority to</span></span><span class='card-underline'> order the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>use</span></span><span class='card-underline'> of </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>nuc</span></span><span class='card-underline'>lear weapon</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>s</span></span>.” But <span class='card-underline'>can the President alone order a first use of nuclear weapons, and</span> for that matter, <span class='card-underline'>a preventive war of choice?</span> Since Donald Trump became a serious candidate for President, this legal, constitutional and moral conundrum and the memory of Schlesinger’s principled act of defiance have heavily shaped discussion of how he would handle the awesome powers of the presidency over national security. Donald <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Trump’s presidency enters</span></span><span class='card-underline'> its second year with the</span> palpable <span class='card-underline'>sense of </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>a gathering storm</span></span>. By most accounts, the investigation by special counsel Robert <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Mueller is pushing</span></span><span class='card-underline'> forward aggressively</span> on multiple fronts. It may now be getting close to the President’s family and his most inner circle, after already indicting his former campaign chairman and obtaining plea agreements with his national security advisor and a lower-level foreign policy aide. Reportedly, Mueller is seeking to interview Trump directly. <span class='card-underline'>In the courts of public opinion</span> and elementary common sense (and possibly down the line, in legal proceedings as well), <span class='card-underline'>the President appears to be his own worst enemy</span>. Who that is innocent of political collusion with the Russians repeats 16 times in an impromptu 30-minute interview, “there was no collusion”? The words have become such a relentless Trump mantra, day after day, week after week, like a nervous tick, that they inevitably summon Shakespeare’s trenchant insight from Hamlet, “The lady doth protest too much.” The persistent and by now gratuitous denials come from a President who is unable or unwilling to distinguish truth from fiction, who dishes out falsehoods as a daily ritual, whose gluttony and compulsive behavior suggest (in the words of a psychiatrist I respect) “a complete lack of impulse control,” and who, by the shocking account of Michael Wolff’s new book, Fire and Fury, as well as many others, doesn’t read memos, can hardly be briefed, is overwhelmed by an office he was not expecting to win, and is losing what grasp he had of reason and reality. In short, we may be approaching in the second year of the 45th president a situation as volatile and dangerous as the final days of the 37th president. For all his legendary faults—his greed for power, his paranoia, his bitterness and vindictiveness—<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Nixon</span></span> was <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>at least</span></span> a deeply experienced and knowledgeable president, both in domestic and foreign affairs, and he <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>understood the</span></span> awesome <span class='card-underline'>destructive </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>power of nuc</span></span><span class='card-underline'>lear weapon</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>s. Trump is</span></span><span class='card-underline'> completely </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>lacking</span></span><span class='card-underline'> in governing or </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>military experience</span></span> of any kind. Most frighteningly, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>he may not</span></span><span class='card-underline'> actually </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>understand</span></span><span class='card-underline'> how devastating a </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>nuclear war</span></span><span class='card-underline'> could be</span>, or even a conventional war on the Korean peninsula. And he may have learned the wrong lesson from his (to my view well justified) April 2017 launch of 59 cruise missiles to punish the Syrian regime for its use of chemical weapons. That brought no serious military retaliation against the United States. An attack on North Korea would involve very different stakes on both sides. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>As 2018 unfolds</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>domestic and international dimensions of Trump’s</span></span><span class='card-underline'> crisis-ridden </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>presidency are beginning to intersect</span></span> in wildly unpredictable and potentially disastrous ways. There are signs of preparations for a U.S. military attack on North Korea by mid-year, and a new report by a leading Russian expert on North Korea indicates that the Pyongyang regime “is convinced that the U.S. is preparing to strike.” This would likely be not a full-scale military assault to terminate the North Korea’s tyrannical regime but rather a punishing “bloody nose” strike, either to send a message about American resolve to halt further testing and development of Kim Jong Un’s nuclear weapons program or to actually destroy as much of its existing infrastructure as possible. While every American would like to be rid of the nuclear threat from the world’s last totalitarian regime, the risks of a military strike are enormous. They involve not only the possibility of massive North Korean retaliation against South Korea (and against American military installations in South Korea and Japan, where a total of more than 50,000 American troops are based), but also a military confrontation with China, which is ramping up its own military preparations in response to the growing signs of the U.S. military planning for an assault. Moreover, the attack would likely be seen by most of the world as an unprovoked act of “preventive war,” and one that would be launched before diplomatic options had clearly been exhausted (as they have hardly yet been adequately pursued). This would leave the U.S. diplomatically isolated and viewed by most of the world as responsible for death and destruction on a massive level. A diplomatic breakthrough to freeze and contain North Korea’s program before it can hit the U.S. may still be possible, and Trump is now all of a sudden signaling openness to diplomacy. But it is hard to see this as anything more than the president’s notorious unpredictability. As the Wall Street Journal observed in reporting his new signal, “Mr. Trump has vacillated between seeming open to—and even eager for—diplomacy with North Korea, and dismissing the need or value for it.” Then there is the looming domestic political crisis. What signal was the President sending when he told the New York Times in December, “I have absolute right to do what I want to do with the Justice Department”? And what are we to make of the gathering drumbeat of demands from conservative media figures, Trump loyalists, and Republican congressmen for Mueller’s firing—a seemingly orchestrated campaign that has congressional Democrats and even some Republicans deeply worried? <span class='card-underline'>In the coming months, the two gathering crises may</span> well <span class='card-underline'>intersect</span>. Given his past behavior and personal volatility, a Trump order to fire Mueller might be a shocking offense against the justice process, but it would hardly be surprising, considering his previous efforts to obstruct justice in the Russia investigation. These include his asking FBI director James Comey for a pledge of personal loyalty and then firing him when he did not receive it, and his attempt (in March of last year) to stop Attorney General Jeff Sessions from recusing himself from the Russia investigation. Then there was the widely reported incident aboard Air Force One last July 8, when the President reportedly personally dictated a statement his son was to issue insisting that Donald Trump Jr.’s meeting with a Russian lawyer the year before was “primarily” to discuss “a program about the adoption of Russian children,” and not the ongoing presidential campaign. Like the repeated condemnations of the special counsel’s investigations, the demands that it come to a close, and the endless recitation of the mantra, “there was no collusion,” these three episodes reek of the fear of a man who has something to hide, and who is laboring obsessively to hide it. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>We do not yet have proof</span></span> either <span class='card-underline'>of </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>what happened with Russia</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, or of how</span> Donald <span class='card-underline'>Trump will conduct himself</span> as this second year of his presidency unfolds. It has been a characteristic feature of <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>his instability</span></span> that his personal and political tirades alternate with tantalizing glimpses of a more practical, reasonable, and approachable man, ready to make serious compromises for a workable deal—whether on immigration, or infrastructure, or NAFTA, or who knows, even North Korea. But <span class='card-underline'>it is</span> also <span class='card-underline'>characteristic of individuals with personality disorders that the illness </span><span class='card-underline'>inevitably seeps through</span>—as in his latest racist outburst about black immigrants from “sh*thole countries.” <span class='card-underline'>And </span><span class='card-underline'>the malady </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>grows worse as</span></span><span class='card-underline'> the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>pressure intensifies</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.

Bush was the decider, <span class='card-underline'>consider</span> Donald <span class='card-underline'>Trump the un-decider</span>. This week, the current president <span class='card-underline'>abandoned a string of his best-known policy positions over a matter of days</span>. At a press conference with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: "The secretary general and I had a productive discussion about what more NATO can do in the fight against terrorism. I complained about that a long time ago and they made a change, and now they do fight terrorism. I said it was obsolete. It's no longer obsolete." (On March 22: "NATO, obsolete, because it doesn't cover terrorism" — a claim that is untrue.) On China, in a Wall Street Journal interview: "They're not currency manipulators." (On April 2: "You know, when you talk about, when you talk about currency manipulation, when you talk about devaluations, they are world champions.") On Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen, in that same Wall Street Journal interview: "No, not toast ... I like her, I respect her. It's very early." (On May 5, 2016: "She is not a Republican. ... When her time is up, I would most likely replace her because of the fact that I think it would be appropriate.") This is just a taste; <span class='card-underline'>NBC's First Read </span><span class='card-underline'>counted up</span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>13 flip-flops</span></span><span class='card-underline'> in the last few months</span>. <span class='card-underline'>It's certainly noteworthy that the president has undone so many positions in such a short time frame — Americans might reasonably want to know exactly what their leader believes. But what kind of </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>political consequences</span></span><span class='card-underline'> will he suffer? Potentially </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>very few</span></span><span class='card-underline'> — at least in the short term — </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>according to </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>political experts</span></span>. Here's why. <span class='card-underline'>1) Lots of his </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>supporters don't love him for specific policies, anyway</span></span>. In 2004, one massive flip-flop was a crippling blow to John Kerry's campaign (See: his comments on how he "actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it"). Last year, however, <span class='card-underline'>Trump </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>made flip</span></span><span class='card-underline'>-flop </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>after</span></span><span class='card-underline'> flip-</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>flop during the</span></span><span class='card-underline'> presidential </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>campaign</span></span><span class='card-underline'> — and he still won</span>. <span class='card-underline'>Policy flip-flops simply didn't seem to stick to him</span>. One reason may be that <span class='card-underline'>very specific policy proposals just aren't what people like about him</span>. "I think there probably is something to the idea that to a degree <span class='card-underline'>his appeal isn't policy-based," says Robert Van </span><span class='card-underline'>Houweling</span><span class='card-underline'>, a political science professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who has studied flip-flopping</span>. "One answer why <span class='card-underline'>he has more latitude</span> than some politicians is that <span class='card-underline'>his appeal was more visceral</span>." Because of that, it's quite possible that <span class='card-underline'>Trump's approval rating won't inch down much </span><span class='card-underline'>as a result of</span><span class='card-underline'> a half-dozen 180s</span>. "I've just been out going to a bunch of town halls this week, and I <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>don't see any evidence that it's hurting him at all</span></span><span class='card-underline'>," says Mark McKinnon, a longtime strategist who served George W. Bush</span>, among others. "And in fact, what I would say is for <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>opponents</span></span><span class='card-underline'> of Trump, they're </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>very happy to see him changing positions, and</span></span><span class='card-underline'> his </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>supporters don't</span></span><span class='card-underline'> really </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>care</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. It's remarkable</span>." Of course, it's true that there are a few key policies that Trump's voters did latch onto, like building a wall. But then, part of his "visceral" appeal came not just from the idea of building a wall (or proposing a "total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States" or imposing massive tariffs on China), but from his tough image in general. That toughness continues to win voters over. "When people vote for presidents, it's more for attributes than it is for issues," McKinnon adds. "And there's usually strength, trust, and you know, 'Does he reflect my values?' Those are the three big ones. And he's doing really well on strength right now" because of his recent actions in Syria — which also, by the way, constitute a flip-flop. Indeed, Republicans now overwhelmingly support missile strikes in Syria — a reversal from 2013, during the Obama presidency, when two-thirds said they did not. <span class='card-underline'>2) </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>He </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>doesn't have much support to lose</span></span>. Speaking of that <span class='card-underline'>approval rating</span>, it's <span class='card-underline'>already at near-historic-lows</span> for a new president. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Those who approve</span></span><span class='card-underline'> of him have </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>already stuck with him through a litany of flip-flops</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Those who disapprove</span></span><span class='card-underline'> — well, they </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>already disapprove</span></span>. With an approval rating of around 60 percent, a president likely has more people who aren't truly dedicated to them, Van Houweling says, "so you quickly see the effect of sort of damaging political moves in that context." That kind of signal may not show up when you have been riding at around 40 to 45 percent for a while, he says. "<span class='card-underline'>It's not easy to get a 10 percent decline in your popularity when you start out with really just your core supporters viewing your job being done well to begin with" — particularly</span>, he adds, <span class='card-underline'>if those supporters are already used to Trump's views on policy being easily changeable</span>. <span class='card-underline'>3) Some of these policies aren't exactly emotional issues for Americans</span>. Trump just did do more major policy about-faces in a few days than other presidents might take years to do. But not all of these flip-flops are terribly meaningful to most Americans. Consider monetary policy. In 2015, 70 percent of Americans didn't know who Janet Yellen was. So suddenly saying he might reappoint her as Federal Reserve chair might reasonably not bother many Americans all that much. Likewise, Trump said over and over and over that he'd label China a "currency manipulator." The average American has little reason to know exactly how currency manipulation works. One addendum here is that <span class='card-underline'>while Trump's policy message</span> on China <span class='card-underline'>has changed, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>his </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>tone</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> hasn't budged</span></span><span class='card-underline'> much</span>. He still proved on Twitter on Thursday morning that he's willing to talk tough on China: "I have great confidence that China will properly deal with North Korea. If they are unable to do so, the U.S., with its allies, will!" <span class='card-underline'>Trump does have some particularly strong policy views, but no </span><span class='card-underline'>particular ideology</span><span class='card-underline'> is so central to his identity as that tough-guy image. It may be that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>maintaining that</span></span><span class='card-underline'> image, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>as opposed to</span></span><span class='card-underline'> maintaining </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>particular policy</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> views</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, is what will </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>allow him to remain constant</span></span><span class='card-underline'> in voters' minds</span>. <span class='card-underline'>4) Some flip-flops </span><span class='card-underline'>can be seen as</span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>good flip-flops</span></span>. <span class='card-underline'>One upside</span> to the Trump China flip-flop: <span class='card-underline'>He flipped </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>in the direction of truth</span></span>. China really hasn't been manipulating its currency recently. (The Washington Post's Fact Checker in December called the currency manipulation claims "way out of date.") <span class='card-underline'>To the extent that Trump's flip-flops reflect changing circumstances — or him acknowledging current circumstances —flip-flops could be viewed positively</span>. "Conditions do change, and you have to change with them. I mean, that's part of the job," says Stephen Wayne, professor of government and an expert in the American presidency at Georgetown University.

If so, here's a different question. <span class='card-underline'>How can we insure</span> that <span class='card-underline'>the</span> new <span class='card-underline'>president </span><span class='card-underline'>feels he's getting his way often enough to keep him satisfied without creating disaster</span> on the actual policies? Answer: Think "Wag the Dog." In this version, <span class='card-underline'>p</span><span class='card-underline'>eople inside</span> and outside of <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>his administration will </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>persuade him to fight</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and win a few </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>harmless battles</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The Tweeter</span></span><span class='card-underline'>-in-Chief </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>can </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>say</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and believe </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>he's taking</span></span><span class='card-underline'> decisive </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>action</span></span>. And <span class='card-underline'>normal Republicans and Democrats can</span> get on with <span class='card-underline'>hash</span>ing <span class='card-underline'>out</span> the <span class='card-underline'>normal</span> stuff of <span class='card-underline'>politics</span>. Suggestion One: The president wins the war on crime! Solution: As president-elect, Trump is still saying the murder rate is "highest in 45 years," a fictional claim he made in the campaign as well. Despite a jump in 2015, the murder rate is close to historical lows. So all he has to do is start using real statistics instead of phony ones to claim credit for solving this one. The formula can be repeated for other mistaken claims he made during the campaign about how terrible America is. Suggestion Two: Repeal a fictional law! Solution: The president can help fulfill his "drain the swamp" pledge if he can claim a full defeat for everyone in Congress, including the Republican leadership. A harmless way to do this is to make up a law he can persuade Congress to "repeal." There's even a phony law that has already been invented, the Public Affairs Act of 1975, a title dreamed up by academics to study how public opinion works. It turns out that many people will readily express opinions on non-existent laws, and will support or oppose them in response to partisan cues. If congressional leaders deny the need to repeal the (fictional) law, perhaps Trump can get them to take action anyway, since it would placate the angry constituents who are calling the legislators' offices and demanding that the "law" be declared null and void. Done. Trump can go on a victory tour, and leave the battles over real policies to the people who are serious about the policies. Many voters don't know how law-making works in the U.S. in the first place, and others may not care much about the truth so much as they care about visibly sticking it to the do-nothing bureaucrats in Washington. Suggestion Three: Invade something! <span class='card-underline'>The president</span>-elect <span class='card-underline'>was the "</span><span class='card-underline'>bomb the hell out of them</span><span class='card-underline'>" candidate.</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> How can he</span></span><span class='card-underline'> do this </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>without involving</span></span> a lot of innocent people or harming the interests of the U.S., let alone pick the wrong place (<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>S</span></span><span class='card-underline'>outh </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>C</span></span><span class='card-underline'>hina </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>S</span></span><span class='card-underline'>ea</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>?</span></span>) <span class='card-underline'>and risk global war?</span> Solution: <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Find someplace out of the way</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, maybe an uninhabited island</span> somewhere in the South Pacific -- closer to Hawaii than to China and Japan. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Announce</span></span><span class='card-underline'> that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Islamic League is about to set up a base</span></span><span class='card-underline'> there</span>, <span class='card-underline'>and </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>then </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>bomb away</span></span> and even stage a beach landing, with patriotic flag-raising pictures. Yes, I'm joking (well, mostly). But <span class='card-underline'>these "solutions" show some </span><span class='card-underline'>serious truths</span><span class='card-underline'> about</span> how <span class='card-underline'>government</span> works. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Congress</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, career </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>civil servants</span></span>, interest groups and parties <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>manipulate all presidents</span></span>. The only question is how much, and how successful presidents are in fighting back. Even the most knowledgeable presidents have very limited expertise, given the vast number of subjects they deal with -- everything from space travel to Medicare reimbursement rates to aircraft carriers to national parks to constitutional law to regulation of complex financial products to disputes among Kurdish factions in Iraq. And the civil servants and members of Congress and lobbyists that presidents deal with are often masters of detail on whatever specific issue is under consideration. Presidents win a lot of these fights (or at least play to a draw) because they have strong political skills. They are good at figuring out what others want, and at knowing the incentives and motivations of those they must interact with. <span class='card-underline'>Trump</span> has to date not demonstrated such skills, although, to be fair, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>he's</span></span> only beginning to be tested. Thus far, he <span class='card-underline'>has shown a weakness for being</span> <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>easily distracted</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, and</span> of <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>seeking quick</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, surface-level </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>results</span></span> -- <span class='card-underline'>ones</span> that <span class='card-underline'>career </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>bureaucrats</span></span> or House subcommittee chairs <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>can </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>reverse</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>later</span>, once the president's attention has moved on to something else. Granted, a lot of people, even Republicans, would be reluctant to give Trump such a long leash to achieve phony victories. But <span class='card-underline'>if they fear he's dangerous</span> as president, then <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>it would be better to keep him happy with</span></span><span class='card-underline'> some </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>minor, temporary bump-ups in </span></span><span class='card-underline'>public </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>opinion</span></span><span class='card-underline'> than it is to let him </span><span class='card-underline'>intervene in areas where he could do real damage</span>. Of course, liberals believe that normal Republicans do plenty of damage to the nation on their own, Trump or no Trump. But at least those normal Republicans may respond to normal incentives, and moderate their positions if their ideal policies turn out to be unpopular.

A crisis may arise where there are real national-security rationales for fighting, along with potential domestic gains.

Some would say that the alliance is reluctant to take any serious decisions and is nothing more than a paper tiger. Nonetheless, the brainwashing of the last two years has significantly improved the decision-making capacity of NATO and the chances for achieving consensus over the “Russian threat.” The ability to mobilize quickly strong conventional forces is still low, as NATO generals admit themselves. However, active recent revival of the nuclear sharing arrangements and the <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>consolidation of U.S. troops</span></span><span class='card-underline'> in various countries of</span> Central and Eastern <span class='card-underline'>Europe </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>present </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>enough deterrence</span></span> against any light-minded action. It is clear that the war will not happen in Europe (and not even in Ukraine with its unpredictable leadership). However, wherever it occurs, NATO forces can eventually be mobilized to help their allies. <span class='card-underline'>Moreover, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Moscow has </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>largely</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> been pursuing a </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>defensive policy</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> over</span></span><span class='card-underline'> the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>past 16 years</span></span>. Even now, when “the Russians are (seemingly) coming,” an independent observer would probably notice that <span class='card-underline'>the lion’s share of the activities of Moscow are reactive rather than proactive</span>.

Iran might retaliate against U.S. troops or allies, launching missiles at military installations or civilian populations in the Gulf or perhaps even Europe. It could activate its proxies abroad, stirring sectarian tensions in Iraq, disrupting the Arab Spring, and ordering terrorist attacks against Israel and the United States. This could draw Israel or other states into the fighting and compel the United States to escalate the conflict in response. Powerful allies of Iran, including China and Russia, may attempt to economically and diplomatically isolate the United States. In the midst of such spiraling violence, neither side may see a clear path out of the battle, resulting in a long-lasting, devastating war, whose impact may critically damage the United States’ standing in the Muslim world. Those wary of a U.S. strike also point out that Iran could retaliate by attempting to close the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow access point to the Persian Gulf through which roughly 20 percent of the world’s oil supply travels. And even if Iran did not threaten the strait, speculators, fearing possible supply disruptions, would bid up the price of oil, possibly triggering a wider economic crisis at an already fragile moment. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>None of these outcomes is predetermined</span></span>, <span class='card-underline'>however; indeed, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the U</span></span><span class='card-underline'>nited </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>S</span></span><span class='card-underline'>tates </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>could</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>do much to </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>mitigate</span></span><span class='card-underline'> them</span>. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Tehran would</span></span><span class='card-underline'> certainly feel like it needed to respond to a U.S. attack</span>, in order to reestablish deterrence and save face domestically. <span class='card-underline'>But it would also likely seek to </span><span class='card-underline'>calibrate its actions to </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>avoid starting a conflict</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>that could </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>lead to the destruction of</span></span><span class='card-underline'> its military or </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the regime</span></span><span class='card-underline'> itself</span>. In all likelihood, the Iranian leadership would resort to its worst forms of retaliation, such as closing the Strait of Hormuz or launching missiles at southern Europe, only if it felt that its very existence was threatened. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>A </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>targeted U.S. operation</span></span><span class='card-underline'> need not threaten Tehran in such a fundamental</span> <span class='card-underline'>way</span>.

For example, the Science of Military Strategy concludes that “<span class='card-underline'>in the present and </span><span class='card-underline'>long-term future</span>, <span class='card-underline'>there is a </span><span class='card-underline'>miniscule</span> (shenwei) <span class='card-underline'>possibility</span> <span class='card-underline'>of an enemy initiating a large-scale ground invasion of China</span>.”125 Some Chinese <span class='card-underline'>analysts</span> also <span class='card-underline'>note</span> that U.S.-China <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>economic and political interdependence</span></span> would <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>further constrain</span></span><span class='card-underline'> the role of </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>nuclear weapons</span></span> <span class='card-underline'>in any future U.S.-China contingency</span>.126 As a result, <span class='card-underline'>the most likely</span> U.S.-China <span class='card-underline'>contingencies</span> in which nuclear weapons could play a role <span class='card-underline'>would involve Taiwan</span> or U.S. allies. In these conflicts, Chinese analysts believe that the stakes would not warrant the use of nuclear weapons by China (unless attacked first). They implicitly assume that the stakes would be too low for the United States, as well, and that Washington would either restrain or abandon its allies if defending them gave rise to a situation in which the United States would need to threaten to use nuclear weapons.127 The general view was that the United States would not want to become entangled in a conflict with China on behalf of its allies or other states. One interlocutor suggested that Taiwan and North Korea were the only third-party contingencies over which the United States and China would be willing to risk a nuclear crisis. Nevertheless, this interlocutor maintained that <span class='card-underline'>China would not use nuclear weapons against the Taiwanese people and that the Chinese government had distanced itself from</span> the <span class='card-underline'>remarks</span> of a senior PLA officer who commented in 2005 <span class='card-underline'>that China would use nuclear weapons if it were defeated in a conventional war over Taiwan</span>.128 Another interlocutor was concerned about the possible spillover effect of a U.S. preemptive strike on North Korea’s nuclear weapons. These Chinese views likely underestimate the strength of U.S. interests at stake in any conflict between a U.S. ally and China, as Christensen and Goldstein note. Although tensions have eased across the Taiwan Strait in recent years, the possibility of U.S. involvement in a conflict over Taiwan remains a real concern [End Page 35] for the PLA. The Science of Military Strategy acknowledges that cross-strait relations have improved, “but the key factors obstructing a solution to the Taiwan problem have not fundamentally disappeared.”129 As a result, the risk of a war over Taiwan’s unification is “relatively high.” The book states that such a war would be a relatively large-scale and relatively high-intensity conflict in which China would need to “guard against foreign military intervention” and that such a conflict would occur “against the background of nuclear deterrence.”130 <span class='card-underline'>Nevertheless, for the second reason below, most</span> interlocutors <span class='card-underline'>did not believe that China would threaten or use nuclear weapons without being threatened or attacked first.</span> <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>A second reason for</span></span><span class='card-underline'> a relatively optimistic view of crisis </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>stability is</span></span><span class='card-underline'> the Chinese view </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>that China’s limited ambiguity over its </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>n</span></span><span class='card-underline'>o-</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>f</span></span><span class='card-underline'>irst-</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>u</span></span><span class='card-underline'>se policy </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>remains consistent</span></span><span class='card-underline'> with a clear firebreak between the use of conventional and nuclear weapons</span>.

A recent textbook from AMS, for example, describes one of <span class='card-underline'>the</span> Second Artillery’s <span class='card-underline'>main missions as “preventing</span> (ezhi) <span class='card-underline'>an enemy from escalating</span> a conventional war to a nuclear war.”131 <span class='card-underline'>In the context of a Taiwan contingency</span>, Maj. Gen. Yao Yunzhu explains that “<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>it would be </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>useless</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> for China </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>to deter U.S. conventional intervention</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> by using</span></span><span class='card-underline'> China’s </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>nuclear weapons</span></span>. It is the United States, not China, which has the nuclear capabilities to control and even dominate conflict escalation.”132 Some Chinese interlocutors also claimed that U.S. conventional superiority contributes to a clear conventional-nuclear firebreak, as <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>U</span></span><span class='card-underline'>nited </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>S</span></span><span class='card-underline'>tates </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>would always have conventional options</span></span><span class='card-underline'> to escalate a conflict </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>and would</span></span><span class='card-underline'> therefore </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>not need to resort to nuclear threats or use</span></span>.133 <span class='card-underline'>Most</span> interlocutors <span class='card-underline'>expressed confidence that the</span> <span class='card-underline'>U</span>nited <span class='card-underline'>S</span>tates <span class='card-underline'>would have no reason to attack China’s nuclear arsenal</span> with conventional weapons, but some interlocutors recognized that nuclear escalation control was a part of U.S. war planning, despite the United States’ conventional superiority.134 If China views a conventional attack on its nuclear weapons or infrastructure as a first strike that [End Page 36] would justify nuclear retaliation, its belief about a clear firebreak rests more on a belief that the United States will be deterred from initiating such an attack than it does on a principled constraint. <span class='card-underline'>A third factor</span> in China’s optimistic assessment of crisis stability <span class='card-underline'>is</span> the <span class='card-underline'>perceived deterrent effectiveness of the limited ambiguity that China has allowed regarding its no-first-use policy</span>. Some strategists saw a greater temptation for the United States to attack China’s nuclear capabilities with conventional weapons as U.S. conventional precision strike capabilities improved. All inter-locutors indicated that China has carefully considered the possibility that the United States might use conventional force against China’s nuclear capabilities. As discussed earlier, <span class='card-underline'>China’s response has been to allow </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>limited ambiguity</span></span><span class='card-underline'> over its no-first-use posture to </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>deter such an attack</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> One interlocutor maintained that the United States did not believe that China would view an attack on China’s command and control facilities as an attack on its nuclear facilities and that China could do little to deter such an attack. Chinese strategists have noted that identifying what constitutes a nuclear command and control facility is challenging given the different levels of command and control.135 As a result, <span class='card-underline'>China is allowing the ambiguity surrounding its no-first-use policy in the hope that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>this will </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>undermine U.S. confidence</span></span><span class='card-underline'> that China would </span><span class='card-underline'>not escalate a conflict</span> if its nuclear capabilities were targeted.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>The aff is works within the academy, entrapped within the notion of “project” – it functions according to the will to productivity, that which subsumes resistance into the regularity of productive operations</div><div class='cite'>Winters 17 (Joseph Winters is an assistant professor of Religious Studies with a secondary position in the Department of African and African American Studies at Duke University, “Baldwin, Bataille, and the Anguish of the (Racialized) Human,” Journal of Religious Ethics, ///ghs-sc)</div><div class='card-body'><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Bataille</span></span>, more than Baldwin, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>troubles the very logic of futurity.

Rather, it is perhaps the way that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Bataille's writing actively contests systematic codes of academic inscription and takes </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>thought</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> to the limits of comprehension.</span></span> It is possible that this writing, which attempts to push understanding and empathy to a vertiginous summit, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>produces the reaction</span></span> that bypasses or exceeds intel lectual appraisal, leaping om reading to feeling <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>in a violent movement that manifests an extreme subjective and corporeal disturbance.</span></span> The idea of someone throwing up all over one of Bataille's texts is also quite nny, of course. Laughter is frequently a response to repugnance, or to the discomfort of others. As Bataille notes in the Preface to Madame Edwarda, 'laughter is the sign of aversion, of horror' (p. 224). But equally frequently, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>laughter is a defense mechanism, warding off the horror:</span></span> 'it is indeed in laughter that we nd the justi cation for a form of castigation, of obloquy' (p. 224). It is quite possible that, in their subjective extremity and their intense seriousness about uncomfortable topics, Bataille's own texts may be subject to laughter, particularly to the derisory mirth of a comfort able Anglo-American pragmatic or utilitarian scepticism. But this would be to miss completely the imponance of Bataille's thought - and Bataille's laughter: What the heany laugh screens us from, what fetches up the bawdy jest, is the identity that exists between the utmost in pleasure and the utmost in pain: the identity between being and non-being, between the living and the death-stricken being, between the knowledge which brings one before this dazzling realization and de nitive, concluding darkness . . . <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>our laughter here is absolute, going far beyond sco ing ridicule of something which may perhaps be repugnant</span></span>, but disgust for which digs deep under our skin . . . the sight of blood, the odour of vomit, which arouse in us the dread of death, sometimes introduce us into a nauseous state-which huns more cruelly than pain. (p. 225) That which is revolting, shocking, that which disarms predictable patte s of thinking and feeling, that which lies at the unhallowed extremes and unavowed interstices of social, philosophical or theoretical frameworks, are the objects of Bataille's fascination. Encounters with horror, violent disgust, that miraculously transform into experiences of laughter, intoxication, ec stasy, constitute, for Bataille, inner experiences that overwhelm any sense of the distinction between interiority or exteriority. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>At the limit of knowledge, un-knowing is activated, a process in which subjectivity is torn apart, unworked at the core of physical and mental being. Bataille's writing</span></span> strains to evoke such experiences, pushing language to its very limits, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>seeking the impossible in its re sal to remain contained within discourses predicated on sense, usefulness, responsibility, productiv</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>ity and positivity.</span></span> To feel violently ill at the encounter of such writing is perfectly natural in that the 'unnaturalness' of nature is disclosed as uncomfonable and horriing in its negativity: the homogeneous subject of culture retches in a movement of negation that never quite expends or transcends the force of heterogeneity in which she or he must imminently dissolve. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Reading exceeds the economy of ideas and meanings in which subject and addressee exchange sense and knowledge</span></span>; the gift of writing cannot be retu ed or contained in such a restricted fashion: what arrives is a contes tation of and challenge to modes of thinking, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>an expenditure of signification which consumes existing modes of commodification and exchange, laying waste to them in a waste l presentation of the waste that is their own.</span></span></p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Thus the alternative is a process of nonknowledge – an injection of non-meaning in the face of the 1AC.

The features of element 2 (</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>experientiality</span></span><span class='card-underline'>) </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>highlight its subjectivity and affectivity</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, its transgressive nature, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>and its</span></span><span class='card-underline'> seemingly </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>paradoxical property of leading both somewhere and nowhere.</span></span><span class='card-underline'> That nonknowledge has no authority other than itself is also emphasized in the features of element 2</span>. The third element (<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the threshold position</span></span>) differs from the others because it does not have a number of features, and it is not described in Bataille’s texts.

Of course, like the other times, I will fail. But first I would like to show you the extent of my failure. I can say precisely that if I had succeeded, the tangible contact between you and me would have the nature not of work but of play. I would have known how to make you perceive what is for me a decisive fact; the only object of my thought is play, and in play my thought, the work of my thought, is annihilated (USN 120). Drawing this out will require explaining all four elements of nonknowledge. We can already see that the features of the four elements of nonknowledge are significantly different from the presumptions made in the virtue epistemology conversation. Taking these differences seriously and making them explicit is the chief aim of this document. By the end of this document, however, I will argue that we can see these elements and features of nonknowledge at play in the virtue epistemology conversation, and that<span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>nonknowledge can in fact be seen as a feature of knowledge-creation</span></span><span class='card-underline'> of the kind we see in the virtue epistemology discussion, as an expression of classical epistemology, and of philosophy. </span>I will argue additionally (in chapter 3) that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>nonknowledge is best understood as “</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>epistemic expenditure,”</span></span> and as <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>a</span></span><span class='card-underline'>n open, or </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>general, economy</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> Building on this, I will return to the <span class='card-underline'>virtue epistemology conversation in order to claim that what at first looks like a closed, or restricted economy</span> (viz., the virtue epistemology conversation) is in fact an open, or general economy, with nonknowledge (understood as epistemic expenditure) already occurring within it. This claim requires some additional claims. I will identify them here before discussing them fully in the coming chapters. <span class='card-underline'>They are: (1) that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the virtue epistemology presumptions are an adaptation to the excess</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, the waste, that is nonknowledge; (2) that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the elements of nonknowledge occur in virtue epistemology</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, without being recognized</span> or identified; and thus (3) <span class='card-underline'>that what the classical presumptions suggest is </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the entire story</span></span><span class='card-underline'>—or a complete conversation—</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is in fact an incomplete story</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, or conversation.</span></p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>The will to productivity subsumes the world, entrapping us within the virtue epistemology, a closed economy of knowledge.

But this larger distancing movement from animality has also been erased from late modernity's consciousness.

New possibilities of thought become available once that structure has been suspended and non-philosophy is an index of those philosophically un-envisageable possibilities (“Axiomatic Heresy: The non-philosophy of François Laruelle,” Radical Philosophy 121, p. 25). If nonknowledge were “a-knowledge” it would be the absence of knowledge. If it were “ir knowledge” or “un-knowledge,” it would be the negation of knowledge. Sticking with the Latin roots, nonknowledge is closer to “not-knowledge.” But this cannot mean that nonknowledge is strictly not-knowledge. The relationship of nonknowledge to knowledge can be explained with Bataille’s description of what makes excess possible: “[O]nly the impossibility of continuing growth makes way for squander. Hence the real excess does not begin until the growth of the individual or group has reached its limits” (Accursed Share 29). At full epistemic capacity, what could have been useful intellectual activity becomes excessive, wasteful intellectual activity. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Nonknowledge is</span></span><span class='card-underline'> thus not ignorance or total absence of knowledge, but </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>a challenging not-knowing that occurs at a limit</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>—at the</span></span><span class='card-underline'> continuous and permanent </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>threshold of—knowing</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. Because in the next chapter we will see that I am calling nonknowledge epistemic expenditure, I maintain that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>its most easily identifiable incarnations occur when a limit in thought</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, in thinking, in problem-solving—in </span>88 “<span class='card-underline'>useful” mental activity—</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is crossed</span></span>. When thought has “exhausted its resources,” (Sasso ibid) pushed past a limit of usefulness. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Nonknowledge is</span></span><span class='card-underline'> thus </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>an alternate epistemology</span></span>. Following the “non” of Laruelle, nonknowledge makes “new possibilities of thought” available (Brassier ibid). Bataille did not identify nonknowledge’s position as a threshold position, but he did lay the groundwork for my description. According to Bataille, nonknowledge occurs as a natural, necessary byproduct of the dissolution of knowledge (AC 74), which itself occurs at the height of knowledge, only when the “summit” of knowledge is reached (ibid). [K]nowledge leads to the limit, because knowledge as a willful comportment is motivated by a relation to the limit. Just as the interdit called for transgression, through an intimate accord hidden within its illusory opposition, knowledge calls to non-savoir as its violent complement, its hidden condition, its silent end. ‘The nonessence of the will to know arises’: it is not reason that motivates the desire to know—no more than it was reason that instituted the interdit. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The desire to know </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is violent</span></span><span class='card-underline'>—is violence</span> […] <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>It is</span></span><span class='card-underline'> an exigency </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>conditioned</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> by </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>survival and</span></span><span class='card-underline'> by </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>death</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.

We can experience a limit as a final limit—a necessary stopping-point—or <span class='card-underline'>we can see if </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the limit is not</span></span><span class='card-underline'> perhaps </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>as final</span></span><span class='card-underline'> or as real </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>as it seems</span></span>. <span class='card-underline'>Understanding</span> that <span class='card-underline'>limits</span> are thresholds is the key. This is a quasi-Deleuzian point. “Deleuze has an almost mathematical definition of the limit, <span class='card-underline'>as that which one never really reaches</span>.56” (Rosi Braidotti, “The Ethics of Becoming Imperceptible,” Deleuze and Philosophy 10). Thus <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>understanding</span></span> the position of <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>nonknowledge</span></span> in relation to knowledge <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is not a matter of</span></span><span class='card-underline'> determining exactly </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>where knowledge “ends” and nonknowledge “begins”; </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>it is a moment when we are faced with something unthinkable,</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>unknowable</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, un-communicable, or even heretical, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>and it is a matter of understanding that moment</span></span><span class='card-underline'> not as a final marker of a limit, but </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>as a threshold</span></span>. As somewhere between clear thought or discourse (that which can be clearly, reliably communicated, translated into knowledge, or seen as a contribution to the accepted scholarship) and something like a-knowledge or un-knowledge: a wild and entirely indescribable terrain. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>When we have utterly exhausted</span></span><span class='card-underline'> or clicked off </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>our thinking</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and knowing resources, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>we begin to arrive in the region of nonknowledge</span></span>. We’ve seen that this is perhaps uniquely possible in erotic experience, but it is not limited to thinking or knowing during, or about, erotic experience. Nonknowledge can occur when we are wondering about the structure of the universe. It can happen when a child asks us what time is. Certain events or experiences can occasion nonknowledge, but they are not the form of nonknowledge. <span class='card-underline'>In keeping with the threshold position of nonknowledge, we will see that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>it is a part of knowledge and knowledge-creation</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, despite the fact that virtue epistemology</span>—and epistemology in general—<span class='card-underline'>seeks to</span> strictly <span class='card-underline'>limit what kinds of processes or procedures can result in knowledge, and thereby excludes processes that might be nonknowledge</span>.

The <span class='card-underline'>meaning that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>nonmeaning</span></span><span class='card-underline'> has</span>, according to Bataille, <span class='card-underline'>is the meaning contained in the fact that it (nonmeaning) </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>intoxicates</span></span><span class='card-underline'> him. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>This is an </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>affective meaning</span></span>.

From this it would seem that <span class='card-underline'>Sartre’s criticism of inner experience as mere “emptiness” is a claim </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>that </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>inner experience</span></span><span class='card-underline'> does not have adequate or satisfactory ends</span><span class='card-underline'>. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>“Emptiness”</span></span><span class='card-underline'> in this sense </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is</span></span><span class='card-underline'> an accusation of </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>a lack of telos</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> Bataille is not bothered by this. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Bataille wanted inner experience to be </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>aimless but affectively productive</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> This is significant with regard to knowledge and nonknowledge: <span class='card-underline'>Sartre is right in relation to me to recall the myth of Sisyphus</span>, though ‘in relation to me’ here equates to ‘in relation to humanity,’ I suppose. <span class='card-underline'>What can be expected of us is to go as far as possible and not to stop</span>. What by contrast, humanly speaking, can be criticized are endeavors whose only meaning is some relation to moments of completion. <span class='card-underline'>Is it possible for me to go further? I won’t wait to coordinate my efforts in that case—I’ll go further. I’ll take the risk.</span> And readers, free not to venture after me, will often take advantage of that same freedom! <span class='card-underline'>The critics are right to scent danger here! But let me in turn point out a greater danger</span>, one that comes from methods that, adequate only to an outcome of knowledge, <span class='card-underline'>confer on individuals whom they limit a sheerly fragmentary existence—an existence that is mutilated with respect to the whole that remains inaccessible</span> (ON 174-5). <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>If inner experience were not aimless</span></span><span class='card-underline'>—if it had a simple, definitive outcome—</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the outcome would be knowledge</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. And experience is necessarily different from methods of contemplation and contestation which set out with knowledge as their outcome. Hence inner experience’s relation to nonknowledge: </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>inner experience produces some absence of knowledge, and it does not seek knowledge</span></span><span class='card-underline'> or anything in particular as a goal, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>paving the way for nonknowledge</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. Inner experience is also different from “methods” which require an individual to live a “fragmentary existence</span>,” separate and apart from some “whole” which remains inaccessible to them. This <span class='card-underline'>separation from some whole is a greater danger than the danger of a task as Sisyphean as endless contestation.</span> Bataille’s claim that <span class='card-underline'>inner experience is not the kind of method which requires individuals to live fragmentedly,</span> and separate, from some essential whole recalls his distinction between “continuity” and “discontinuity.” <span class='card-underline'>Bataille is suggesting that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>inner experience allows him to live with access to a whole</span></span><span class='card-underline'>—as part of the whole—that would otherwise</span> (with other methods) <span class='card-underline'>remain inaccessible</span>. The method which <span class='card-underline'>entails inaccessibility to the whole recalls discontinuity, and the method of being part of or caught up in the whole</span> (inner experience) <span class='card-underline'>recalls continuity</span>. It matters little what particular “method” or methods Bataille is using to describe inner experience. <span class='card-underline'>What matters in identifying such methods is that they are </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>methods that expect knowledge</span></span><span class='card-underline'> as the outcome and that they achieve the outcome by </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>limit</span></span><span class='card-underline'>ing </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>individuals to </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>fragmentary existences</span></span><span class='card-underline'> without access to the whole of which they are seeking part (in the form of “knowledge”). </span>We will not see this concern for continuity in our virtue epistemology conversation, nor will we see knowledge characterized as fragmenting, or splintering. In Sensible Ecstasy, Amy Hollywood offers her analysis of Jean-Paul Sartre’s critique of Bataille in relation to Bataille’s desire for continuity over and above any desire for identifiable outcomes: “Sartre’s and Bataille’s opposing attitudes toward human projects are crucial here. Sartre insists that to be human is to engage in projects; <span class='card-underline'>Bataille argues that inner experience is the opposite of project”</span> (30). (And inner experience is especially not a project of self-improvement.) <span class='card-underline'>Thus Bataille “generates endlessly recursive negations of his own attempt to provide a method for attaining inner experience</span>” (ibid). <span class='card-underline'>According to Hollywood, this is ultimately the problem Sartre has with all of Inner </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Experience</span></span><span class='card-underline'>; that is, it has no method, it offers no clear goal, it </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is useless</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, it is not a </span>project. “For Sartre, if inner experience does not give rise to new enterprises it is worth nothing more than ‘the pleasure of drinking a glass of alcohol or of warming oneself in the sun at the beach’ [ON 173]. Such experiences are, for Sartre, ‘useless’” (SE 31). Excesses are permissible for Sartre, Hollywood writes, as long as they are channeled fully into project—whether the project is political or personal. “Only if these excesses are contained by project can they be meaningful and useful” (SE 33). However, the intoxication that inner experience and its nonmeaning produce are all we need to reply to Sartre: <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>nonmeaning is not a total absence of meaning. Nonmeaning provides</span></span><span class='card-underline'> some kind of </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>meaning in the form</span></span><span class='card-underline'> of intoxication, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>of </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>affect</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. We will see that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the same is true of nonknowledge</span></span><span class='card-underline'>: nonknowledge is not a total absence of knowledge, and its clearest meaning is an affective meaning. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Nonknowledge does not have a</span></span><span class='card-underline'> particular kind of </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>recuperable use</span></span>. Inner Experience, Inner Experience, and Nonknowledge <span class='card-underline'>Bataille closes his reply to Sartre with a description of inner experience itself: it is the movement of “willing a knowledge beyond practical ends</span>” (ON 176). Bataille acknowledges that <span class='card-underline'>this willing “can’t be indefinitely continued</span>” (ibid). <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Knowledge “beyond practical ends” is nonknowledge</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. Inner Experience</span> (the text and the concept) <span class='card-underline'>is thus a method and a non-method for arriving at nonknowledge</span>. If reading <span class='card-underline'>Inner Experience</span> moves one to pursue experience, it <span class='card-underline'>opens up the possibility of arriving at nonknowledge</span>. The “<span class='card-underline'>method” inspires anguish because it produces only knowledge beyond practical ends—useless pseudo-knowledge</span>. The <span class='card-underline'>method looks, sounds, and seems like mystical ecstasy from the outside, but, according to Bataille, it can be and is understood differently from the “inside</span>55.” The method of <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>inner experience</span></span><span class='card-underline'> is not just an avenue to nonknowledge; it </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is</span></span><span class='card-underline'> partially </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>constitutive of nonknowledge. </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>It is an element of nonknowledge</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>.</span></span></p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Our <span class='card-underline'>experience</span> of nonknowledge necessarily requires breaking normative values and authoritative structures – our jamming of discourse is the only way for communication to occur</div><div class='cite'>Lerman 15 (Lindsay Lerman, PhD in Philosophy from The University of Guelph, Ontario, supervised by Shannon Winnubst (yeeee), “Georges Bataille's "Nonknowledge" as Epistemic Expenditure: An Open Economy of Knowledge”, 2015, https://atrium.lib.uoguelph.ca/xmlui/handle/10214/8994 ///ghs-sc)</div><div class='card-body'><p>***edited for gendered language</p><p>Thus, in Inner Experience we find two important claims that can help us define Bataillean communication and determine communication’s relationship to nonknowledge: (1) <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>We cannot find</span></span><span class='card-underline'> the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>words to describe</span></span><span class='card-underline'> experiences of </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>nonknowledge, but </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>we must attempt a description of nonknowledge</span></span> anyhow.

We also find (2) that something about the experience of nonknowledge does not allow us to describe it. This “something” is present in all communication, but is emphasized or highlighted in nonknowledge.

Since <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>analysis</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, commentary, and criticism </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>always lead somewhere</span></span>, or, more importantly, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>are teleological and utility-oriented</span></span><span class='card-underline'> pursuits, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>they will never be “caught in the</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>movement” of inner experience</span></span> (On Nietzsche 170-3).

Maybe knowing is affirmation—after the fact, after recovery from inner experience—of “inner experience.” Secondly, and strangely, if <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>inner experience can only “be grasped by those experiencing it</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>for themselves,” commentary, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>analysis</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, or criticism, which are from afar, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>cannot lead</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>anywhere</span></span>, just as the experience cannot lead anywhere. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Analysis</span></span><span class='card-underline'> or criticism </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>cannot take</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the place of experience</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, and as such, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>they serve as a kind of dead description</span></span>. They describe something that must be experienced in order to be “grasped.” In this sense, criticism, analysis, and commentary are not unlike inner experience: they too “don’t lead anywhere” (On Nietzsche 173).</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Their DA is the academy attempting to silence the radical potentiality of Bataille’s work</div><div class='cite'>DeBoer 14 (Jason DeBoer runs a literary and philosophical publishing house called Trembling Sun Press in Chicago, “Bataille vs. Theory,” ///ghs-sc)</div><div class='card-body'><p>The writings of Georges Bataille have recently become the object of a certain resurgence, or rather, a recuperation, within the academy. As Bataille’s death in 1962 recedes into the past, the number of critical essays and articles about him continues to grow at an incredible rate. Most of this <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>criticism has taken the approach of situating Bataille and his ideas into a pre-determined framework of “postmodern” thought</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, either through the systematic embellishment of his role as an intellectual influence on Foucault, Derrida, and others, or his role as an intermediary figure between Nietzsche and the French postmodernists</span>. While there certainly is merit and validity in linking Bataille intellectually to these writers, <span class='card-underline'>it is </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the radicalness</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and originality </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>of Bataille’s writing which</span></span><span class='card-underline'> ultimately </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>becomes lost in these analyses</span></span><span class='card-underline'> when viewed through such an historical lens. It seems inevitable that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Bataille</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, like Nietzsche, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>will be subjected to</span></span><span class='card-underline'> a critical </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>scrutiny, which,</span></span><span class='card-underline'> in the guise of earnest analyses and close readings, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>serves foremost to dispel the threat that such writers pose to academia</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>. A calculated process of intellectual taming is deployed against these radical thinkers</span></span><span class='card-underline'>; this procession of commentaries and dissections nearly always leaves nothing but a dilution of the original work.</span> To avoid this, I will not concern myself with situating Bataille’s writings within the present state of theory (whether it be philosophical, critical, sociological, or psychological). Rather, I think it would be more noble to attempt a critique of the theoretical enterprise by analyzing it through Bataille’s own array of concepts. If the ideas of thinkers like Nietzsche, Sade, or Bataille are to be afforded the credence they deserve, it is only fitting that theory itself be judged according to their claims, which may run in opposition to the claims made by traditional theory</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>All organisms and system are left with a surplus of energy, which we should squander endlessly.

For Trungpa, the sun is a symbol of basic goodness, and the human capacity to awaken to it, to become enlightened. For Bataille, the sun is the material starting point for earthly life, and thus his phi- losophy. <span class='card-underline'>“</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Solar energy</span></span><span class='card-underline'>,” writes Bataille, “</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is the source of life’s exuberant development</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. The origin and essence of our wealth are given in the radiation of the sun, which dispenses energy—wealth—without any return.”65 The sun offers our planet enough energy in one hour to meet contemporary civilizational needs for an entire year</span>.66 Harnessing this energy, to be sure, is a massive technological challenge. Moreover, biological life only has limited access to the superabundance of solar energy that hits the planet every day. But the amount of energy we can access enables an energetically rich life. <span class='card-underline'>Bataille’s materialist analysis of solar lavishness helpfully concretizes Trungpa’s account of basic goodness, what he also referred to as “basic richness.”</span>67 While Trungpa o ers practices for people to feel their inherent goodness and richness, actually experiencing this goodness takes time.68 Without spending hours meditating, and slowly uncovering a tender and radiating heart, Trungpa’s teachings on basic goodness and richness can appear ideal- istic. <span class='card-underline'>Bataille’s materialist account of solar generosity further evidences Trungpa’s philosophy; it offers strong conceptual proof that can heighten commitment to the experiential practice of meditation. “ </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The sun gives without ever receiving</span></span><span class='card-underline'>,” argues Bataille. </span>“[Humans] were conscious of this long before astrophysics measured that ceaseless prodigality; they saw it ripen the harvests and they associated its splen- dor with the act of someone who gives without receiving.”69At a basic biological level, the sun’s exuberance means that “on the surface of the globe, for living matter in general, energy is always in excess, the ques- tion is always posed in terms of extravagance.”70 Put more succinctly: “<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>We receive more energy than we can use</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.”</span>71 e basic planetary con- dition is wealth more than poverty. <span class='card-underline'>The essential meaning of Bataille’s claim that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>luxury</span></span><span class='card-underline'>—not necessity—</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>organizes life on earth</span></span><span class='card-underline'> is that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>all organisms have access to more energy than required</span></span><span class='card-underline'> for subsistence, thanks to the sun’s exuberance</span><span class='card-underline'>, is </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>excess is often invested in biological growth</span></span><span class='card-underline'> (at the level of an organism, species, or ecosystem). But </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>growth can never fully exhaust the energy available</span></span><span class='card-underline'> to an individual organism or biological system. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>All organisms and systems are left with a surplus to spend</span></span><span class='card-underline'> “willingly or not, gloriously or catastrophically.”</span>72 Evidence of earthly richness includes the ornate colors and plumage of the animal kingdom that seemingly exceed evolutionary use-value. Similarly, consider the capacity for pleasure su using animal life, espe- cially all the sexualized pleasures apparently unrelated to procreation. Even when a sensory pleasure is associated with basic functioning like a good sneeze, excretion, or stretch, there can still be sumptuousness to the sensation (need it feel so good?). A sneeze is arguably basic good- ness at work, a ash of solar exuberance amidst our everyday lives. Consider, also, the ubiquity of queerness across the animal king- dom. According to Bruce Bagemihl, author of Biological Exuberance (a book that draws heavily from Bataille), “homosexuality is found in virtually all animal groups, in virtually all geographic areas and time periods, and in a wide variety of forms.”73 But why, asks Bagemihl, “does same-sex activity persist—reappearing in species after species, generation after generation, individual after individual—when it is not useful” from a strictly evolutionary perspective?74 Bagemihl’s answer is that use and necessity are not life’s sole organizing principles: “Natural systems are driven as much by abundance and excess as they are by limitation and practicality. Seen in this light, homosexuality and non- reproductive heterosexuality are ‘expected’ occurrences—they are one manifestation of an overall ‘extravagance’ of biological systems that has many expressions.”75 <span class='card-underline'>For Bataille, our primordial condition is marked by richness thanks to the lavishness of the sun.

We lie to ourselves when we dream of escaping the movement of luxurious exuberance of which we are only the most intense form.”76 </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Death’s energetic squandering is</span></span><span class='card-underline'> also </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>an ecological gift</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> for</span></span><span class='card-underline'> the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>new life</span></span><span class='card-underline'> arising from decay: </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>“[Humankind] conspires to ignore the fact that </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>death is also the youth of things</span></span>.”77 Bataille’s reading of death as exemplary of basic goodness supports Trungpa’s encouragement to <span class='card-underline'>“</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>make friends with our death</span></span><span class='card-underline'>,” and to not resentfully cast it as “a defeat and as an insult.”78 Tibetan culture, according to Bataille, is more successful than Euro-American ones at affirming the totality of life.</span> For Bataille, cultur- al forms that communicate this a rmation are glorious expenditures of basic energetic wealth. e resentment that animates so many Eu- ro-American cultural forms is itself enabled by energetic exuberance, a “catastrophic” use of our basic richness.79 And the Euro-American desire to escape our corporeality only intensi es feelings of lack and malaise by disconnecting us from the earthly exuberance alive in our changeful bodies. For Bataille: <span class='card-underline'>Anguish arises when the anxious individual is not himself stretched tight by the feeling of superabundance</span>. is is precisely what evinces the isolated, individual character of anguish. ere can be anguish only from a personal, par- ticular point of view that is radically opposed to the general point of view based on the exuberance of living matter as a whole. Anguish is meaningless for someone who over ows with life, and for life as a whole, which is an over owing by its very nature.80 Energetic poverty and lack are realities for life on earth. But they are always felt by particular beings at particular times; energetic lack is not our general or basic condition. And yet the more we separate ourselves from exuberant life energies in attempts to gain dominion over them, the more liable we are to experience lack; we progressively remove our- selves from nature’s over ow. Bataille was interested in nurturing a sovereign—rather than ser- vile—human encounter with existence: “ e sovereignty I speak of has little to do with the sovereignty of states... I speak in general of an aspect that is opposed to the servile and the subordinate.”81 Viewing humans as agents of life’s exuberance, Bataille saw sovereignty as hu- manity’s “primordial condition.”82 <span class='card-underline'>We are regal and rich from birth.

Bataille's notion of <span class='card-underline'>death is</span> an empty version of Hegel's: it is <span class='card-underline'>negativity, but one that cannot be recuperated</span>, even if all our actions can be seen as attempts at such a recuperation. <span class='card-underline'>Death is the loss that defines our existence as individuals, since sexual reproduction is absolutely caught up with the death of the individual</span>; unlike amoebae, there is no continuity of Being from one organism to the next (The Accursed Share, 32; OC VII, 39. See also Eroticism, 12-15; OCX, 17-21). Death, then, is as much part of the inherent wastefulness in nature as life. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Death seems</span></span><span class='card-underline'> to us like </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the most wasteful form</span></span>, but for Bataille, such a conception is to be left behind (not ignored or overcome): 'the luxury of death is regarded by us in the same way as that of sexuality, first as a negation of ourselves, then - in a sudden reversal - as the profound truth of that movement of which life is the manifestation (The Accursed Share, 34-5; OC VII, 41). Is death then in some way the truth of Bataille's system? At points it recalls Heidegger's notion of 'Being toward death', but as with many of Bataille's notions, the whole issue of centrality is open to question even as it is posed. Bataille argues that it will always be possible to show that whichever primordial fact gets priority presuppose s the existence of anothe r one (The Accursed Share, vol. II, 82; OC VIII, 71). 1 Death features in early writings - 'beings only die to be born', 'Solar Anus', 7; OC I, 84), and become s something that does not transcend the individual so much as lose the individual in a generalized excess. Instead of Hegel's mastery of death, <span class='card-underline'>we see that in the fact that life and death are passionately devoted to the subsidence of the void, the relation of master/slave subordination is no longer revealed, but life and void are confused and mingled like lovers, in the convulsive moments of the end. </span>('Sacrifices', 133; OC I, 93 trans, mod.) <span class='card-underline'>Instead of giving in to death, accepting it at a distance, as the distancing that structure s Being (Heidegger), </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>death is to be embraced</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, as 'it appears that no less a loss than </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>death is needed for the brilliance of life</span></span><span class='card-underline'> to traverse and transfigure dull existence</span> (Th e Practice of Joy Before Death', 239; OC I, 557). This is not because death is so marvellous, but because it is everywhere, linking the individual to everything else (what Bataille will go on to call the general economy): I can only perceive a succession of cruel splendours whose very movement requires that I die: this death is only the exploding consumption of all that was, the joy of existence of all that comes into the world; even my own life demands that everything that exists, everywhere, ceaselessly give itself and be annihilated. (The Practice of Joy Before Death', 239; OCI, 557) Bataille is not arguing from the perspective whereby the universe only exists in one's own mind, but that even we, pathetic individuals that we are, feature in the ceaseless process of death and destruction. This linkage of the individual, throug h death, to others, to the general economy, is what is pursued in Bataille's connecting of the erotic with death, which is a development of the linkage between sex and death. In Eroticism he uses the term 'continuity to designate both the state of shared existence of asexual reproduction and what lies beyond individuality when individuals lose themselves in sacrifice, erotic activity, laughter, drunkenness and so on (Eroticism, 11-25; OCX, 17-30). These attempts interest him because 'eroticism opens the way to death. Death opens the way to the denial of our individual selves (24; 29). Death 57 The second volume of The Accursed Share, subtitled The History of Eroticism, is often seen as being little more than a draft version of Eroticism, but there are crucial differences in emphasis. The History of Eroticism really is a genuine part of the work on 'the accursed share', whereas such an economy is only implicit in Eroticism. More importantly still, the former seeks to link sexuality to death, and the latter attempts the opposite movement (both movements, for no clear theoretically necessary reason, lead Bataille to associate Woman with death). The second volume of The Accursed Share even starts by stating that it is not really about eroticism, but is instead 'a thinking that does not fall apart in the face of horror', emerging from 'a system of thought exhausting the totality of the possible (The Accursed Share, vol. II, 14; OC VIII, 10). In writing about death as part of the general economy, it also emerges that death is not necessarily literal death. But we should on no account take it as simply a metaphor, as metaphors imply a reality to be represented, and Bataille offers no such real world, existing to be represented in mimesis, metaphor or metonymy. <span class='card-underline'>Death and Fear </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Hegel sees death as the origin of</span></span><span class='card-underline'> humanity's </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>self-consciousness</span></span> (this being, initially, consciousness of death), <span class='card-underline'>and the rest of time consists of the struggle to master death.</span> Communal existence is also centred around death, and the two combine in the form of architecture. According to Hollier, for Hegel, <span class='card-underline'>'architecture is something appearing in the place of death, to point out its presence and to cover it up: the victory of death and the victory over death'</span> (Against Architecture, 6). For Bataille, however, this is precisely the problem: our society is this fearful covering up of death (whereas the Aztecs, for example, exposed death in the sacrifice - at the top of, rather than inside, the pyramid). 2 In The Accursed Share, vol. II, he argues that <span class='card-underline'>all </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>society</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, all individual existence </span>(as opposed to the restricted economy of modern individualism) <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>emerges from this fear of death</span></span><span class='card-underline'> - and this fear is at its most creative when it approaches death. </span>58 Georges Bataille At the same time as <span class='card-underline'>humanity is drawn toward death,</span> it pushes it away - <span class='card-underline'>this repulsion is what defines humanity. </span>Repulsion is the key word, as <span class='card-underline'>death is not simply a negativity, something that happens to the subject, but something that, even when it happens to someone else, provokes disgust. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Humanity is defined by its 'repugnance for death</span></span>/ (The Accursed Share, vol. II, 61; OC VIII, 51). This is hardly a novel or shocking statement, but <span class='card-underline'>death is specifically part of what repels us because we repel it, and arguably the (primordial) object of disgust (and only in becoming human does death constitute something disgusting). </span>Humans have a horror of all that threatens their unitary existence: excretions, filth, loss of control through drunkenness, eroticism (61-2; 51-2). More than this, we also have a horror of life, as at some level we are aware of life as a by-product of death, so much so that 'we might think, if need be, that living<span class='card-underline'> </span>matter on the very level we separate ourselves from it is the privileged object of our disgust (63; 52). All such disgusts are caught up within taboos, in a relation where it is impossible to ascertain whether the taboo created the disgust, or responds to it. For Bataille, however, death really is at the heart of the existence of taboo, but is not the exclusive centre: since it goes without saying, I will not linger over the possible anteriority of the horror of death. This horror is perhaps at the root of our repugnance (the loathing of nothingness would then be at the origin of the loathing of decay, which is not physical since it is not shared by animals) . It is clear, in any event, that the nature of excrement is analogous to that of corpses and that the places of its emission are close to the sexual parts; more often than not, this complex of prohibitions appears inextricable. (79; 68) This complex marks the line of demarcation between human and other and proximity to these phenomena constitutes the crossing of this line. This crossing and the fear of crossing gives the 'universally human character of the problem of obscenity (54; 45), even if contra Freud and Levi-Strauss, for example, there is no particular taboo that is universal.3 <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Death</span></span><span class='card-underline'> is also 'at the beginning insofar as its appearance </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>coincides with labour and utility - this is what makes death a problem</span></span><span class='card-underline'> for the individual, as </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the individual conceives of his or her self as something to be maintained</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, preserved and developed</span> (82; 70) .<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Death</span></span><span class='card-underline'> very rapidly </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>becomes the site of prohibition</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, and takes two principal forms: both murder and 'contact with corpses are forbidden</span> (79; 68). It is not the metaphysical difficulty of impending death that creates this fear, since this arises from an awareness that life is an accident between waste and decay, with only waste and decay in between. As Bataille notes, life is a luxury of which death is the highest degree (85-6; 74) and 'moreover, life is a product of putrefaction (80; 69), so <span class='card-underline'>death and decay are linked to conceptions of our birth and origin </span>(for him, this accounts for 'our fear of menstrual blood, for example). Here, as elsewhere, it is striking how far Bataille goes down a road attacking preconceptions only to launch into a restatement of tired cliches about 'woman as other, as death. He simply does not question the taboos around 'woman', and this is why Kristeva's gloss on Bataille (Powers of Horror) and Mary Douglas's Purity and Danger is so successful - it completes the logic already under way. The all-pervasive absence, or denial, of death, through prohibition, is why death is to be approached, and also why we have an attraction to as well as repulsion from death and all that threatens our identity, so that for example, 'eroticism, it may be said, is assenting to life up to the point of death (Eroticism, 11; OCX, 17). Death and eroticism remain charged with danger, and create anguish in individuals as their individuality falls away (The Accursed Share, vol. II, 101; OC VIII, 88) . 5 But as with Hegel's 'facing up to death', Bataille does not limit the notion of death to actual biological death - it comes to include all that undoes the individual, such that the introduction, or irruption, of death into life makes life become exuberant (99; 86). Erotic activity, for example, must be carried out intensely (otherwise it is just sex), for 'if the sensations do not have their greatest intensity, it is possible for us to isolate objects on the field of the totality (118-19; 102). By totality, <span class='card-underline'>Bataille does not mean the kinds of ideology that account for everything, but the amorphous sphere beyond subjects, and beyond a simple subject/object divide. Even if death is not real, there is no reduction of the experience of approaching death</span> (we can never attain death - in this Bataille is with Heidegger). If <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>we are instructed that to 'live life to the full we must 'embrace death'</span></span>, what do we gain? Nothing much, except the awareness of an impossibility (we do not even gain nothing, as asceticism would aspire to), but what will have happened is the following: the embrace restores us, not to nature (which is itself, if it is not reintegrated, only a detached part), but rather to the totality in which man has his share by losing himself. For an embrace is not just a fall into the animal muck, but the anticipation of death, and the putrefaction that follows it. (119; 103) There is no why, however, and there can only be Virtuar replies to 'why? - i.e. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>there can be the project of approaching death</span></span>, as it enhances subjectivity, <span class='card-underline'>but </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>this project is lost at the moment it is attained,</span></span><span class='card-underline'> whether in actual death or in death-like experience (nonexperience).</span> Note also that the only 'return is to something that is necessarily lost, again and again. Eroticism, then, is one direction waste or excess can take that involves death (itself waste, excess), but <span class='card-underline'>Bataille also hints at another level at which death can be approached - a level that really is metaphorical.</span></p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>They ignore that death is the youth of things – the impacts the aff has identified are nothing but a balancing of the disequilibrium of life.

The unity of pleaning of these taboos should finally be clear from studies of their various aspects. We come up against one difficulty at the start: the taboos I regard as fundamental affect two radically different fields. Death and reproduction are as diametrically opposed as negation and affirmation. Death is really the opposite process to the process ending in birth, yet these opposite processes can be reconciled. The death of the one being is correlated with the birth of the other, heralding it and making it possible. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Life is</span></span><span class='card-underline'> always </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>a product of the decomposition of life</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. Life first pays its tribute to death which disappears, then to corruption following on death and bringing back into the cycle of change the matter necessary for the ceaseless arrival of new beings into the world</span>. Yet <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>life is</span></span><span class='card-underline'> none the less </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>a </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>negation</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> of death</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. It condemns it and shuts it out. </span>This reaction is strongest in man, and horror at death is linked not only with <span class='card-underline'>the annihilation of the individual but also with the decay that sends the dead flesh back into the general ferment of life.</span> Indeed the deep respect for the solemn image of death found in idealistic civilisation alone comes out in radical opposition. Spontaneous physical revulsion keeps alive in some indirect fashion at least the consciousness that the terrifying face of death, its stinking putrefaction, are to be identified with the sickening primary condition of life. For primitive people the moment of greatest anguish is the phase of decomposition; when the bones are bare and white they are not intolerable as the putrefying flesh is, food for worms. In some obscure way the survivors perceive in the horror aroused by corruption a rancour and a hatred projected towards them by the dead man which it is the function of the rites of mourning to appease. But afterwards they feel that the whitening bones bear witness to that appeasement. The bones are objects of reverence to them and draw the first veil of decency and solemnity over death and make it bearable; it is painful still but free of the virulent activity of corruption. These white bones do not leave the survivors a prey to the slimy menace of disgust. They put an end to the close connections between decomposition, the source of an abundant surge of life, and death. But in an age more in touch with the earliest human reactions than ours, this connection appeared so necessary that even Aristotle said that certain <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>creatures</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, brought into being spontaneously,</span> as he thought, in earth or water, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>were born of corruption</span></span>) The generative power of corruption is a naive belief responding to the mingled horror and fascination aroused in us by decay. This belief is behind a belief we once held about nature as something wicked and shameful: <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>decay summed up the world we spring from and return to</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, and horror and shame were attached both to our birth and to our death.</span> That nauseous, rank and heaving matter, frightful to look upon, a ferment of life, teeming with worms, grubs and eggs, I That is how Aristotle thought of "spontaneous generation", which he believed to take place. is at the bottom of the decisive reactions we call nausea, disgust or repugnance. <span class='card-underline'>Beyond the annihilation to come which will fall with all its weight on the being I now am, which still waits to be called into existence, which can even be said to be about to exist rather than to exist (as if I did not exist here and now but in the future in store for me, though that is not what I am now) </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>death will proclaim my return to seething life</span></span>. Hence <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>I can anticipate and live in expectation of that multiple putrescence that anticipates its sickening triumph in my person.</span></span> Nausea and its general field <span class='card-underline'>When somebody dies we, the survivors, expecting the life of that man now motionless beside us to go on, find that our expectation has suddenly come to nothing at all.</span> A dead body cannot be called nothing at all, but that object, that corpse, is stamped straight off with the sign "nothing at all". <span class='card-underline'>For us survivors, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the corpse</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and its threat of imminent decay </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is no answer to any expectation</span></span><span class='card-underline'> like the one we nourished while that now prostrate man was still alive; it is the answer to a fear.</span> <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>This object</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, then, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>less than nothing</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and worse than nothing. It is entirely in keeping that fear, the basis of disgust, is not stimulated by a real danger. The threat in question cannot be justified objectively.</span> There is no reason to look at a man's corpse otherwise than at an animal's, at game that has been killed, for instance. The terrified recoiling at the sight of advanced decay is not of itself inevitable. Along with this sort of reaction we have a whole range of artificial behaviour. The horror we feel at the thought of a corpse is akin to the feeling we have at human excreta. What makes this association more compelling is our similar disgust at aspects of sensuality we call obscene. The sexual channels are also the bod y' s sewers; we think of them as shameful and connect the anal orifice with them. St. Augustine was at pains to insist on the obscenity of the organs and function of reproduction. "Inter faeces et urinam nascimur", he said-"we are born between faeces and urine". Our faecal products are not subject to a taboo formulated by meticulous social regulations like those relating to dead bodies or· to menstruation. But generally speaking, and though the relationship defies clear definition, there do exist unmistakable links between excreta, decay and sexuality. It may look as though physical circumstances imposed from without are chiefly operative in marking out this area of sensibility. But it also has its subjective aspect. The feeling of nausea varies with the individual and its material source is now one thing and now, another. After the living man the dead body is nothing at all; similarly nothing tangible or objective brings ·on our feeling of nausea; what we experience is a kind of void, a sinking sensation. We cannot easily discuss these things which in themselves are nothing at all. Yet they do make their presence felt and often they force themselves on the senses in a way that inert objects perceived objectively do not. How could' anyone assert that that stinking mass is nothing at all? But our protest, if we make one, implies our humiliation and our refusal to see. We imagine that it is the stink of excrement that makes us feel sick. But would it stink if we had not thought it was disgusting in the first place ? We do not take long to forget what trouble we go to to pass on to our children the aversions that make us what we are, which make us human beings to begin with. Our children do not spontaneously have our reactions. They may not like a certain food and they may refuse it. But we have to teach them by .pantomime or failing that, by violence, that curious aberration called disgust, powerful enough to make us feel faint, a contagion passed down to us from the earliest men through countless generatipns of scolded children. Our mistake is to take these teachings lightly. For thousands of years we have been h~ding them down to our children, but they used to have a different form. The realm of disgust and nausea is broadly the result of these teachings. The prodigality of life and our fear of it After reading this <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>we</span></span><span class='card-underline'> may </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>feel a void opening</span></span><span class='card-underline'> within us. </span>What I have been saying refers to this void and nothing else. But <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>void opens at a specific point. Death</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, for instance, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>may open it</span></span><span class='card-underline'>: the corpse into which death infuses absence, the putrefaction associated with this absence</span>. I can link <span class='card-underline'>my revulsion at the decay</span> (my imagination suggests it, not my memory, so profoundly is it a forbidden object for me) <span class='card-underline'>with the feelings that obscenity arouse in me. I can tell myself that repugnance and horror are the mainsprings of my desire, that such desire is only aroused as long as its object causes a chasm no less deep than death to yawn within me, and that this desire originates in its opposite, horror. From the outset reflections like these go beyond all reasonableness. It takes an iron nerve to perceive the connection between the promise of life implicit in eroticism and the sensuous aspect of death</span>. <span class='card-underline'>Mankind </span><span class='card-underline'>conspires to ignore the fact that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>death is</span></span><span class='card-underline'> also </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the youth of thing</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>s.</span></span> <span class='card-underline'>Blindfolded, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>we refuse to see that only death guarantees the fresh upsurging without which life would be blind. We refuse to see</span></span><span class='card-underline'> that life is the trap set for the balanced order, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>that life is nothing but instability and disequilibrium. Life is a swelling tumult continuously on the verge of explosion</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. But </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>since the incessant explosion constantly exhausts its resources, it can only proceed under one condition: that beings given life whose explosive force is exhausted shall make room for fresh beings coming into the cycle</span></span><span class='card-underline'> with renewed vigour.'</span> I Although this truth is generally ignored, Bossuet expounds it in his Sermon on Death (1662). "<span class='card-underline'>Nature</span>" he says "<span class='card-underline'>as if jealous of her gifts to us, often declares and makes plain the fact that she cannot leave: us for long in possession of the little substance she lends us, which must not remain always in the same hands but must be kept eternally in circulation. </span>She needs it for other forms, she asks for it to be returned for other works. Those continual additions to humankind, the children being born, seem to nudge us aside as they come forward, saying 'Back now; it is our tum'. So as we see others pass ahead of us, others will see us pass, and themselves present the same spectacle to their successors". A more extravagant procedure cannot be imagined. In one way life is possible, it could easily be maintained, without this colossal waste, this squandering annihilation at which imagination boggles. Compared with that of the infusoria, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the mammalian organism is a gulf that swallows vast quantities of energy</span></span>. This energy is not entirely wasted if it allows other developments to take place. But we must consider the devilish cycle from start to finish<span class='card-underline'>. The growth of vegetable life implies the continuous piling up of dissociated substances corrupted by death. Herbivorous creatures swallow vegetable matter by the heap before they themselves are eaten, victims of the carnivore's urge to </span>devour. Finally nothing is left but this fierce beast of prey or his remains, in their tum the prey of hyenas and worms. There is one way of considering this process in harmony with its nature: the more extravagant are the means of engendering life, the more costly is the production of new organisms, the more successful the operation is! The wish to produce at cut prices is niggardly and human. Humanity keeps to the narrow capitalist principle, that of the company director, that of the private individual who sells in order to rake in the accumulated credits in the long run (for raked in somehow they always are). <span class='card-underline'>On a comprehensive view, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>human life strives towards prodigality</span></span><span class='card-underline'> to the point of anguish, to the point where the anguish becomes unbearable. The rest is mere moralising chatter. How can this escape us if we look at it dispassionately? Everything proclaims it! </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>A febrile unrest within us asks death to wreak its havoc at our expense.</span></span> We go half way to meet these manifold trials, these false starts, this squandering of living strength in the transition from ageing beings to other younger ones. <span class='card-underline'>At bottom we actually want the impossible situation it all leads to: the isolation, the threat of pain, the horror of annihilation;</span> but for the sensation of nausea bound up with it, so horrible that often in silent panic we regard the whole thing as impossible, we should not be satisfied. <span class='card-underline'>But our judgments are formed under the influence of recurring disappointments and the obstinate expectation of a calm which goes hand in hand with that desire; our capacity to make ourselves understood is in direct ratio with the blindness we cling to</span>. For at the crest of the convulsion, which gives us shape <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the naive stubbornness that hopes that it will cease can only increase the torment, and this allows life</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, wholly committed to this gratuitous pattern, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>to add the luxury of a beloved torment to fatality</span></span>. For if <span class='card-underline'>man is condemned to be a luxury in himself, what is one to say of the luxury that is anguish?</span> Man's "no" to Nature When all is said and done <span class='card-underline'>human reactions</span> are what <span class='card-underline'>speed up the process; anguish speeds it up and makes it more keenly felt at the same time.</span> In general man's attitude is one of refusal. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Man has leant over backwards</span></span><span class='card-underline'> in order not to be carried away by the process, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>but all he manages to do</span></span><span class='card-underline'> by this </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is to hurry it along</span></span><span class='card-underline'> at an even dizzier speed</span>. If we <span class='card-underline'>view the primary taboos as the refusal laid down by the individual to co-operate with nature regarded as a squandering of living energy and an orgy of annihilation </span>we can no longer differentiate between death and sexuality. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Sexuality and death are simply the culminating points of the holiday</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, nature celebrates, with the inexhaustible multitude of living beings, both of them </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>signifying the boundless wastage of nature's resources</span></span><span class='card-underline'> as opposed to the urge to live on characteristic of every living creature</span>.

In the parallels perceived by the human mind between putrefaction and the various aspects of sexual activity the feelings of revulsion which set us against both end by mingling. The taboos embodying a single dual purpose reaction may have taken shape one at a time, and one can even imagine a long time elapsing between the taboo connected with death and the one connected with reproduction (often the most perfect things take shape hesitatingly through successive modifications). But we perceive their unity none the less: we feel we are dealing with an indivisible complex, just as if <span class='card-underline'>man had once and for all realised how impossible it is for nature (as a given force) to exact from the beings that she brings forth their participation in the destructive and implacable frenzy that animates her.</span> <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Nature demands their surrender</span></span><span class='card-underline'>; or rather she asks them to go crashing headlong to their own ruin. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Humanity became possible at the instant when</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, seized by an insurmountable dizziness, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>man tried to answer "No".</span></span> Man tried?

We feel this pressure in moments when instances of suffering and loss are expected to produce or express some reassuring meaning (everything happens for a reason; that person got what he deserved). <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>This mitigating process</span></span><span class='card-underline'> typically </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>happens when individuals</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and communities </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>locate death</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, suffering, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>and</span></span><span class='card-underline'> excessive </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>violence elsewhere</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, in another place and community—</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>a strategy that</span></span><span class='card-underline'> often </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>justifies</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and makes acceptable </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>violent projects</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> to fix</span></span><span class='card-underline'> or restore </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>that other community</span></span>. Therefore, when Bataille says that <span class='card-underline'>“death means everything” to the world of accumulation and duration</span>, he is thinking about how <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the anxiety and horror around death is related to our commitment to qpreserving ourselves in the future</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, a commitment that involves various forms of displacement and deferral</span>. In other words, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the will to futurity intensifies</span></span><span class='card-underline'> the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>anxiety and anguish that accompany</span></span><span class='card-underline'> thoughts and images of death, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>mortality</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, and vulnerability. </span>Of course, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>humans are</span></span><span class='card-underline'> also </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>fascinated</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> with images</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, and practices, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>of</span></span><span class='card-underline'> violence and </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>death, but only</span></span><span class='card-underline'> if they can experience and view these images </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>from a comfortable distance</span></span><span class='card-underline'> or participate in these practices in a manner that reduces the risks to the self’s coherence and duration</span>.9 On the duplicity of the self’s relationship to violence, Bataille writes, “<span class='card-underline'>Violence, and death signifying violence, have a double meaning. On the one hand </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the horror of death drives us off</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, for we prefer life; on </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the</span></span><span class='card-underline'> other an </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>element</span></span><span class='card-underline'> at once solemn and terrifying </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>fascinates us</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and disturbs us profoundly</span>” (Bataille 1986, 45). What is crucial here is that the order of things, the order of life preservation, is defined over and against death and loss—<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>death means everything to this order</span></span>. Yet I also take Bataille to be suggesting that everyday <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>projects</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and strategies </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>of selfpreservation are implicated in the</span></span><span class='card-underline'> mundane, often undetected, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>exploitation and suffering of others</span></span>; again, death means everything to the real world. Therefore, <span class='card-underline'>the human self is a site of a paradox: the world of projects, goals, and accumulation “imparts an unreal character to death even though man’s membership in this world is tied to the positing of the body as a thing insofar as it is mortal”</span> (Bataille 2006, 46). According to Bataille, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>our</span></span><span class='card-underline'> general </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>commitment to duration</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, to reproducing life, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>will always mean that some being</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, force, or desire </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>will be marked as a threat</span></span><span class='card-underline'> or danger to that reproduction</span>. And <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>those threats will have to be managed, assimilated, disciplined, or subordinated in some manner</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. One’s ability to endure in this world, to accumulate recognition, prestige, and various kinds of capital means that one must separate oneself, to some extent, from those qualities and characteristics that endanger self or communal projects and aspirations</span>. To put it differently, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>life needs to be cordoned off from death and tho</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>se beings associated with death</span></span> (even as we know that life and death are always intertwined and that certain kinds of subjects and communities are made more vulnerable to death and its intimations). Here Bataille’s line of thought converges with Baldwin’s point about social life providing a kind of barrier to “menacing” forces, to beings and desires that signify chaos and disorder. If Baldwin and Bataille are right, then racism, which is always about marking, disciplining, and managing “dangerous” bodies and communities, must be confronted alongside fundamental social and human limitations.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Recognizing the mortality inherent to human existence is essential to achieve liberation.

Kojeve wondered in what way satisfaction results from a familiarity with the negative, from a tete-a-tete with death. He believed it his duty, out of decency, to reject vulgar satisfaction.

Indeed, <span class='card-underline'>the desire to be 'recognized'</span>, which Hegel places at the origin of historical struggles, <span class='card-underline'>could be expressed in an intrepid attitude, of the sort that shows a character to its best advantage. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>'It is only'</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, says Kojeve, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>'in</span></span><span class='card-underline'> being or in </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>becoming aware of one's mortality</span></span><span class='card-underline'> or finitude, in existing and in feeling one's existence in a universe without a beyond or without a God, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>that Man can affirm </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>his liberty, his historicity and his individuality</span></span><span class='card-underline'> - "unique in all the world" - </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>and have them be recognized</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.' </span>(Ibid.).

Since appearance constitutes a limit, what truly exists is a dissolution into common opacity rather than a development of lucid thinking. The apparent unchangingness of books is deceptive: each book is also the sum of the misunderstandings it occasions</span>. <span class='card-underline'>So why exhaust myself with efforts toward consciousness? I can only make fun of myself as I write. (Why write even a phrase if laughter doesn't immediately join me?)</span> It goes without saying that, for the task, I bring to bear whatever rigor I have within me. But the crumbling nature of thinking's awareness of itself and especially the certainty of <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>thinking reaching its end only in failing</span></span>, hinder any repose and prevent the relaxed state that facilitates a rigorous disposition of things. Committed to the casual stance--<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>I think</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and express myself </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>in the free play of hazard</span></span>. Obviously, everyone in some way admits the importance of hazard. But this recognition is as minimal and unconscious as possible. <span class='card-underline'>Going my way unconstrained, unhampered, I develop my thoughts, make choices with regard to expression--but I don't have the control over myself that I want. And the actual dynamic of my intelligence is equally uncontrollable</span>. So that I owe to other dynamics--to lucky chance and to fleeting moments of relaxation--the minimal order and relative learning that I do have. And the rest of the time . . . Thus, as <span class='card-underline'>I see it </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>my thought proceeds in harmony with its object</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, an object that it attains more and perfectly the greater the state of its own ruin. Though it isn't necessarily conscious of this. At one and the same time </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>my thinking must reach plenary illumination and dissolution</span></span><span class='card-underline'> . . . In the same individual, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>thought must construct and destroy itself</span></span>. And even that isn't quite right. Even the most rigorous thinkers yield to chance. In addition, the demands inherent in the exercise of thought often take me far from where I started. One of the great difficulties encountered by understanding is to put order into thought's interrelations in time. In a given moment, my thought reaches considerable rigor. But how to link it with yesterday's thinking? Yesterday, in a sense, I was another person, responding to other worries. Adapting one to the other remains possible, but . . . This insufficiency bothers me no more than the insufficiency relating to the many woes of the human condition generally. Humanness is related in us to nonsatisfaction, a nonsatisfaction to which we yield without accepting it, though; we distance ourselves from humanness when we regard ourselves as satisfied or when we give up searching for satisfaction. Sartre is right in relation to me to recall the myth of Sisyphus, though "in relation to me" here equates to "in relation to humanity," I suppose. What can be expected of us is to go as far as possible and not to stop. What by contrast, humanly speaking, can be criticized are endeavors whose only meaning is some relation to moments of completion. Is it possible for me to go further? I won't wait to coordinate my efforts in that case--I'll go further. I'll take the risk. And the reader, free not to venture after me, will often take advantage of that same freedom! The critics are right to scent danger here! But let me in turn point out a greater danger, one that comes from methods that, adequate only to an outcome of knowledge, confer on individuals whom they limit a sheerly fragmentary existence--an existence that is mutilated with respect to the whole that remains inaccessible. Having recognized this, I'll defend my position. I've spoken of inner experience: my intention was to make known an object. But by proposing this vague title, I didn't want to confine myself sheerly to inner facts of that experience. It's an arbitrary procedure to reduce knowledge to what we get from our intuitions as subjects. This is something only a newborn can do. And we ourselves (who write) can only know something about this newborn by observing it from outside (the child is only our object). A separation experience, related to a vital continuum (our conception and our birth) and to a return to that continuum (in our first sexual feelings and our first laughter), leaves us without any clear recollections, and only in objective operations do we reach the core of the being we are. A phenomenology of the developed mind assumes a coincidence of subjective and objective aspects and at the same time a fusion of subject and object. * [This is the fundamental requirement of Hegel's phenomenology. Clearly, instead of responding to it, modern phenomenology, while replying to changing human thought, is only one moment among others: a sandcastle, a mirage of sorts.] This means an isolated operation is admissible only because of fatigue (so, the explanation I gave of laughter, because I was unable to develop a whole movement in tandem with a conjugation of the modalities of laughter would be left suspended--since every theory of laughter is integrally a philosophy and, similarly, every integral philosophy is a theory of laughter . . .). But that is the point--though I set forth these principles, at the same time I must renounce following them. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Thought is produced</span></span><span class='card-underline'> in me </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>as uncoordinated flashes</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, withdrawing endlessly from a term to which its movement pushes it</span>. I can't tell if I'm expressing human helplessness this way, or my own . . . I don't know, though I'm not hopeful of even some outwardly satisfying outcome. Isn't there an advantage in creating philosophy as I do? A flash in the night--a language belonging to a brief moment . . . Perhaps in this respect this latest moment contains a simple truth. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>In order to will knowledge</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, by an indirect expedient </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>I tend to become the whole universe</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. But </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>in this movement I can't be a whole human being</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, since I submit to a particular goal, becoming the whole. Granted, if I could become it, I would thus be a whole human being. But in my effort, don't I distance myself from exactly that? And </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>how can I become the whole without becoming a whole human being? </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>I can't be this whole human being except when I let go</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. I can't be this through willpower: my will necessarily has to will outcomes! But if misfortune (or chance) wills me to let go, then I know I am an integral, whole humanness, subordinate to nothing</span>. In other words, <span class='card-underline'>the moment of revolt inherent in willing a knowledge beyond practical ends can't be indefinitely continued. And </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>in order to be the whole universe, humankind has to let go and abandon its principle</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, accepting as the sole criterion of what it is the tendency to go beyond what it is</span>. This existence that I am is a revolt against existence and is indefinite desire. For this existence God was simply a stage and now here he is, looming large, grown from unfathomable experience, comically perched on the stake used for impalement. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>My method has confusion as a consequence</span></span><span class='card-underline'>--and in the long run </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>this confusion is unbearable</span></span> (particularly for me!).

Beyond its defined limits</span></span><span class='card-underline'>--in time and in space--</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>this existence or being no longer exists</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, no longer is.

He <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>[they] recognize</span></span>s <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>that</span></span> he <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>[they] cannot fulfill</span></span> his <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>[their] life without surrendering to an inexorable movement</span></span>, whose violence he can feel acting on the most remote areas of his being with a rigor that frightens him. If he turns to other beings who do not go beyond beatitude, he experiences no hate, but, on the contrary, he sympathizes with necessary pleasures; he clashes only with those who pretend to attain fulfillment in their lives, who act out a risk-free charade in order to be recognized as having attained fulfillment, while in fact they only speak of fulfillment. But he should not succumb to vertigo. For <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>vertigo</span></span><span class='card-underline'> swiftly exhausts and </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>threatens to revive a concern for happy leisure</span></span><span class='card-underline'> or, if that cannot be attained, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>for a painless emptiness</span></span>. Or <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>if</span></span> he <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>[they] do</span></span>es <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>not give in, and if</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>he <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>[they] tear</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>him<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>[them]self</span></span><span class='card-underline'> completely </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>apart</span></span><span class='card-underline'> in terrified haste,</span> he <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>[they] enter</span></span>s <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>death in such a way that nothing is more horrible</span></span>. He alone is happy who, having experienced vertigo to the point of trembling in his bones, to the point of being incapable of measuring the extent of his fall, suddenly finds the unhoped-for strength to turn his agony into a joy capable of freezing and transfiguring those who meet it. But the only ambition that can take hold of a man who, in cold blood, sees his life fulfilled in rending agony, cannot aspire to a grandeur that only extreme chance has at its disposal. This kind of violent decision, which disrupts his repose, does not necessarily entail either his vertigo or his fall in sudden death. In him, this decision may become an act and a power by which he devotes himself to the rigor whose movement ceaselessly closes in on him, as cutting as the beak of a bird of prey. Contemplation is only the context, sometimes calm and sometimes stormy, in which the rapid force of his action must one day be put to the test. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The mystical existence of</span></span><span class='card-underline'> the one whose </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>"joy before death" has become inner violence</span></span><span class='card-underline'> can never attain the satisfying beatitude of the Christian who gives himself a foretaste of eternity. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The mystic of "joy before death" can never be seen as cornered, for</span></span> he is <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>[they are] able to laugh</span></span><span class='card-underline'> complacently </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>at every human endeavor and to know every accessible enthusiasm</span></span><span class='card-underline'>: but </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the totality of life</span></span><span class='card-underline'>—ecstatic contemplation and lucid knowledge accomplished in a single action that cannot fail to become risk—</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, however, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>just as inexorably</span></span> his <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>[their] lot as death is that of the condemned</span></span> man<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>[person]</span></span>. The texts that follow cannot alone constitute an initiation into the exercise of a mysticism of "joy before death." While admitting that a method of initiation might exist, they do not represent even a part of it. <span class='card-underline'>Since </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>oral initiation is</span></span><span class='card-underline'> itself </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>difficult, it is </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>impossible</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> to give</span></span><span class='card-underline'> in a few pages </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>more than the vaguest representation</span></span><span class='card-underline'> of that which by nature cannot be grasped</span>. On the whole, these writings represent, moreover, less exercises strictly speaking than simple descriptions of a contemplative state or of an ecstatic contemplation. These descriptions would not even be acceptable if they were not given for what they are, in other words, as free. Only the very first text could be proposed as an exercise. While it is appropriate to use the word mysticism when speaking of "joy before death" and its practice, this implies no more than an affective resemblance between this practice and those of the religions of Asia or Europe. There is no reason to link any presuppositions concerning an alleged deeper reality with a joy that has no object other than immediate life. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>"Joy before death" belongs only to the person for whom there is no beyond</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>; it is the only intellectually honest route in the search for ecstasy</span></span>. Besides, <span class='card-underline'>how could a beyond, a God or what resembles God, still be acceptable?</span> No words are clear enough to express the happy disdain of the one who "dances with the time that kills him" for those who take refuge in the expectation of eternal beatitude. This kind of fretful saintliness—which first had to he sheltered from erotic excess—has now lost all its power: one can only laugh at a sacred drunkenness allied with a horror of debauchery. Prudery may be healthy for backward souls, but those who would be afraid of nude girls or whisky would have little to do with "joy before death." Only a shameless, indecent saintliness can lead to a sufficiently happy loss of self. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>"Joy before death" means that life can be glorified from root to summit. It robs of meaning everything that is an intellectual or moral beyond</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, substance, God, immutable order, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>or salvation</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>. It is an apotheosis of that which is perishable, apotheosis of flesh</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and alcohol as well as of the trances of mysticism.</span> The religious forms it rediscovers are the naive forms that antedate the intrusion of a servile morality: <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>it renews the</span></span><span class='card-underline'> kind of </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>tragic jubilation that man "is" as soon as he stops behaving [weakly]</span></span>like a cripple, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>glorifying</span></span><span class='card-underline'> necessary </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>work and letting himself be emasculated by the fear of tomorrow.</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span></p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Death is the most luxurious form of life.

It calls for us to despise the link associating death with erotIcIsm, regarded as a promise of life. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>It is easy, but</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, all in all, it is </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>dishonourable</span></span><span class='card-underline'> (a lack of intellectual virility) to </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>turn away from the luxurious truth of death</span></span><span class='card-underline'>: there is no doubt that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>death is the youth of the world</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. We don't admit this, we don't want to admit it, for a rather sad reason: we are perhaps young at heart, but </span><span class='card-underline'>this doesn't mean we are more alert</span><span class='card-underline'>. Otherwise, how could we not be aware that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>death, and death alone, constantly ensures the renewal of life</span></span>?≥ The worst is that, in a sense, we know this very well, but we are just as quick to forget it. The law given in nature is so simple as to defy ignorance. According to this law, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>life is effusion</span></span><span class='card-underline'>; it is contrary to equilibrium, to stability. It is the tumultuous movement that bursts forth and consumes itself. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Its perpetual explosion is possible on one condition: </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>that the spent organisms give way to new ones</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, which enter the dance with new forces.</span>2 We could really not imagine a more costly process. Life is possible at much less expense: compared to that of an infusorian, the individual organism of a mammal, especially a carnivore, is an abyss where enormous quantities of energy are swallowed up, are destroyed. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The growth of plants presupposes the amassing of decayed substances</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. Plant-eaters consume tons of living (plant) substance before a small amount of meat allows a carnivore its great releases, its great nervous expenditures</span>. It even appears that the more costly the life-generating processes are, the more squander the production of organisms has required, the more satisfactory the operation is. <span class='card-underline'>The principle of producing at the least expense is not so much a human idea as a narrowly capitalist one</span> (it makes sense only from the viewpoint of the incorporated company). <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The movement of human life</span></span><span class='card-underline'> even </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>tends toward anguish, as the sign of expenditures that are finally excessive</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, that go beyond what we can bear. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Everything within us demands that death lay waste to us</span></span><span class='card-underline'>: we anticipate these multiple trials, these new beginnings, unproductive from the standpoint of reason, this wholesale destruction of effective force accomplished in the transfer of one individual's life to other, younger, individuals</span>. Deep down, we even assent to the condition that results, that is almost intolerable, in this condition of individuals destined for suffering and inevitable annihilation. Or rather, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>were it not for this intolerable condition</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, so harsh that the will constantly wavers, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>we would not be satisfied</span></span>. (How significant at present that a book3 is entitled, ludicrously, Afin que nul ne meure!...) Today our judgements are formed in disappointing circumstances: <span class='card-underline'>those among us who best make themselves heard are unaware (and want at all cost to be unaware) that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>life is the luxury of which death is the highest degree</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, that of all the luxuries of life, human life is the most extravagantly expensive, that, finally, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>an increased apprehension of death</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, when life's security wears thin, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is at the highest level of ruinous refinement</span></span> ...

(1988–91, 2:218) <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The reduction of our lives to the order of utility forces us to project ourselves endlessly into the future</span></span>. Bataille writes of this as our anguished state, caused by this anticipation “that must be called anticipation of oneself. For he must apprehend himself in the future, through the anticipated results of his action” (1988–91, 2:218). <span class='card-underline'>This is why advanced capitalism and </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>phallicized whiteness must ground themselves in a denial of death: death precludes the arrival of this future</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. It cuts us off from ourselves, severing us from the future self that is always our real and true self.</span> Resisting the existential turn, however, Bataille refuses to read this denial of death as an ontological condition of humanity. For Bataille, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>this is a historical</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and economic </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>denial, </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>one in which only a culture grounded in the anticipation of the future must participate</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. He frames it primarily as a problem of the intellect. In the reduction of the world to the order of utility, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>we have reduced our lives</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and experiences </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>to the order of instrumental reason</span></span>. This order necessarily operates in a sequential temporality, facing forward toward the time when the results will be achieved, the questions solved, the theorems proved—and also when political domination will be ended and ethical an- guish quieted. As Bataille credits Hegel for seeing, “knowledge is never given to us except by unfolding in time” (1988–91, 2:202). It never appears to us except, finally, “as the result of a calculated effort, an operation useful to some end” (1988–91, 2:202)—and its utility, as we have seen, only drives it forward toward some future utility, endlessly. There are always new and future objects of thought to conquer and domesticate. Within this order of reason, death presents the cessation of the very practice of knowledge itself.<span class='card-underline'> Severing us from the future objects of thought and from our future selves, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>“death prevents man from attaining himself”</span></span> (1988–91, 2:218). As Bataille explains, “the fear of death appears linked from the start to the projection of oneself into a future time, which [is] an effect of the positing of oneself as a thing” (1988–91, 2:218). <span class='card-underline'>The </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>fear of death derives from </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the subordination to the order of utility and</span></span><span class='card-underline'> its dominant form of the intellect, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>instrumental reason</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> While death is unarguably a part of the human condition, for Bataille <span class='card-underline'>the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>fear of death</span></span><span class='card-underline'> is a historically habituated response, one that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>grounds cultures of</span></span><span class='card-underline'> advanced capitalism and </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>phallicized whiteness</span></span>. In those frames of late modernity, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>death introduces an ontological scarcity into the very human condition: it represents</span></span><span class='card-underline'> finitude, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the ultimate limit</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>. We must distance ourselves from such threats, and we do so</span></span><span class='card-underline'> most often </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>by </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>projecting them onto sexualized, racialized, and classed bodies</span></span>. But for Bataille, <span class='card-underline'>se</span><span class='card-underline'>rvility to the order of knowledge is as unnecessary as servility to the order of utility. To die humanly, he argues, is to accept “the subordination of the thing”</span> (1988– 91, 2:219), which places us in the schema that separates our present self from the future, desired, anticipated self: “to die humanly is to have of the future being, of the one who matters most in our eyes, the senseless idea that he is not” (1988–91, 2:219). But if we are not trapped in the endless anticipation of our future self as the index of meaning in our lives, we may not be anguished by this cessation: “<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>If we live sovereignly, the </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>representation of death is impossible</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, for the present is not subject to the demands of the future</span>” (1988–91, 2:219). <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>To live sovereignly is not to escape death,</span></span><span class='card-underline'> which is ontologically impossible. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>But</span></span><span class='card-underline'> it is </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>to refuse the fear</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, and subsequent attempts at disavowal, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>of death</span></span> as the ontological condition that defines humanity. Rather than trying to transgress this ultimate limit and prohibition, <span class='card-underline'>the sovereign</span> man <span class='card-underline'>[person] “cannot die fleeing</span>. He <span class='card-underline'>[they] cannot let the threat of death deliver</span> him <span class='card-underline'>[them] over to the horror of a desperate yet impossible flight”</span> (1988–91, 2:219). <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Living in a temporal mode in which </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>“anticipation would dissolve into NOTHING”</span></span> (1988–91, 2: 208), <span class='card-underline'>the sovereign</span> man <span class='card-underline'>[person] “lives and dies like an animal”</span> (1988–91, 2:219).

His orientation toward general economies asks us to think differently from the habituated patterns of our historical present. In his language, this historical present is “characterized by the fact that judgments concerning the general situation proceed from a particular point of view” (1988– 91, 1:39). This particularity can be outlined, described, pinned down, and its blind spots excavated: I attempt to do so in this text. But to think generally from and about the historical present may lead us into different questions and different orientations: it has led me to query systems of domination through the registers of temporality and spatiality, while framing them through the identity categories (race, gender, sexuality, class, religion) that are their most explicit historical tools. <span class='card-underline'>For example, how does </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the temporality of a persistent future orientation ground systems of racism, sexism, and heterosexism</span></span><span class='card-underline'>? What assumptions about the ontology of space allow for the biological conception of race that groundsracism, or of sex that grounds sexism and heterosexism? Bataille warns us that, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>if we do not learn to think in this counter-cultural register</span></span><span class='card-underline'> of general economy</span><span class='card-underline'>, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>we will always be subordinated to</span></span><span class='card-underline'> the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>violent and</span></span><span class='card-underline'> even </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>catastrophic expressions</span></span><span class='card-underline'> of the excess, abundant energy of the planet, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>such as war and imperialist domination.</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>We do have a choice in this matter.

The cruelties of the Second World War did nothing to alter the underlying situation of death: the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>lines at the gates of Hell are only getting longer.</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> Death by fire</span></span>, in whatever form, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>was</span></span><span class='card-underline'> in Bataille’s eyes </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>unremarkable</span></span>, for “each fire is all fires.” <span class='card-underline'>What so moved Bataille about atomic bombs and the idea of nuclear war</span>, contra Anders, <span class='card-underline'>was not escalating thresholds of death</span> (individual, collective, the end of a world shaped by humanity) and he disdained moralistic critiques, especially those based on a concern for the suffering of others. For Bataille, <span class='card-underline'>what </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the nuclear bomb revealed</span></span><span class='card-underline'> was </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>dark truth</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> of human destiny</span></span><span class='card-underline'>—not what we have since become due to a twist of fate but </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>what we were from the very start</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, though we could not see it.</span> Over a decade after his review of Hiroshima, revising his earlier interpretation of Hiroshima's bombing being more of the same, he wrote in another article titled, “Unlivable Earth,” that We know that we cannot attain this world without denying, without suppressing what we are. But in catching sight of it, we are led to forget its real takes on a human meaning. Otherwise, it would merely have the animal meaning of smoking out termites.” Ibid, 226-7. 144 spirit, its horrible tribal wars, its tortures, its massacres; or, in a less primitive civilization, the reduction of an unfortunate group of conquered men to slavery, men transported by force, under the lash, toward unspeakable markets. Only by dint of grievous lies can we conceal the accursed truth of history. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>There is something frightful in human destiny</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, which undoubtedly was always at the limit of this unlimited nightmare that the most modern weaponry, the nuclear bomb, finally announces</span>.165 And later in the same piece: The first men, as well as some very primitive savages today, think they are really animals: because animals are, in their mind, the most holy, having a sacred quality, which men have lost. Thus, according to the simplest among us, animals, not men, are gods: animals alone have retained these supernatural qualities, which men have lost. Of course it is hard for us to think that we are becoming completely wretched! And yet . . . <span class='card-underline'>we might have a sublime idea of the animal now that we have ceased being certain that one day the nuclear bomb will not make the planet an unlivable place for man.166 </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The deep truth of nuclear war is that it announces the revelation of our </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>lost animality</span></span>. By contextualizing the atomic bomb in this way, Bataille was not (in the vein of someone like Churchill) attempting to diminish the significance of atomic bombs. To the contrary, driven by “the will to create a force, starting from an awareness of the misery and the grandeur of this perishable existence that has befallen us,” Bataille once 165 Bataille, Cradle of Humanity, 176. 166 Ibid, 178. 145 proclaimed: “<span class='card-underline'>STANDING AND FACING DESTINY remains in my eyes the essential aspect of knowledge.”</span>167 For him, <span class='card-underline'>the nuclear bomb did not reveal a new situation</span>, as Anders believed, <span class='card-underline'>so much as it represented the real of an old situation that seemed preoccupied with continuity but was suicidal from the start</span>. According <span class='card-underline'>to Bataille, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the nuclear epoch did not threaten humanity so much as </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>it was indistinguishable from humanity</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>. Nuclear war would constitute an infernal return of an animal indifference to death—</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the sacred core of humanity's origins</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span></p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Our act of transgressive eroticism allows for the rawest form of communication – the act of violent unproductivity create continuous acts of shared inner experience</div><div class='cite'>Botting and Wilson 97 (Fred Botting and Scott Wilson, “The Bataille Reader”, 1997 ///ghs-sc)</div><div class='card-body'><p>For Bataille, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>it is</span></span><span class='card-underline'> 'the identity of</span> these <span class='card-underline'>perfect contraries, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>divine ecstasy and</span></span><span class='card-underline'> its opposite, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>extreme horror' that blows identity apart</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, unleashes experience from the 'prison' of anguish </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>and establishes continuity with alterity: communication</span></span>. This statement comes as the 'inevitable conclusion to a history of eroticism'. It is with eroticism that 'the contraries seem visibly conjoined, where the religious horror disclosed in sacrifice becomes linked to the abyss of eroticism'. 21 Two texts written in 1941 exemplify the link between horror and eroticism. 'The torment' from Inner Experience, already cited, is the companion to another text written in a different register, though one concerned, essentially, with the same experience. 'I wrote this slim volume in September and October 1941, just before 'Le Supplice' ['The torment'], which makes up the second part of L'Experience interieure. To my mind the two texts are closely interdependent and one cannot be understood without the other . . . I could not have written 'Le Supplice' if I had not first provided its lewd key.'22 Madame Edwarda has been called by Maurice Blanchot, one of the first persons to read it during the worst days of the Occupation in 1941/3 'the most beautiful narrative of our time'.24 <span class='card-underline'>This narrative, like 'The torment', makes the atheological connection between inner experience and eroticism in a horrifyingly literal way</span>:¶ She was seated, she held one long leg stuck up in the air, to open her crack yet wider she used her fingers to draw the folds of skin apart ... 'Why', I stammered in a subdued tone, 'why are you doing that?' 'You can see for yourself ', she said, 'I'm GOD'. (p. 229)¶ <span class='card-underline'>As an account of a visit to a brothel, the story is quite banal. The intensity of the experience, however, invests the encounter with the mystico-philosophical significance of 'eroticism'</span>, reversing the veiled pornographic flickerings of erotica. The difference Bataille suggests, in his Preface on the intentions of 'Pierre Angelique', pseudonymous author of MadameEdwarda, lies in the unusual 'gravity' with which the matter of sexual life is treated, as opposed to the customary 'making light' of it (p. 223). <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>In eroticism the object of desire radiates with a nocturnal brilliance</span></span><span class='card-underline'> that reduces the subject to nothing but the infinite movement of desire itself. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>In the ecstatic movement beyond individual experience, a movement of consumption by an unattainable</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, impossible </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>object of desire</span></span>, the hero, as religious ingenu, comes to understand <span class='card-underline'>the truth of Madame Edwarda's revelation: she is God, but 'GOD figured as a public whore</span> and gone crazy - that, viewed through the optic of "philosophy", makes no sense at all' (p. 233). The non-sense of the un-knowing that manifests itself in poetic intoxication, laughter's expenditure, or ecstasy's flight, also drives eroti­ cism, dissociating it from the impulses of natural animality or sexuality. <span class='card-underline'>'Eroticism, unlike simple sexual activity is a psychological quest independent of the natural goal</span>.,25 <span class='card-underline'>Located in a psychological or psychoanalytical domain, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>eroticism constitutes one of those experiences in which the fundamental form of the human is brought into question</span></span>.¶ For Bataille, it is woman that occupies the place where the object of desire exceeds both objectivity and subjectivity with a glimpse of an unknown infinity. That this is so is no doubt an effect of a particular cultural conjuncture: 'a new representation of woman was emerging at the center of the intellectual epic of the interwar years', Elisabeth Roudinesco argues. This representation, for the surrealists, took the shape of the female crimi­ nal. For psychoanalysis it was the 'female ecstatic' (as represented in Bernini's statue of the Ecstasy ofSaint Teresa), culminating with Madame Edwarda herself, 'a triumphant madwoman, capable of inscribing the name of God on the "rags" hanging from her scarlet sex'.26 Woman, in godless modernity, assumes the intermediary function of a discredited priesthood, the impossible object between finite being and infinity that guarantees sacred excess. Woman's proximity to the divine is manifested in her jouissance.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>The notion of debate as a tool to achieve their standards is emblematic of the will to productivity and is exactly what we’re critiquing</div><div class='cite'>Brewer 13 (Ben Brewer is a Graduate Student of Philosophy at Emory University, “Unsaying Non-Knowledge: Georges Bataille and the Mysticism of Writing,” 2013 ///ghs-sc)</div><div class='card-body'><p>Though the critiques of project and rationality follow similar structures and are equiprimordial, it is easiest to begin with the critique of utility. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>According to utility, an object must have</span></span><span class='card-underline'> reference to </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>some external end</span></span><span class='card-underline'> in order to be considered meaningful</span>. In this mode of being-in-the-world, the tool is the primary example of meaning. Importantly, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the tool “has no value in itself” and is only meaningful “in relation to an anticipated result”</span></span> (Theory of Religion 28). While the truth of the tool lies in its usefulness towards a given end, the end is itself also grounded in utility. The tools of agriculture, to use Bataille’s example from Theory of Religion, are defined in terms of their usefulness to the cultivation of crops: a plow is only a plow so long as it accomplishes the goal of preparing soil for planting. The resulting food is, in turn, only valuable to the end of being eaten, which is only valuable in terms of its ability to sustain human life, which is only valuable in its ability to do work, etc. The absurdity of this “endless deferral” is matched by the equal absurdity of “a true end, which would serve no purpose” (29). Either utility continues indefinitely such that no individual thing is valuable in itself, or the utility is grounded in something which is not itself useful. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>A “true end,” must be something with no use-value</span></span> at all. <span class='card-underline'>This is true for two reasons. The first is</span> clearly explicit in my preceding explanation: <span class='card-underline'>there must be something at the end of the line</span>, so to speak, <span class='card-underline'>which grounds meaning</span>. This is a purely logical objection. <span class='card-underline'>Meaning based in utility makes impossible the very thing it purports to offer: grounded meaning.</span> <span class='card-underline'>The second</span> necessity <span class='card-underline'>deals</span> instead <span class='card-underline'>with Bataille’s ethical commitment to immanent subjectivity: “What a ‘true end’ reintroduces is the continuous being, lost in the world like water is lost in water”</span> (29). The structure of <span class='card-underline'>the tool introduces a break into the continuity of animal experiencing. In order for me to use something as a tool, it must first be distinct from me. Once it is distinct from me, I am no longer in an immanent state of continuity with my world. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The introduction of discontinuity into</span></span><span class='card-underline'> the indiscriminate immanence of </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>existence is the condition of the possibility of a tool. To use a tool</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, therefore, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is already to be in the realm of project</span></span>.3 <span class='card-underline'>Bataille then introduces the dimension of temporality to the critique of utility in order to critique what he calls “project,”</span> though it could easily be referred to as desire. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Project denotes a mode of being-in-the-world in which time itself is experienced as an object to be enlisted in the favor of utility</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. The present becomes meaningful only insofar as its occurrences are useful in relation to the accomplishment of a (future) goal.</span> The critique of this mode of being-in-the-world runs similarly to the critique of utility. <span class='card-underline'>First of all, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>I will never be fulfilled</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. This is the basic problem of desire or projection: desire is constituted on a lack. I can only desire something I do not have</span>. More importantly, it will not actually fulfill my desire; my desire, instead, will simply reconstitute itself with a new object-cause, which will be equally unsatisfactory upon its acquisition. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The infinite regress of utility-based meaning manifests itself here as the impossibility of satisfying desire. The</span></span><span class='card-underline'> ethical </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>problem of discontinuity</span></span>, however, also <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>reappears with the introduction of temporality</span></span>. Right after the above-quoted passage about animality, Bataille also notes that the goshawk eating the hen exists in a way “in which nothing is given in time…in which nothing is given beyond the present” (18). For Bataille, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the</span></span><span class='card-underline'> very </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>division of time</span></span><span class='card-underline'> into past, present, and future </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>introduces discontinuity</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and transcendence </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>into the continuous oneness of immanence. This discontinuity is</span></span>, for Bataille, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the underlying problem of utility</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>as well. <span class='card-underline'>The idea of </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>discontinuity</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, either between subject and object or among past, present, and future, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is the condition of the possibility of utility’s emergence</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. Nick Land explains, “Bataille’s thought of </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>discontinuity</span></span><span class='card-underline'> is more intricate than his fluent deployment of the word might indicate. It </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is the condition for transcendent illusion</span></span><span class='card-underline'>”</span> (Land 64). <span class='card-underline'>In this way the same critique of deferral applies to discontinuity: “Discontinuity is not ontologically grounded but positively fabricated”</span> (64). <span class='card-underline'>The groundlessness of discontinuity is not,</span> then, <span class='card-underline'>accidental to the groundlessness of deferral, but rather constitutive of it. </span>Finally, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Bataille applies the critiques of utility</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and project </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>to the practice of discursive reason</span></span>. Broadly speaking, <span class='card-underline'>discursive reason is the practice of philosophy understood as explanation. Insofar as </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>discursive reasoning</span></span><span class='card-underline'> always occurs within the context of elucidating something for a higher end, usually “truth,” it </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is based in project and utility</span></span>. In contradistinction to this approach to philosophy, Bataille poses “sovereign nonknowledge”—a way of philosophizing that does not attempt to elucidate transcendent truths, but rather forces the reader into an experience (“Nonknowledge” 196). <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Discursive reason also rests on the distinction between subject and object</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. In order to define something for explication or exploration, one must first delimit it from the manifold. I cannot give an account of what a chair is without first designating that a chair is some object distinct from all other possible objects in the world.</span> This ontological problem of discursive reason points to the role that language plays in Bataille’s thought. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Language rests on this</span></span><span class='card-underline'> same </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>dividing up of the world</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. It rests on the ability to define a subject as distinct from an object. Even if I proclaim that I am thinking about myself, syntax necessitates that there is an “I” who is thinking (subject) and an “I” which is being thought about (object). This structural necessity is,</span> for Bataille, “<span class='card-underline'>one of the most fateful aberrations of language”</span> (Theory of Religion 28). <span class='card-underline'>Bataille’s non-knowledge, then, cannot simply be expressed in discursive language. Instead Bataille engages what Michael Sells calls “unsaying,” </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>perverting and twisting language against itself in order to “engage the ineffable”</span></span> (Sells 3). In these critiques <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Bataille attempts to elucidate and undermine the very basis of transcendent subjectivity—discontinuity. The calling into question of the structure of discontinuity, between subject and world, between I and thou, undergirds all of Bataille’s thought.</span></span></p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Solves all your biz</div><div class='cite'>-about poetry in general, but more explicitly about the poem that’s the discontinuity alt so you should probably read this with that</div><div class='card-body'><p>Bataille 57 (Georges Bataille, crazy librarian, “L'Erotisme,” or “Erotism: Death and Sensuality,” originally published in 1957 ///ghs-sc)</p><p>I spoke of mystical experience, not of poetry.

For Trungpa, the sun is a symbol of basic goodness, and the human capacity to awaken to it, to become enlightened. For Bataille, the sun is the material starting point for earthly life, and thus his phi- losophy. <span class='card-underline'>“</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Solar energy</span></span><span class='card-underline'>,” writes Bataille, “</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is the source of life’s exuberant development</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. The origin and essence of our wealth are given in the radiation of the sun, which dispenses energy—wealth—without any return.”65 The sun offers our planet enough energy in one hour to meet contemporary civilizational needs for an entire year</span>.66 Harnessing this energy, to be sure, is a massive technological challenge. Moreover, biological life only has limited access to the superabundance of solar energy that hits the planet every day. But the amount of energy we can access enables an energetically rich life. <span class='card-underline'>Bataille’s materialist analysis of solar lavishness helpfully concretizes Trungpa’s account of basic goodness, what he also referred to as “basic richness.”</span>67 While Trungpa o ers practices for people to feel their inherent goodness and richness, actually experiencing this goodness takes time.68 Without spending hours meditating, and slowly uncovering a tender and radiating heart, Trungpa’s teachings on basic goodness and richness can appear ideal- istic. <span class='card-underline'>Bataille’s materialist account of solar generosity further evidences Trungpa’s philosophy; it offers strong conceptual proof that can heighten commitment to the experiential practice of meditation. “ </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The sun gives without ever receiving</span></span><span class='card-underline'>,” argues Bataille. </span>“[Humans] were conscious of this long before astrophysics measured that ceaseless prodigality; they saw it ripen the harvests and they associated its splen- dor with the act of someone who gives without receiving.”69At a basic biological level, the sun’s exuberance means that “on the surface of the globe, for living matter in general, energy is always in excess, the ques- tion is always posed in terms of extravagance.”70 Put more succinctly: “<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>We receive more energy than we can use</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.”</span>71 e basic planetary con- dition is wealth more than poverty. <span class='card-underline'>The essential meaning of Bataille’s claim that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>luxury</span></span><span class='card-underline'>—not necessity—</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>organizes life on earth</span></span><span class='card-underline'> is that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>all organisms have access to more energy than required</span></span><span class='card-underline'> for subsistence, thanks to the sun’s exuberance</span><span class='card-underline'>, is </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>excess is often invested in biological growth</span></span><span class='card-underline'> (at the level of an organism, species, or ecosystem).

Similarly, consider the capacity for pleasure su using animal life, espe- cially all the sexualized pleasures apparently unrelated to procreation. Even when a sensory pleasure is associated with basic functioning like a good sneeze, excretion, or stretch, there can still be sumptuousness to the sensation (need it feel so good?). A sneeze is arguably basic good- ness at work, a ash of solar exuberance amidst our everyday lives. Consider, also, the ubiquity of queerness across the animal king- dom. According to Bruce Bagemihl, author of Biological Exuberance (a book that draws heavily from Bataille), “homosexuality is found in virtually all animal groups, in virtually all geographic areas and time periods, and in a wide variety of forms.”73 But why, asks Bagemihl, “does same-sex activity persist—reappearing in species after species, generation after generation, individual after individual—when it is not useful” from a strictly evolutionary perspective?74 Bagemihl’s answer is that use and necessity are not life’s sole organizing principles: “Natural systems are driven as much by abundance and excess as they are by limitation and practicality. Seen in this light, homosexuality and non- reproductive heterosexuality are ‘expected’ occurrences—they are one manifestation of an overall ‘extravagance’ of biological systems that has many expressions.”75 <span class='card-underline'>For Bataille, our primordial condition is marked by richness thanks to the lavishness of the sun. And then, of course, we die. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Death can easily appear as proof of our ultimate poverty</span></span><span class='card-underline'>; it seemingly mocks attempts to assert the basic richness or goodness of life.

We lie to ourselves when we dream of escaping the movement of luxurious exuberance of which we are only the most intense form.”76 </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Death’s energetic squandering is</span></span><span class='card-underline'> also </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>an ecological gift</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> for</span></span><span class='card-underline'> the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>new life</span></span><span class='card-underline'> arising from decay: </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>“[Humankind] conspires to ignore the fact that </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>death is also the youth of things</span></span>.”77 Bataille’s reading of death as exemplary of basic goodness supports Trungpa’s encouragement to <span class='card-underline'>“</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>make friends with our death</span></span><span class='card-underline'>,” and to not resentfully cast it as “a defeat and as an insult.”78 Tibetan culture, according to Bataille, is more successful than Euro-American ones at affirming the totality of life.</span> For Bataille, cultur- al forms that communicate this a rmation are glorious expenditures of basic energetic wealth. e resentment that animates so many Eu- ro-American cultural forms is itself enabled by energetic exuberance, a “catastrophic” use of our basic richness.79 And the Euro-American desire to escape our corporeality only intensi es feelings of lack and malaise by disconnecting us from the earthly exuberance alive in our changeful bodies. For Bataille: <span class='card-underline'>Anguish arises when the anxious individual is not himself stretched tight by the feeling of superabundance</span>. is is precisely what evinces the isolated, individual character of anguish. ere can be anguish only from a personal, par- ticular point of view that is radically opposed to the general point of view based on the exuberance of living matter as a whole. Anguish is meaningless for someone who over ows with life, and for life as a whole, which is an over owing by its very nature.80 Energetic poverty and lack are realities for life on earth. But they are always felt by particular beings at particular times; energetic lack is not our general or basic condition. And yet the more we separate ourselves from exuberant life energies in attempts to gain dominion over them, the more liable we are to experience lack; we progressively remove our- selves from nature’s over ow. Bataille was interested in nurturing a sovereign—rather than ser- vile—human encounter with existence: “ e sovereignty I speak of has little to do with the sovereignty of states... I speak in general of an aspect that is opposed to the servile and the subordinate.”81 Viewing humans as agents of life’s exuberance, Bataille saw sovereignty as hu- manity’s “primordial condition.”82 <span class='card-underline'>We are regal and rich from birth.

Bataille's notion of <span class='card-underline'>death is</span> an empty version of Hegel's: it is <span class='card-underline'>negativity, but one that cannot be recuperated</span>, even if all our actions can be seen as attempts at such a recuperation. <span class='card-underline'>Death is the loss that defines our existence as individuals, since sexual reproduction is absolutely caught up with the death of the individual</span>; unlike amoebae, there is no continuity of Being from one organism to the next (The Accursed Share, 32; OC VII, 39. See also Eroticism, 12-15; OCX, 17-21). Death, then, is as much part of the inherent wastefulness in nature as life. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Death seems</span></span><span class='card-underline'> to us like </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the most wasteful form</span></span>, but for Bataille, such a conception is to be left behind (not ignored or overcome): 'the luxury of death is regarded by us in the same way as that of sexuality, first as a negation of ourselves, then - in a sudden reversal - as the profound truth of that movement of which life is the manifestation (The Accursed Share, 34-5; OC VII, 41). Is death then in some way the truth of Bataille's system? At points it recalls Heidegger's notion of 'Being toward death', but as with many of Bataille's notions, the whole issue of centrality is open to question even as it is posed. Bataille argues that it will always be possible to show that whichever primordial fact gets priority presuppose s the existence of anothe r one (The Accursed Share, vol. II, 82; OC VIII, 71). 1 Death features in early writings - 'beings only die to be born', 'Solar Anus', 7; OC I, 84), and become s something that does not transcend the individual so much as lose the individual in a generalized excess. Instead of Hegel's mastery of death, <span class='card-underline'>we see that in the fact that life and death are passionately devoted to the subsidence of the void, the relation of master/slave subordination is no longer revealed, but life and void are confused and mingled like lovers, in the convulsive moments of the end. </span>('Sacrifices', 133; OC I, 93 trans, mod.) <span class='card-underline'>Instead of giving in to death, accepting it at a distance, as the distancing that structure s Being (Heidegger), </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>death is to be embraced</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, as 'it appears that no less a loss than </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>death is needed for the brilliance of life</span></span><span class='card-underline'> to traverse and transfigure dull existence</span> (Th e Practice of Joy Before Death', 239; OC I, 557). This is not because death is so marvellous, but because it is everywhere, linking the individual to everything else (what Bataille will go on to call the general economy): I can only perceive a succession of cruel splendours whose very movement requires that I die: this death is only the exploding consumption of all that was, the joy of existence of all that comes into the world; even my own life demands that everything that exists, everywhere, ceaselessly give itself and be annihilated. (The Practice of Joy Before Death', 239; OCI, 557) Bataille is not arguing from the perspective whereby the universe only exists in one's own mind, but that even we, pathetic individuals that we are, feature in the ceaseless process of death and destruction. This linkage of the individual, throug h death, to others, to the general economy, is what is pursued in Bataille's connecting of the erotic with death, which is a development of the linkage between sex and death. In Eroticism he uses the term 'continuity to designate both the state of shared existence of asexual reproduction and what lies beyond individuality when individuals lose themselves in sacrifice, erotic activity, laughter, drunkenness and so on (Eroticism, 11-25; OCX, 17-30). These attempts interest him because 'eroticism opens the way to death. Death opens the way to the denial of our individual selves (24; 29). Death 57 The second volume of The Accursed Share, subtitled The History of Eroticism, is often seen as being little more than a draft version of Eroticism, but there are crucial differences in emphasis. The History of Eroticism really is a genuine part of the work on 'the accursed share', whereas such an economy is only implicit in Eroticism. More importantly still, the former seeks to link sexuality to death, and the latter attempts the opposite movement (both movements, for no clear theoretically necessary reason, lead Bataille to associate Woman with death). The second volume of The Accursed Share even starts by stating that it is not really about eroticism, but is instead 'a thinking that does not fall apart in the face of horror', emerging from 'a system of thought exhausting the totality of the possible (The Accursed Share, vol. II, 14; OC VIII, 10). In writing about death as part of the general economy, it also emerges that death is not necessarily literal death. But we should on no account take it as simply a metaphor, as metaphors imply a reality to be represented, and Bataille offers no such real world, existing to be represented in mimesis, metaphor or metonymy. <span class='card-underline'>Death and Fear </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Hegel sees death as the origin of</span></span><span class='card-underline'> humanity's </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>self-consciousness</span></span> (this being, initially, consciousness of death), <span class='card-underline'>and the rest of time consists of the struggle to master death.</span> Communal existence is also centred around death, and the two combine in the form of architecture. According to Hollier, for Hegel, <span class='card-underline'>'architecture is something appearing in the place of death, to point out its presence and to cover it up: the victory of death and the victory over death'</span> (Against Architecture, 6). For Bataille, however, this is precisely the problem: our society is this fearful covering up of death (whereas the Aztecs, for example, exposed death in the sacrifice - at the top of, rather than inside, the pyramid). 2 In The Accursed Share, vol. II, he argues that <span class='card-underline'>all </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>society</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, all individual existence </span>(as opposed to the restricted economy of modern individualism) <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>emerges from this fear of death</span></span><span class='card-underline'> - and this fear is at its most creative when it approaches death. </span>58 Georges Bataille At the same time as <span class='card-underline'>humanity is drawn toward death,</span> it pushes it away - <span class='card-underline'>this repulsion is what defines humanity. </span>Repulsion is the key word, as <span class='card-underline'>death is not simply a negativity, something that happens to the subject, but something that, even when it happens to someone else, provokes disgust. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Humanity is defined by its 'repugnance for death</span></span>/ (The Accursed Share, vol. II, 61; OC VIII, 51). This is hardly a novel or shocking statement, but <span class='card-underline'>death is specifically part of what repels us because we repel it, and arguably the (primordial) object of disgust (and only in becoming human does death constitute something disgusting). </span>Humans have a horror of all that threatens their unitary existence: excretions, filth, loss of control through drunkenness, eroticism (61-2; 51-2). More than this, we also have a horror of life, as at some level we are aware of life as a by-product of death, so much so that 'we might think, if need be, that living<span class='card-underline'> </span>matter on the very level we separate ourselves from it is the privileged object of our disgust (63; 52). All such disgusts are caught up within taboos, in a relation where it is impossible to ascertain whether the taboo created the disgust, or responds to it. For Bataille, however, death really is at the heart of the existence of taboo, but is not the exclusive centre: since it goes without saying, I will not linger over the possible anteriority of the horror of death. This horror is perhaps at the root of our repugnance (the loathing of nothingness would then be at the origin of the loathing of decay, which is not physical since it is not shared by animals) . It is clear, in any event, that the nature of excrement is analogous to that of corpses and that the places of its emission are close to the sexual parts; more often than not, this complex of prohibitions appears inextricable. (79; 68) This complex marks the line of demarcation between human and other and proximity to these phenomena constitutes the crossing of this line. This crossing and the fear of crossing gives the 'universally human character of the problem of obscenity (54; 45), even if contra Freud and Levi-Strauss, for example, there is no particular taboo that is universal.3 <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Death</span></span><span class='card-underline'> is also 'at the beginning insofar as its appearance </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>coincides with labour and utility - this is what makes death a problem</span></span><span class='card-underline'> for the individual, as </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the individual conceives of his or her self as something to be maintained</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, preserved and developed</span> (82; 70) .<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Death</span></span><span class='card-underline'> very rapidly </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>becomes the site of prohibition</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, and takes two principal forms: both murder and 'contact with corpses are forbidden</span> (79; 68). It is not the metaphysical difficulty of impending death that creates this fear, since this arises from an awareness that life is an accident between waste and decay, with only waste and decay in between. As Bataille notes, life is a luxury of which death is the highest degree (85-6; 74) and 'moreover, life is a product of putrefaction (80; 69), so <span class='card-underline'>death and decay are linked to conceptions of our birth and origin </span>(for him, this accounts for 'our fear of menstrual blood, for example). Here, as elsewhere, it is striking how far Bataille goes down a road attacking preconceptions only to launch into a restatement of tired cliches about 'woman as other, as death. He simply does not question the taboos around 'woman', and this is why Kristeva's gloss on Bataille (Powers of Horror) and Mary Douglas's Purity and Danger is so successful - it completes the logic already under way. The all-pervasive absence, or denial, of death, through prohibition, is why death is to be approached, and also why we have an attraction to as well as repulsion from death and all that threatens our identity, so that for example, 'eroticism, it may be said, is assenting to life up to the point of death (Eroticism, 11; OCX, 17). Death and eroticism remain charged with danger, and create anguish in individuals as their individuality falls away (The Accursed Share, vol. II, 101; OC VIII, 88) . 5 But as with Hegel's 'facing up to death', Bataille does not limit the notion of death to actual biological death - it comes to include all that undoes the individual, such that the introduction, or irruption, of death into life makes life become exuberant (99; 86). Erotic activity, for example, must be carried out intensely (otherwise it is just sex), for 'if the sensations do not have their greatest intensity, it is possible for us to isolate objects on the field of the totality (118-19; 102). By totality, <span class='card-underline'>Bataille does not mean the kinds of ideology that account for everything, but the amorphous sphere beyond subjects, and beyond a simple subject/object divide. Even if death is not real, there is no reduction of the experience of approaching death</span> (we can never attain death - in this Bataille is with Heidegger). If <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>we are instructed that to 'live life to the full we must 'embrace death'</span></span>, what do we gain? Nothing much, except the awareness of an impossibility (we do not even gain nothing, as asceticism would aspire to), but what will have happened is the following: the embrace restores us, not to nature (which is itself, if it is not reintegrated, only a detached part), but rather to the totality in which man has his share by losing himself. For an embrace is not just a fall into the animal muck, but the anticipation of death, and the putrefaction that follows it. (119; 103) There is no why, however, and there can only be Virtuar replies to 'why? - i.e. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>there can be the project of approaching death</span></span>, as it enhances subjectivity, <span class='card-underline'>but </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>this project is lost at the moment it is attained,</span></span><span class='card-underline'> whether in actual death or in death-like experience (nonexperience).</span> Note also that the only 'return is to something that is necessarily lost, again and again.

We don't admit this, we don't want to admit it, for a rather sad reason: we are perhaps young at heart, but </span><span class='card-underline'>this doesn't mean we are more alert</span><span class='card-underline'>. Otherwise, how could we not be aware that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>death, and death alone, constantly ensures the renewal of life</span></span>?≥ The worst is that, in a sense, we know this very well, but we are just as quick to forget it. The law given in nature is so simple as to defy ignorance. According to this law, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>life is effusion</span></span><span class='card-underline'>; it is contrary to equilibrium, to stability. It is the tumultuous movement that bursts forth and consumes itself. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Its perpetual explosion is possible on one condition: </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>that the spent organisms give way to new ones</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, which enter the dance with new forces.</span>2 We could really not imagine a more costly process. Life is possible at much less expense: compared to that of an infusorian, the individual organism of a mammal, especially a carnivore, is an abyss where enormous quantities of energy are swallowed up, are destroyed. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The growth of plants presupposes the amassing of decayed substances</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. Plant-eaters consume tons of living (plant) substance before a small amount of meat allows a carnivore its great releases, its great nervous expenditures</span>. It even appears that the more costly the life-generating processes are, the more squander the production of organisms has required, the more satisfactory the operation is. <span class='card-underline'>The principle of producing at the least expense is not so much a human idea as a narrowly capitalist one</span> (it makes sense only from the viewpoint of the incorporated company). <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The movement of human life</span></span><span class='card-underline'> even </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>tends toward anguish, as the sign of expenditures that are finally excessive</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, that go beyond what we can bear. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Everything within us demands that death lay waste to us</span></span><span class='card-underline'>: we anticipate these multiple trials, these new beginnings, unproductive from the standpoint of reason, this wholesale destruction of effective force accomplished in the transfer of one individual's life to other, younger, individuals</span>. Deep down, we even assent to the condition that results, that is almost intolerable, in this condition of individuals destined for suffering and inevitable annihilation. Or rather, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>were it not for this intolerable condition</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, so harsh that the will constantly wavers, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>we would not be satisfied</span></span>. (How significant at present that a book3 is entitled, ludicrously, Afin que nul ne meure!...) Today our judgements are formed in disappointing circumstances: <span class='card-underline'>those among us who best make themselves heard are unaware (and want at all cost to be unaware) that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>life is the luxury of which death is the highest degree</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, that of all the luxuries of life, human life is the most extravagantly expensive, that, finally, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>an increased apprehension of death</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, when life's security wears thin, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is at the highest level of ruinous refinement</span></span> ...

We feel this pressure in moments when instances of suffering and loss are expected to produce or express some reassuring meaning (everything happens for a reason; that person got what he deserved). <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>This mitigating process</span></span><span class='card-underline'> typically </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>happens when individuals</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and communities </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>locate death</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, suffering, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>and</span></span><span class='card-underline'> excessive </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>violence elsewhere</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, in another place and community—</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>a strategy that</span></span><span class='card-underline'> often </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>justifies</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and makes acceptable </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>violent projects</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> to fix</span></span><span class='card-underline'> or restore </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>that other community</span></span>. Therefore, when Bataille says that <span class='card-underline'>“death means everything” to the world of accumulation and duration</span>, he is thinking about how <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the anxiety and horror around death is related to our commitment to qpreserving ourselves in the future</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, a commitment that involves various forms of displacement and deferral</span>. In other words, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the will to futurity intensifies</span></span><span class='card-underline'> the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>anxiety and anguish that accompany</span></span><span class='card-underline'> thoughts and images of death, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>mortality</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, and vulnerability. </span>Of course, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>humans are</span></span><span class='card-underline'> also </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>fascinated</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> with images</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, and practices, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>of</span></span><span class='card-underline'> violence and </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>death, but only</span></span><span class='card-underline'> if they can experience and view these images </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>from a comfortable distance</span></span><span class='card-underline'> or participate in these practices in a manner that reduces the risks to the self’s coherence and duration</span>.9 On the duplicity of the self’s relationship to violence, Bataille writes, “<span class='card-underline'>Violence, and death signifying violence, have a double meaning. On the one hand </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the horror of death drives us off</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, for we prefer life; on </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the</span></span><span class='card-underline'> other an </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>element</span></span><span class='card-underline'> at once solemn and terrifying </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>fascinates us</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and disturbs us profoundly</span>” (Bataille 1986, 45). What is crucial here is that the order of things, the order of life preservation, is defined over and against death and loss—<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>death means everything to this order</span></span>. Yet I also take Bataille to be suggesting that everyday <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>projects</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and strategies </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>of selfpreservation are implicated in the</span></span><span class='card-underline'> mundane, often undetected, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>exploitation and suffering of others</span></span>; again, death means everything to the real world. Therefore, <span class='card-underline'>the human self is a site of a paradox: the world of projects, goals, and accumulation “imparts an unreal character to death even though man’s membership in this world is tied to the positing of the body as a thing insofar as it is mortal”</span> (Bataille 2006, 46). According to Bataille, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>our</span></span><span class='card-underline'> general </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>commitment to duration</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, to reproducing life, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>will always mean that some being</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, force, or desire </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>will be marked as a threat</span></span><span class='card-underline'> or danger to that reproduction</span>. And <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>those threats will have to be managed, assimilated, disciplined, or subordinated in some manner</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. One’s ability to endure in this world, to accumulate recognition, prestige, and various kinds of capital means that one must separate oneself, to some extent, from those qualities and characteristics that endanger self or communal projects and aspirations</span>. To put it differently, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>life needs to be cordoned off from death and tho</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>se beings associated with death</span></span> (even as we know that life and death are always intertwined and that certain kinds of subjects and communities are made more vulnerable to death and its intimations). Here Bataille’s line of thought converges with Baldwin’s point about social life providing a kind of barrier to “menacing” forces, to beings and desires that signify chaos and disorder. If Baldwin and Bataille are right, then racism, which is always about marking, disciplining, and managing “dangerous” bodies and communities, must be confronted alongside fundamental social and human limitations.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Recognizing the mortality inherent to human existence is essential to achieve liberation.

Since appearance constitutes a limit, what truly exists is a dissolution into common opacity rather than a development of lucid thinking. The apparent unchangingness of books is deceptive: each book is also the sum of the misunderstandings it occasions</span>. <span class='card-underline'>So why exhaust myself with efforts toward consciousness? I can only make fun of myself as I write. (Why write even a phrase if laughter doesn't immediately join me?)</span> It goes without saying that, for the task, I bring to bear whatever rigor I have within me. But the crumbling nature of thinking's awareness of itself and especially the certainty of <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>thinking reaching its end only in failing</span></span>, hinder any repose and prevent the relaxed state that facilitates a rigorous disposition of things. Committed to the casual stance--<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>I think</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and express myself </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>in the free play of hazard</span></span>. Obviously, everyone in some way admits the importance of hazard. But this recognition is as minimal and unconscious as possible. <span class='card-underline'>Going my way unconstrained, unhampered, I develop my thoughts, make choices with regard to expression--but I don't have the control over myself that I want. And the actual dynamic of my intelligence is equally uncontrollable</span>. So that I owe to other dynamics--to lucky chance and to fleeting moments of relaxation--the minimal order and relative learning that I do have. And the rest of the time . . . Thus, as <span class='card-underline'>I see it </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>my thought proceeds in harmony with its object</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, an object that it attains more and perfectly the greater the state of its own ruin. Though it isn't necessarily conscious of this. At one and the same time </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>my thinking must reach plenary illumination and dissolution</span></span><span class='card-underline'> . . . In the same individual, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>thought must construct and destroy itself</span></span>. And even that isn't quite right. Even the most rigorous thinkers yield to chance. In addition, the demands inherent in the exercise of thought often take me far from where I started. One of the great difficulties encountered by understanding is to put order into thought's interrelations in time. In a given moment, my thought reaches considerable rigor. But how to link it with yesterday's thinking? Yesterday, in a sense, I was another person, responding to other worries. Adapting one to the other remains possible, but . . . This insufficiency bothers me no more than the insufficiency relating to the many woes of the human condition generally. Humanness is related in us to nonsatisfaction, a nonsatisfaction to which we yield without accepting it, though; we distance ourselves from humanness when we regard ourselves as satisfied or when we give up searching for satisfaction. Sartre is right in relation to me to recall the myth of Sisyphus, though "in relation to me" here equates to "in relation to humanity," I suppose. What can be expected of us is to go as far as possible and not to stop. What by contrast, humanly speaking, can be criticized are endeavors whose only meaning is some relation to moments of completion. Is it possible for me to go further? I won't wait to coordinate my efforts in that case--I'll go further. I'll take the risk. And the reader, free not to venture after me, will often take advantage of that same freedom! The critics are right to scent danger here! But let me in turn point out a greater danger, one that comes from methods that, adequate only to an outcome of knowledge, confer on individuals whom they limit a sheerly fragmentary existence--an existence that is mutilated with respect to the whole that remains inaccessible. Having recognized this, I'll defend my position. I've spoken of inner experience: my intention was to make known an object. But by proposing this vague title, I didn't want to confine myself sheerly to inner facts of that experience. It's an arbitrary procedure to reduce knowledge to what we get from our intuitions as subjects. This is something only a newborn can do. And we ourselves (who write) can only know something about this newborn by observing it from outside (the child is only our object). A separation experience, related to a vital continuum (our conception and our birth) and to a return to that continuum (in our first sexual feelings and our first laughter), leaves us without any clear recollections, and only in objective operations do we reach the core of the being we are. A phenomenology of the developed mind assumes a coincidence of subjective and objective aspects and at the same time a fusion of subject and object. * [This is the fundamental requirement of Hegel's phenomenology. Clearly, instead of responding to it, modern phenomenology, while replying to changing human thought, is only one moment among others: a sandcastle, a mirage of sorts.] This means an isolated operation is admissible only because of fatigue (so, the explanation I gave of laughter, because I was unable to develop a whole movement in tandem with a conjugation of the modalities of laughter would be left suspended--since every theory of laughter is integrally a philosophy and, similarly, every integral philosophy is a theory of laughter . . .). But that is the point--though I set forth these principles, at the same time I must renounce following them. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Thought is produced</span></span><span class='card-underline'> in me </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>as uncoordinated flashes</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, withdrawing endlessly from a term to which its movement pushes it</span>. I can't tell if I'm expressing human helplessness this way, or my own . . . I don't know, though I'm not hopeful of even some outwardly satisfying outcome. Isn't there an advantage in creating philosophy as I do? A flash in the night--a language belonging to a brief moment . . . Perhaps in this respect this latest moment contains a simple truth. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>In order to will knowledge</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, by an indirect expedient </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>I tend to become the whole universe</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. But </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>in this movement I can't be a whole human being</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, since I submit to a particular goal, becoming the whole. Granted, if I could become it, I would thus be a whole human being. But in my effort, don't I distance myself from exactly that? And </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>how can I become the whole without becoming a whole human being? </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>I can't be this whole human being except when I let go</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. I can't be this through willpower: my will necessarily has to will outcomes! But if misfortune (or chance) wills me to let go, then I know I am an integral, whole humanness, subordinate to nothing</span>. In other words, <span class='card-underline'>the moment of revolt inherent in willing a knowledge beyond practical ends can't be indefinitely continued. And </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>in order to be the whole universe, humankind has to let go and abandon its principle</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, accepting as the sole criterion of what it is the tendency to go beyond what it is</span>. This existence that I am is a revolt against existence and is indefinite desire. For this existence God was simply a stage and now here he is, looming large, grown from unfathomable experience, comically perched on the stake used for impalement. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>My method has confusion as a consequence</span></span><span class='card-underline'>--and in the long run </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>this confusion is unbearable</span></span> (particularly for me!). This is something to be corrected if possible . . . But for now, I want to elucidate the meaning of the above words. For me <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>nothingness is a limit of an individual existence. Beyond its defined limits</span></span><span class='card-underline'>--in time and in space--</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>this existence or being no longer exists</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, no longer is. For us, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>that nonbeing is filled with meaning: </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>I know I can be reduced to nothing</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>.

The <span class='card-underline'>meaning that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>nonmeaning</span></span><span class='card-underline'> has</span>, according to Bataille, <span class='card-underline'>is the meaning contained in the fact that it (nonmeaning) </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>intoxicates</span></span><span class='card-underline'> him. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>This is an </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>affective meaning</span></span>.

From this it would seem that <span class='card-underline'>Sartre’s criticism of inner experience as mere “emptiness” is a claim </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>that </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>inner experience</span></span><span class='card-underline'> does not have adequate or satisfactory ends</span><span class='card-underline'>. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>“Emptiness”</span></span><span class='card-underline'> in this sense </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is</span></span><span class='card-underline'> an accusation of </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>a lack of telos</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> Bataille is not bothered by this. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Bataille wanted inner experience to be </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>aimless but affectively productive</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> This is significant with regard to knowledge and nonknowledge: <span class='card-underline'>Sartre is right in relation to me to recall the myth of Sisyphus</span>, though ‘in relation to me’ here equates to ‘in relation to humanity,’ I suppose. <span class='card-underline'>What can be expected of us is to go as far as possible and not to stop</span>. What by contrast, humanly speaking, can be criticized are endeavors whose only meaning is some relation to moments of completion. <span class='card-underline'>Is it possible for me to go further? I won’t wait to coordinate my efforts in that case—I’ll go further. I’ll take the risk.</span> And readers, free not to venture after me, will often take advantage of that same freedom! <span class='card-underline'>The critics are right to scent danger here! But let me in turn point out a greater danger</span>, one that comes from methods that, adequate only to an outcome of knowledge, <span class='card-underline'>confer on individuals whom they limit a sheerly fragmentary existence—an existence that is mutilated with respect to the whole that remains inaccessible</span> (ON 174-5). <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>If inner experience were not aimless</span></span><span class='card-underline'>—if it had a simple, definitive outcome—</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the outcome would be knowledge</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. And experience is necessarily different from methods of contemplation and contestation which set out with knowledge as their outcome. Hence inner experience’s relation to nonknowledge: </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>inner experience produces some absence of knowledge, and it does not seek knowledge</span></span><span class='card-underline'> or anything in particular as a goal, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>paving the way for nonknowledge</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. Inner experience is also different from “methods” which require an individual to live a “fragmentary existence</span>,” separate and apart from some “whole” which remains inaccessible to them. This <span class='card-underline'>separation from some whole is a greater danger than the danger of a task as Sisyphean as endless contestation.</span> Bataille’s claim that <span class='card-underline'>inner experience is not the kind of method which requires individuals to live fragmentedly,</span> and separate, from some essential whole recalls his distinction between “continuity” and “discontinuity.” <span class='card-underline'>Bataille is suggesting that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>inner experience allows him to live with access to a whole</span></span><span class='card-underline'>—as part of the whole—that would otherwise</span> (with other methods) <span class='card-underline'>remain inaccessible</span>. The method which <span class='card-underline'>entails inaccessibility to the whole recalls discontinuity, and the method of being part of or caught up in the whole</span> (inner experience) <span class='card-underline'>recalls continuity</span>. It matters little what particular “method” or methods Bataille is using to describe inner experience. <span class='card-underline'>What matters in identifying such methods is that they are </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>methods that expect knowledge</span></span><span class='card-underline'> as the outcome and that they achieve the outcome by </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>limit</span></span><span class='card-underline'>ing </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>individuals to </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>fragmentary existences</span></span><span class='card-underline'> without access to the whole of which they are seeking part (in the form of “knowledge”). </span>We will not see this concern for continuity in our virtue epistemology conversation, nor will we see knowledge characterized as fragmenting, or splintering. In Sensible Ecstasy, Amy Hollywood offers her analysis of Jean-Paul Sartre’s critique of Bataille in relation to Bataille’s desire for continuity over and above any desire for identifiable outcomes: “Sartre’s and Bataille’s opposing attitudes toward human projects are crucial here. Sartre insists that to be human is to engage in projects; <span class='card-underline'>Bataille argues that inner experience is the opposite of project”</span> (30). (And inner experience is especially not a project of self-improvement.) <span class='card-underline'>Thus Bataille “generates endlessly recursive negations of his own attempt to provide a method for attaining inner experience</span>” (ibid). <span class='card-underline'>According to Hollywood, this is ultimately the problem Sartre has with all of Inner </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Experience</span></span><span class='card-underline'>; that is, it has no method, it offers no clear goal, it </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is useless</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, it is not a </span>project. “For Sartre, if inner experience does not give rise to new enterprises it is worth nothing more than ‘the pleasure of drinking a glass of alcohol or of warming oneself in the sun at the beach’ [ON 173]. Such experiences are, for Sartre, ‘useless’” (SE 31). Excesses are permissible for Sartre, Hollywood writes, as long as they are channeled fully into project—whether the project is political or personal. “Only if these excesses are contained by project can they be meaningful and useful” (SE 33). However, the intoxication that inner experience and its nonmeaning produce are all we need to reply to Sartre: <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>nonmeaning is not a total absence of meaning. Nonmeaning provides</span></span><span class='card-underline'> some kind of </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>meaning in the form</span></span><span class='card-underline'> of intoxication, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>of </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>affect</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. We will see that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the same is true of nonknowledge</span></span><span class='card-underline'>: nonknowledge is not a total absence of knowledge, and its clearest meaning is an affective meaning. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Nonknowledge does not have a</span></span><span class='card-underline'> particular kind of </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>recuperable use</span></span>. Inner Experience, Inner Experience, and Nonknowledge <span class='card-underline'>Bataille closes his reply to Sartre with a description of inner experience itself: it is the movement of “willing a knowledge beyond practical ends</span>” (ON 176). Bataille acknowledges that <span class='card-underline'>this willing “can’t be indefinitely continued</span>” (ibid). <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Knowledge “beyond practical ends” is nonknowledge</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. Inner Experience</span> (the text and the concept) <span class='card-underline'>is thus a method and a non-method for arriving at nonknowledge</span>. If reading <span class='card-underline'>Inner Experience</span> moves one to pursue experience, it <span class='card-underline'>opens up the possibility of arriving at nonknowledge</span>. The “<span class='card-underline'>method” inspires anguish because it produces only knowledge beyond practical ends—useless pseudo-knowledge</span>. The <span class='card-underline'>method looks, sounds, and seems like mystical ecstasy from the outside, but, according to Bataille, it can be and is understood differently from the “inside</span>55.” The method of <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>inner experience</span></span><span class='card-underline'> is not just an avenue to nonknowledge; it </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is</span></span><span class='card-underline'> partially </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>constitutive of nonknowledge. </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>It is an element of nonknowledge</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>.</span></span></p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Bataille’s theory is functionally useless (no pun intended) in the era of postmodern consumer capitalism</div><div class='cite'>Yang 2000 (Mayfair Mei-hui Yang is a Professor of Anthropology at the University of California Santa Barbara, “Putting Global Capitalism in Its Place: Economic Hybridity, Bataille, and Ritual Expenditure,” Current Anthropology, University of Chicago Journals ///ghs-sc)</div><div class='card-body'><p>Scholars such as Jean‐Joseph Goux (1998) have pointed to a troubling overlap between Bataille’s views on luxury and sacrificial expenditure and postmodern consumer capitalism. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Consumer capitalism is</span></span><span class='card-underline'> also </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>predicated on massive consumption and waste</span></span><span class='card-underline'> rather than on the thrift, asceticism, and accumulation against which Bataille directed his theory of expenditure.</span> It exhibits potlatch features in the tendency for businesses to give goods away in the hope that “supply creates its own demand”; it collapses the distinction between luxury and useful goods and between need and desire (Goux 1998).

It seems to me that despite their overt similarities, <span class='card-underline'>the principles of ritual consumption and those of consumer capitalism are basically incompatible. If Bataille had addressed our consumer society today, he would have said that this sort of consumption is still in the service of production and productive accumulation</span>, since every act of consumption<span class='card-underline'> </span>in the world of leisure, entertainment, media, fashion, and home décor merely feeds back into the growth of the economy rather than leading to the finality and loss of truly nonproductive expenditure. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Even much of modern warfare is no longer truly destructive but tied into the furthering of military</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>‐</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>industrial production</span></span>.

It is unlikely that Bataille would applaud Manson for the same reason he ultimately rejects Sade. They are both indiscriminate; they both go too far. "Continuity is what we are after," Bataille confirms, but generally only if that continuity which the death of discontinuous beings can alone establish is not the victor in the long run. What we desire is to bring into a world founded on discontinuity all the continuity such a world can sustain. De Sade's aberration exceeds that limit. (Bataille 1962, 13) In other words, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>our</span></span><span class='card-underline'> wasteful </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>consumption must</span></span><span class='card-underline'> also </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>have </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>limits.

Later on in Death and Sensuality, Bataille continues, Short of a paradoxical capacity to defend the indefensible, no one would suggest that the cruelty of the heroes of Justine and Juliette should not be wholeheartedly abominated. It is a denial of the principles on which humanity is founded. <span class='card-underline'>We are bound to reject something that would end in the ruin of all our </span><span class='card-underline'>works. If instinct urges</span><span class='card-underline'> us to destroy the very thing we are building we must condemn those instincts and defend ourselves from them</span>. (Bataille 1962, 179-80)      This passage is crucial for understanding Bataille's ethics. Usually Bataille writes on behalf of the violence that remains unaffected by absolute prohibitions. Prohibitions cannot obviate this transformative violence. There is always ample motive to produce the experiences of sacred transformation, i.e., to transgress the prohibitions. Yet <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>self-preservation is</span></span><span class='card-underline'> also </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>a fundamental value</span></span><span class='card-underline'> for Bataille; </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>there is</span></span><span class='card-underline'> also </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>ample motive to resist the violence that denies the value of the well being of life itself</span></span>.

In Kiribati alone, climate change is likely to cause problems not only because some villages are submerged; saltwater is already affecting drinking water supplies and the ability to grow food.

Households and individuals decide whether to stay or leave</p><p><span class='card-underline'>The reasons for flight and migration are complex</span>. Researchers have shown that <span class='card-underline'>migration is usually based on decisions made by households and individuals who are influenced in turn by many</span> (often interconnected) <span class='card-underline'>push and pull factors</span>.16 <span class='card-underline'>These decisions are often not voluntary</span>, <span class='card-underline'>but attempts to ensure survival, escape extreme poverty, to live in dignity, or flee from violence, persecution and war</span>. In some African states, entire villages will pool the means for travel and decide together which member of the village should migrate to later support the community with remittances, invitations for visa applications, and the like. It is almost impossible for the individuals selected to oppose this collective decision because they and their families would otherwise become isolated in the community.</p><p>The diagram illustrates <span class='card-underline'>the complexity of decisions regarding migration. Factors on three different levels influence the decision to stay or leave</span>. At the macro-level, changes in politics, economics, society, environment, demographics and land use, as well as conflicts and war, play a role. Although each of these factors can be the most important driver of migration, <span class='card-underline'>people often decide to leave their home or stay when changes in several of these areas coincide. Changes in one area affect other areas, potentially causing the overall situation of inhabitants to greatly deteriorate</span> (or improve). If climate change continues to advance, worsening or even destroying the livelihoods of more and more people, it will become a more significant factor. Of key importance, of course, is whether the targeted region or country will even permit entry and residence.</p><p>Specific contexts (meso-level in the diagram) also contribute to decisions on migration. Social networks in the homeland and in the diaspora can act both as drivers or inhibitors of migration. Agencies for recruiting workers outside the region simplify migration. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Measures to adapt to climate change, such as local protection programs against hurricanes/cyclones or floods, and aid for post-disaster construction, can persuade people to stay or return</span></span>. Not least, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the costs of migration are crucial for deciding whether people can undertake the journey at all</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>.</span></p><p>Poverty can be a driver of, or an obstacle to migration. The search for better livelihoods motivates people to migrate, but <span class='card-underline'>poor people </span><span class='card-underline'>in particular do</span><span class='card-underline'> not often have the financial means to do so</span>. On the micro-level, it is not only prosperity/poverty and individual goals that play a role, but <span class='card-underline'>many other factors as well, such as language, ethnicity, religion, age, gender and education. The extent to which decision makers are informed about dangers, risks and opportunities is also of great importance</span>. Many migrants and communities sending off a village member do not seem to know how dangerous it is to cross the Sahara and the Mediterranean, and how radically Europe is closing its doors to refugees. Research based on interviews has shown that <span class='card-underline'>island inhabitants in the South Pacific are not necessarily well-informed about the consequences of climate change</span>. To be able to plan their lives, it is essential that islanders be aware that sea levels will continue to rise. To fill this gap in knowledge, Fiji has now introduced climate change as a subject at school.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Climate changes doesn’t correlate with more refugees – political stability is the primary reason</div><div class='cite'>Mark Maslin, 6-12-2018, A Professor ff Earth System Science At University College London And Founding Director Of Rezatec Ltd, A U.K.-Based Geospatial Data Analytics Company, Undark, https://undark.org/article/climate-change-migrations-conflict/ //Frese</div><div class='card-body'><p>THE DARFUR CONFLICT began as an ecological crisis”, wrote the then-UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon back in 2007, about an ongoing war which arose, he said, “at least in part from climate change.” Since then <span class='card-underline'>the idea that climate change has caused and will cause human conflict and mass migrations has become more and more accepted</span> — just look at the claimed effects of droughts in Syria and Ethiopia.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>The media has even started using terms such as “climate refugees” and “environmental migrants” to describe people fleeing their homes</span> from these climate-driven conflicts. But <span class='card-underline'>it isn’t clear whether there is much evidence for this link between climate change and conflict</span> — there certainly seems to be no consensus within the academic literature.</p><p>In our recent paper, my student Erin Owain and I decided to test the climate-conflict hypothesis, using East Africa as our focus. The region is already very hot and very poor, making it especially vulnerable to climate change (in fact neighbouring Chad is by some measures the single most vulnerable country in the world).</p><p>As the planet warms, East Africa’s seasonal rains are expected to become much more unpredictable. This is a particular problem as recent economic development has been concentrated in agriculture, a highly climate-sensitive sector that accounts for more than half of the entire economy in countries like Ethiopia or Sudan. One study led by the European Commission found that declining rainfall over the past century may have reduced GDP across Africa by 15-40 percent compared with the rest of the developing world.</p><p>East Africa also has a long history of conflict and human displacement, which persists in some countries to this day, such as the civil wars in Sudan and Somalia. The UN Refugee Agency reports there were more than 20 million displaced people in Africa in 2016 — a third of the world’s total. The World Bank predicts this could rise up to 86 million by 2050 due to climate change.</p><p>To test the climate-conflict hypothesis, <span class='card-underline'>Erin and I therefore focused on the 10 main countries in East Africa. We used a new database that records major episodes of political violence and number of total displaced people for the past 50 years for each of the 10 countries. We then statistically compared these records both at a country and a regional level with the appropriate climatic, economic, and political indicators</span>.</p><p>We found that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>climate variations such as regional drought and global temperature did not significantly impact the level of regional conflict or the number of total displaced people</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>.</span> <span class='card-underline'>The major driving forces on conflict were rapid </span><span class='card-underline'>population growth</span>, <span class='card-underline'>reduced or negative economic growth and instability of political regimes</span>. <span class='card-underline'>Numbers of total displaced people were linked to rapid population growth and low or stagnating economic growth</span>.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>The evidence from East Africa is that no single factor can fully explain conflict and the displacement of people</span>. Instead, <span class='card-underline'>conflict seems to be linked primarily to long-term population growth</span>, short-term economic recessions and extreme political instability. Halvard Buhaug, a professor at the Peace Research Institute Oslo, looked at the same questions in 2015 and his study reached much the same conclusion: sociopolitical factors were more important than climate change.</p><p>Things were different for “refugees,” however — those displaced people who were forced to cross borders between countries. <span class='card-underline'>Refugee numbers were related to the usual demographic and socio-economic factors</span>. But in contrast to total displaced people and occurrence of conflict, variations in refugee numbers were found to be related significantly to the incidence of severe regional droughts. And these droughts can in turn be linked to a long-term drying trend ascribed to anthropogenic climate change.</p><p>However, it is important to consider the counterfactual: <span class='card-underline'>had</span> <span class='card-underline'>there been slower population growth, stronger economies and more stable political regimes, would these droughts still have led to more refugees?</span> That’s beyond the scope of our study, which may not be a definitive test of the links between climate change and conflict. But <span class='card-underline'>the occurrence of peaks in both conflict and displaced people in the 1980s and 1990s across East Africa suggest that decolonization and the end of the Cold War could have been key issues</span>.</p><p>Nonetheless, <span class='card-underline'>while conflict has decreased across the region since the end of the Cold War, the number of displaced people remains high</span>. We argue that <span class='card-underline'>with good stable governance there is no reason why climate change should lead to greater conflict or displacement of people</span>, despite the World Bank’s dire predictions. Water provides one reason to be optimistic. The UN reports that, over the past 50 years, there have been 150 international water resource treaties signed compared to 37 disputes that involved violence.</p><p>What our study suggests is <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the failure of political systems is the primary cause of conflict and displacement of large numbers of people</span></span>. We also demonstrate that within socially and geopolitically fragile systems, climate change may potentially exacerbate the situation particularly with regards to enforced migration.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Climate change doesn’t cause conflict </div><div class='cite'>Kita et. al 18 (Stern Mwakalimi, Research student in Geography at the University of Sussex, Environmental migration and international political security from: Routledge Handbook of Environmental Displacement and Migration, pg. 358-359//waters)</div><div class='card-body'><p>Using similar datasets from similar geographical locations, other <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>scholars have found no link between environmental change and conflict</span></span>.

They also found a 9<span class='card-underline'>% global coincident rate of armed conflict outbreak and occurrence of natural disasters. </span>However, it is important to note that their study does not show any evidence of armed conflicts being directly triggered by climate-related disasters, but simply an occasional and infrequent temporal coincidence. In a study on the link between environmental scarcity and conflict in 39 Sub-Saharan countries, Bell and Keys (2016) identified <span class='card-underline'>three socio-political conditions that explain the link between environmental scarcity and civil conflict: social vulnerability, unequal resource distribution and the capacity of the state</span>. Noteworthy is that <span class='card-underline'>the study found no evidence that drought increases the risk of armed conflict in fragile states, even those where socio-political conditions </span><span class='card-underline'>favour</span><span class='card-underline'> conflict outbreak</span>. A study by Hegre et al. (2016) found <span class='card-underline'>no significant effect of temperature anomalies on the risk of conflict</span>, but the authors did suggest that climate change may lead to low socioeconomic growth that may lead to further conflict. This could also affect investment in climate change adaptation and mitigation, especially in low-income countries. <span class='card-underline'>In a study on Sub-Saharan Africa</span>, Buhaug et al. (2015) <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>analysed</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> data on climate variability, food production and conflict over a 50-year period and found no effect of food production shocks on the likelihood of conflict</span></span><span class='card-underline'>,</span> dispelling the position that harvest failure and bad weather conditions contribute to violence in Africa. They argue that political and <span class='card-underline'>socioeconomic factors</span> such as corruption, market failures and government policies <span class='card-underline'>better explain occurrence of civil unrest</span> in times of food crisis. Investigating the possibility that climate affects conflict risk through economic challenges, van Weezel (2013) studied rainfall and conflict patterns between 1981 and 2010 in Sub- Saharan Africa and concluded that <span class='card-underline'>there is no robust link between rainfall failure, an important determinant of crop failure in Sub-Saharan Africa, and conflict onset</span>, directly or indirectly. A study by Ayana et al. (2016) focused on pastoralists in East Africa, and found that <span class='card-underline'>livelihood stresses due to rainfall and forage yields fail to predict the occurrence and location of conflicts</span>. Bergholt and Lujala (2012) have demonstrated that even the indirect link between climate change and conflict is suspect. The authors used historical data for the period 1980–2007 to show that <span class='card-underline'>severe and frequent climate-induced disasters create income shocks and affect</span> Gross Domestic Product (<span class='card-underline'>GDP) growth</span> of affected countries, <span class='card-underline'>but do not lead to conflict outbreaks directly or indirectly</span>. Many studies result in counterclaims by other scholars, with the ensuing debates often centering on data and methods. For example, when Burke et al. (2009) claimed that Sub-Saharan African temperature increases contributed to conflict outbreak in the region, Buhaug (2010) questioned the veracity of such claims given the restricted time period used in the study by Burke and colleagues (the years 1981–2002), and suggested that the study used a purposefully narrow definition of conflicts, and other methodological oddities. Buhaug therefore reached an opposite conclusion: <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>climate change and variability are poor predictors of conflicts in Africa</span></span>. After recalibrating their models, Burke and colleagues found that the purported relationship vanished, and accepted that their earlier results were wrong (Aldhous, 2010). In another study, Hsiang and Burke (2014: 42) examined 50 quantitative studies and found “strong support for a causal association between climatological changes and conflict across a range of geographies, a range of different time periods, a range of spatial scales and across climatic events of different duration.”This led them to presume that the ‘climate security’ was firmly based in evidence. In response, Buhaug et al. (2014) identified three challenges with the study: across-study independence, causal homogeneity and sample representativeness. They employed the same method, but were not able to replicate the original results on climate change and conflicts using the same cases used by Hsiang and Burke (2014). </p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>The aff fails – not quick enough, broadening refugees undermines funding and allow renegotiation to dilute obligations</div><div class='cite'>W.

The UNHCR already struggles to provide adequate support for the world’s 22.5m refugees (from war and persecution). <span class='card-underline'>During the Syrian refugee crisis, it admitted to being “stretched to the limit”</span>. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>If the UNHCR broadens its definition of “refugee” to support an entirely new category, it is unclear if the political appetite exists to provide the necessary funding</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>.</span></p><p><span class='card-underline'>Nina </span><span class='card-underline'>Birkeland</span><span class='card-underline'>, senior adviser for disasters and climate change at the Norwegian Refugee Council, says that the process of renegotiating the existing refugee treaty or </span><span class='card-underline'>creating a new one could take decades</span>. <span class='card-underline'>Experts also worry that political opportunists, who regard the current refugee convention as being too generous, would use its renegotiation as an opportunity to dilute current obligations</span>. Perhaps more importantly, some of those affected do not want to be called “refugees”. The former president of the central Pacific nation of Kiribati, Anote Tong, resisted the label, stressing that his people wished to “migrate with dignity”. Slowly unfolding disasters brought about by rising sea levels, desertification and droughts result in complex and often gradual patterns of movement. Their victims resist easy classification.</p><p>At the same time, <span class='card-underline'>New Zealand is set to become the first country to </span><span class='card-underline'>recognise</span><span class='card-underline'> the impact of climate change as grounds for a claim of asylum</span>. The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has plans to create a special visa for Pacific Islanders forced to relocate because of rising sea levels. <span class='card-underline'>Though the scheme will only offer 100 visas annually, it sets a precedent</span>. Indeed state-led solutions offer the best hope for such refugees. The Platform on Disaster Displacement (PDD), launched in 2016 by a coalition of national governments, will encourage countries to assist these migrants despite the lack of legal recognition of their plight. It builds on a “Protection Agenda” that 109 countries endorsed in 2015, and aims to integrate its principles into national laws. <span class='card-underline'>The PDD’s reach is more limited than that of the UN agencies. It cannot create new global legal standards</span>. But supporters argue that it provides the most effective way to organise the necessary resources. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>With climate change set to cause new waves of migration, </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>states cannot implement new rules quickly enough</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>.</span></p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'><span class='card-underline'>The US has </span><span class='card-underline'>it’s</span><span class='card-underline'> own climate issues – the plan would exacerbate them</span></div><div class='cite'>Pilkey et al 16 – professor of Earth and Ocean science at Duke, geologist in the State of Washington’s Department of Ecology, and professor of mechanical engineering at Queen’s Univesity (Orrin, Linda, and Keith respectively, “Coastal Calamaties”, “Retreat from a rising sea”, 2 May 2016)//abaime </div><div class='card-body'><p>Other ﬂat, low-lying stretches of land next to the sea include the northeastern corner of mainland North Carolina, which is one of <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>three areas in the lower 48 states most threatened by sea-level rise</span></span>. The Mississippi Delta and South Florida are the other two areas with this distinction. The mainland behind the Outer Banks of North Carolina is a broad, ﬂat, swampy area (including the Great Dismal Swamp) surrounding Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds. Compared with the residents of the barrier islands facing the sea, the mainland folks are, on average, less prosperous, less visible, less educated, and less influential in the North Carolina political scene.

In 2010, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) gave North Carolina a $5 million grant to map the northeastern corner of the state, including maps of the predicted storm-surge levels with various sea-level rise scenarios of 1.5 feet, 3 feet, and 5 feet likely to occur by the year 2100.

As mentioned above, it may be difficult in practice to identify persons who migrate due to climate change be- cause migration decisions are typically the result of several factors</span>. 66 While the environment may influence migration decisions, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>environmental considerations are rarely the sole factor determining the decision to migrate</span></span>. The multi- migration to climate change.'67 Setting to the side the prevailing multi-factorial understanding of migra- tion decisions, B&B, D&G, and HEA recommend definitions intended to confine the beneficiaries of their proposals to climate refugees or climate change displaced persons.'68 <span class='card-underline'>It is questionable whether the proposals' definitions would cover all people migrating because of climate change while excluding people migrating for other reasons, assuming, as the proposals must, that it is possible to identify people moving because of climate change.</span> B&B propose to "restrict the notion of climate refugees to the victims of a set of three direct, largely undisputed climate change impacts: sea-level rise, extreme weather events, and drought and water scarcity."' 61 9 In addition, B&B propose to differentiate the level of funding available from their Climate Refu- gee Protection and Resettlement Fund based on the extent to which the eligible impact can be causally linked with climate change. Full reimbursement would be available for the incremental costs due to sea-level rise on the basis that "general causality with climate change is undisputed" while only "additional funding" would be available for migration due to the other climate impacts on the basis that climate might be "only one causal factor to account for environmental degradation."' However, if the goal is to assist climate migrants, B&B's highly specific definition of climate refugee might be under-inclusive. As D&G argue, B&B's decision to restrict eligibility to persons moving due to three types of climate impact "does not take into account the possibility that advances in science could enable more accurate determination of which events are caused by cli- mate change."'' Thus B&B's restrictive list of impacts risks excluding from coverage persons who are displaced due to impacts that future science suggests are climate impacts. In addition, B&B's definition includes a number of exclusions that could be questioned. The definition excludes persons who migrate for reasons that B&B deem indirectly related to climate change, "such as international or na- tional conflicts over diminishing natural resources."'172 For example, while B&B would cover refugees from drought, they would not cover persons who flee conflicts triggered by the same drought.173 B&B also would exclude per- sons who migrate due to efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change, such 1 74 as the building of dams or planting of "biofuels crops."' There is a smaller risk that B&B's definition also could be over-inclusive. Future science might suggest that components of the three types of impacts that B&B would cover should not be attributed to climate change. Also, as B&B acknowledge, extreme weather events, drought, and water scarcity generally may be linked to climate change, but climate change also might be only one factor contributing to them. B&B's effort to address this multi-causality by limiting the funding for migration due to these environmental impacts to "addi- tional" funding begs the question of how the Climate Refugee and Resettle- ment Fund would ensure it reimburses only for the portion attributable to climate change.'75 If the Fund paid for more than the migration due to climate- related drought damage, it would overpay in B&B's terms. Conversely, it would underpay if it paid for less than the migration due to climate-related drought. D&G limit the beneficiaries of their proposal by defining a "climate change refugee as an individual who is forced to flee his or her home and to relocate temporarily or permanently across a national boundary as the resultof a sudden or gradual environmental disruption that is consistent with climate change and to which humans more likely than not contributed."176 D&G envis- age that a "body of scientific experts" created by their proposed convention would define the disruptions that the convention would cover and periodically review whether disruptions should be incorporated into or removed from the 177 eligible list. HEA largely follow D&G in attempting to circumscribe the beneficiaries of their proposal by limiting them to persons moving due to events that are "consistent with climate change and to which humans very likely contributed," rather than itemizing a list of covered climate change impacts. 78 However, HEA argue that their "'very likely' standard" would make it harder than D&G's "'more likely than not' standard" to gain coverage, and accordingly their standard would better target resources to assist persons moving due to assist policymakers in applying the definition. Is0 The open-endedness of the definitions of D&G and HEA may detract from their efforts to assist climate migrants but only such migrants. D&G and HEA emphasize that the IPCC has been able to identify impacts "as 'consistent with"' climate change."'1 They also are confident in the ability of science to indicate whether environmental disruptions consistent with climate change are related to human actions, based again on the work of the IPCC.82 However, in characterizing a type of disruption as consistent with climate change or related to human activity, scientists will likely be making judgments amid uncertainty. Moreover, <span class='card-underline'>they presumably will be doing so with the knowledge that their characterizations of disruptions may influence policymakers' determinations about eligibility for protection under the climate migration instrument</span>." 3 If the scientists are apt to err on the side of over-inclusion in the face of uncertainty, eligibility might be extended beyond the limits that D&G and HEA envisage. On the other hand, if the scientists are inclined to err on the side of under- inclusion in the face of uncertainty, eligibility might be overly constrained. The <span class='card-underline'>open-ended definitions</span> of D&G and HEA <span class='card-underline'>carry the danger of de facto delegating their conventions' breadth of coverage to a body of scientists</span>. Despite the difficulties with each proposal's definition of the intended ben- eficiaries, it may be possible to devise a definition that in principle would protect climate migrants and only those migrants. Nonetheless, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the difficulties underscore that it will not be easy to craft such a definition</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> Moreover, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>because of the multiplicity of factors influencing migration, it may not be possible in practice to ascribe many migration decisions to climate change</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>.</span> </p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>No backlash against immigrants – Canadian opinion is high.</div><div class='cite'>Stephen Smith 3-22-2018 – Reporter for the Canada Immigration Newsletter.

From the Liberal perspective, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has lately reafﬁrmed his old warning of a populist backlash unless government policy reduces economic inequality. And, further left, MP Charlie Angus launched a bid for the NDP leadership last month by urging his party to redeﬁne itself in opposition to Trump-style populism.</p><p>All this attention to populism takes on a real-world urgency in light of what’s been happening—among other places on the Canada-U.S. border—along that stretch of the 49th parallel separating Manitoba from Minnesota, mentioned in the House by Falk. <span class='card-underline'>It’s there, as most Canadians have heard in news reports, that undocumented migrants have been crossing by the dozen—often trekking for hours across snowy ﬁelds in bitter cold—to leave Trump’s America</span> behind and take their chances with Canada’s refugee process, maybe after warming up ﬁrst over coffee at Little Jay’s Café in Emerson, Man.

Broadly speaking, though, the term is used most often these days to capture what happens when politicians on the right tap anxieties over mass migrations, linking those fears with underlying discontent over scarce jobs and stagnant wages for less-educated workers. In other words, populism means Trump’s rise in the U.S., the Brexit referendum vote to pull Britain out of the European Union and the serious challenges various right-wing parties pose in a string of European elections set for this year.</p><p>Could that same recipe be cooked up in Canada? <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Trudeau’s election triumph in 2015, followed by his celebrated welcome of more than 40,000 Syrian refugees in 2016, had many observers portraying Canada as almost uniquely immune</span></span> to the inward-turning instinct behind Trump and Brexit.</p><p>Yet Frank Graves, the veteran Ekos pollster, has tracked and quantiﬁed similar strong currents coursing through Canadian conservatism. “<span class='card-underline'>The idea that a populist leader couldn’t win in Canada, that we couldn’t have an analogue to Trump, is I think nonsense</span>,” Graves says.</p><p>His public opinion research shows pessimism about the economic outlook and misgivings about diversity. For instance, Ekos polling found <span class='card-underline'>back in 1995 that 81 per cent of Canadians agreed that “cultural diversity”</span> contributed positively to Canadian identity. Asked the same question <span class='card-underline'>early last year, only 66 per cent rated diversity as having a positive impact</span>.</p><p>Then there’s economic unease.

And presented with the statement “<span class='card-underline'>If the current patterns of stagnation among all except those at the very top continue, I would not be surprised to see the emergence of violent class conﬂicts</span>,” Ekos found that 57 per cent of Canadians agreed.</p><p>Combine hopelessness about economic prospects with a magniﬁed sense of the risks out there in the world, and Graves says <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the result is, among some Canadians, a growing hankering for more order—even a tendency to accept authoritarianism</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>.</span></p><p>“That type of outlook is much more receptive to the idea that we need a strongman who’s going to make decisive government actions to deal with this,” he says. “So he’s going to build a wall, or he’s going to deport illegal immigrants, or he’s going to bomb enemies.”</p><p>Graves is careful to stress that being primed to accept right-wing populist messages isn’t a majority mindset in Canada. These tendencies are, not surprisingly, by far most pronounced among avowed Conservative voters, and particularly in places like Alberta. Which raises the question of how the Conservative party—and its 14 aspiring leaders—might adjust in the Trump era.</p><p>Other researchers also point to Canadian attitudes that appear receptive to a Trump-like message. For a recent McGill Institute for the Study of Canada conference in Montreal, University of Toronto political science professor Michael Donnelly analyzed an online survey of 1,522 Canadians conducted by the polling ﬁrm Ipsos and found scant evidence that Canada is particularly big-hearted when it comes to outsiders who want in.</p><p>Donnelly reported that <span class='card-underline'>when Canadians were asked how much they agree or disagree with the statement “The government should be generous in judging people’s applications for refugee status,” their tendency to be generous ranked a middling ninth out of 22 countries</span>. Canadian generosity only outranked Britain’s by a notch, and was just modestly ahead of Germany—both countries widely regarded as having struggled to accept immigrants. “<span class='card-underline'>Whatever is driving Canada’s exceptionally positive history of immigration and integration over the past half century</span>,” Donnelly concluded, “<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>it does not appear to be an exceptionally tolerant public</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>.”</span></p><p>Note that he didn’t say, however, that Canada’s world-famous reputation for integrating newcomers is undeserved—only that it can’t be chalked up mainly to national niceness. Perhaps <span class='card-underline'>the most persuasive case for why Canada really does better than the U.S. and most European countries when it comes to fostering diversity has come from researchers who focus not on Canadians’ attitudes, but on Canada’s immigration policies and the political system</span>.</p><p>It starts with the demographic clout of Canada’s foreign-born voters. They made up 20.6 per cent of the total population in the 2011 census, the highest proportion among the G8 countries, far higher than the roughly 13 per cent in both the U.S. and Germany. It also matters that the vast majority of Canadian immigrants choose to live in big cities in Ontario, B.C., Quebec and Alberta.</p><p>University of Toronto political science professor Phil Triadaﬁlopoulos stresses how immigrants to Canada become voting citizens more quickly than in other Western democracies, and how potent their votes have become in Canadian elections. “They don’t remain outsiders,” Triadaﬁlopoulos says. “Politically, they become insiders very quickly.”</p><p>In an inﬂuential 2013 paper entitled “Immigration, Citizenship and Canada’s New Conservative Party,” Triadaﬁlopoulos and two co-authors, McMaster University’s Inder Marwah and Carleton University’s Stephen White, note that 84 per cent of eligible immigrants in Canada become citizens, compared to just 75 per cent in Australia, 56 per cent in Britain, and a mere 40 per cent in the U.S.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>They emphasize research showing that voting among immigrant Canadians roughly matches turnout rates among native-born Canadians, and</span> that <span class='card-underline'>immigrants are more likely than voters born here to pay attention to election news, including watching televised leaders’ debates</span>.</p><p>Even more crucially, <span class='card-underline'>immigrants in Canada tend to cluster</span><span class='card-underline'>﻿﻿</span><span class='card-underline'> in Toronto and Vancouver</span>, in what most political party election strategists view as key ridings. “<span class='card-underline'>To alienate large numbers of immigrant voters in dozens of federal ridings would almost certainly mean surrendering those ridings to other parties</span>,” Triadaﬁlopoulos, Marwah and White write.</p><p>Still, they point to <span class='card-underline'>“grassroots conservative opinion” that often seems resistant to high levels of immigration and policies promoting multiculturalism</span>. That leads to what Triadaﬁlopoulos, Marwah and White dub a “populist’s paradox” facing right-of-centre Canadian political leaders, who must ﬁnd ways to speak to their base while also broadening their “ethnic” appeal.</p><p>It’s a dilemma that’s familiar to Preston Manning. He remembers coping with anti-immigrant bigots when he was leader of the upstart Reform party in the 1990s. “We had wild meetings,” Manning recalled in a recent interview. “Our ﬁrst week in the ’97 campaign, we had ‘Let the People Speak.’ It was like Russian roulette. I would get up there and say, ‘Rather than us telling you what this election is about, you’re going to tell us what it’s about.’ There would be some good, ordinary people, but there would always be some nutcase who’d get up.”</p><p>Manning says he would try to politely disavow the nutcase’s anti-immigrant (or sometimes anti-Quebec) ideas without denouncing the individual. He now heads the Calgary-based Manning Centre, which trains Conservative political operatives, conducts research and holds a key annual gathering of the Canadian right in Ottawa.</p><p>At this year’s conference, held in late February, Manning urged Conservatives to try to harness the energy of Trump-era populism, rather than only “denounce and decry” its dark side. Talking of grassroots Conservatives who worry that multiculturalism and immigration threaten “Canada’s national values and identity,” Manning advised against “contemptuously dismissing [their] concerns.”</p><p>But <span class='card-underline'>allowing anti-immigrant views any room to breathe has proven strategically risky</span>. Former Tory prime minister Stephen Harper laboured hard to make inroads among immigrant voters, relying largely on tireless outreach efforts by Jason Kenney (who has left federal politics and is now seeking the Alberta Progressive Conservative leadership). It paid off big in the Conservatives’ 2011 majority election win, which netted the Tories 32 of 47 seats in Toronto and its suburbs, where immigrants made up about half the population.</p><p>Then came the 2015 election reversal. Facing Trudeau’s challenge, the Conservatives stoked the part of their base that was alarmed by Islamic extremism or fundamentalism by proposing a ban on face veils during citizenship ceremonies, which Harper even said he would consider broadening to the federal public service. The Conservatives would also strip the Canadian citizenship of dual nationals convicted of terrorist offences and set up a “barbaric practices tip line.”</p><p>Chris Alexander, the former Conservative immigration minister who lost his Toronto-area seat in the 2015 election, later admitted that non-Muslim immigrant communities he didn’t anticipate would feel directly threatened by these controversial policies found them deeply unsettling. Those immigrant-heavy ridings swung almost entirely back to the Liberals.</p><p>“It was clear to me, and it’s even clearer in retrospect, that <span class='card-underline'>in urban Canada we were already in danger of being perceived as somehow an unwelcoming party</span>,” Alexander, who is now running for the federal Tory leadership, said in an interview. “That was, in my view, undeserved. But in political terms, it was a disaster.”</p><p>Are Conservatives inclined to ﬂirt with the same disaster again? Among the federal party’s 14 current leadership aspirants, Kellie Leitch, who proposes subjecting would-be immigrants to a Canadian “values test,” is clearly taking that gamble. She seems to be an outlier, though. Kevin O’Leary, seen by many as the race’s front-runner—and whose business and reality-TV resumé, and promises to slash taxes, invite Trump comparisons—shows zero inclination to mimic the president’s identity-politics blustering.</p><p>Tom Flanagan, a University of Calgary professor emeritus of political science and former Reform and Conservative campaign manager, says the Canadian way of selecting party leaders would likely frustrate an insurgency like Trump’s anyway. The U.S. primary system allows any American to vote for presidential nominees, so Trump was able to court votes from a broad, disaffected public. Canada’s next Conservative leader will be picked only by paid-up party members, which Flanagan says is a harder group for a risk-taking populist outsider to win over.</p><p>In any case, there’s just no Tory leadership aspirant who has the makings of a Canadian version of the current occupant of the White House. “Kellie Leitch is a very pallid imitation of Trump,” Flanagan says. “Kevin O’Leary isn’t even interested in the same kind of issues.”</p><p>If the Canadian election map makes taking an anti-immigrant line a losing proposition, and the Canadian way of choosing party leaders makes it hard for a populist outsider to win, there’s still the possibility that the Conservatives might try to activate the economic side of populism.</p><p>Even there, <span class='card-underline'>though, the formula behind Trump and Brexit doesn’t look like a natural ﬁt in Canada</span>. <span class='card-underline'>Trump blended his anti-immigrant rhetoric with promises to scrap or overhaul free-trade agreements. The Brexit forces linked discomfort with foreigners to resentment of the EU free-trading order</span>. But in Canada, liberalized trade enjoys broad buy-in—particularly on the political right, and notably in the Conservatives’ resource-exporting western strongholds.</p><p>So echoing Trump and the Brexiters in railing against unfair foreign competition is a non-starter for Canadian Conservatives. That leaves, perhaps, ﬁnding a way to give voice to the anxieties of that broad swath of Canadians who, as Graves portrays them, fear that the middle class is shrinking and that opportunities for their children and grandchildren are dwindling.</p><p>But the Tories would ﬁnd themselves playing catch-up with the Liberals when it comes to tailoring a populist message for those worried voters. Trudeau has been arguing since 2014 that failure to push income growth down from high-earners to middle-class families would eventually prompt a dangerous backlash. His answer, or at least part of it, came in last year’s budget, in the forms of a modest middle-income tax cut, an upper-income tax hike and a signiﬁcant boost in federal payments to parents.</p><p>Is more policy in the same vein coming in next month’s 2017 budget? In a signiﬁcant recent speech in Germany, at Hamburg’s annual St. Matthew’s Day Banquet, Trudeau strongly suggested he isn’t done trying salve that middle-class sense of grievance. “With the pace of globalization and technological change,” he said, “there is a very real fear out there that our kids will be worse off than we are.”</p><p>Adopting his own version of the populist line, Trudeau took direct aim at corporations that post record proﬁts but somehow can’t afford to offer job security to their workers. “Increasing inequality has made citizens distrust their governments, distrust their employers,” he added. “It turns into ‘us vs. them.’ ”</p><p>From the sounds of his Hamburg speech, Trudeau doesn’t intend to leave the next Conservative leader any easy opening to outdo him when it comes to giving voice to the disquiet of Canadians who believe the economic order is stacked against their families. It remains to be seen what additional policies the Liberals unveil in the upcoming budget to back up that rhetoric.</p><p>If Trudeau fails to deliver, a right-leaning populist might seize the chance to try to ﬁll the vacuum. Overall, though, <span class='card-underline'>the prospects for a right-of-</span><span class='card-underline'>centre</span><span class='card-underline'> populist movement in Canada look dim</span>, even though opinion in Canada, according to pollsters like Graves and academics like Donnelly, contains plenty of the same mix of fear and pessimism that fuelled Trump and Brexit.</p><p>There’s no shortage of Canadians who, if they’d heard Ted Falk wishing God’s blessing for Donald Trump, might well have said, “Amen.” <span class='card-underline'>But if they’re hoping that Trump-style populism will slip across the border and succeed in Canadian politics, they’re likely to discover that Canada’s welcoming reputation has its limits</span>.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'><span class='card-underline'>Canada’s refugee policy explicitly excludes climate refugees – they wouldn’t go to Canada anyways absent the plan</span></div><div class='cite'>Musampa ’17 – November 17, 2017, Benjamin Musampa holds an MA in International Law and International Politics from Universite de Sherbrooke, “How will Canada handle climate refugees?” https://cusjc.ca/bootcamp/o-zone/how-will-canada-handle-climate-refugees/ // shurst </div><div class='card-body'><p><span class='card-underline'>Abdul Kadir arrived in Canada</span> in 2007 after spending three years in a Kenyan refugee camp. <span class='card-underline'>Political instability and recurrent armed conflicts were the primary reasons</span> Kadir, now 55, left his country. <span class='card-underline'>But there was another, less obvious factor forcing him to flee: environmental disasters caused by human and natural forces</span>. “<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Food scarcity, the lack of infrastructure and the absence of rain falling … made my daily life very miserable and difficult to surviv</span></span><span class='card-underline'>e</span>,” Kadir said. Abdul Kadir sits in his office at Ottawa’s Somali Centre for Family Services. Kadir requested that his face not be shown in any photos. According to a report released by Oxfam, <span class='card-underline'>nearly 11 million people</span> like Kadir <span class='card-underline'>living around the Horn of Africa face severe hunger this year due to increased droughts caused by climate change and political conflict.</span> International bodies such as the United Nations have warned that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the number of environmental migrants is likely to rise worldwide due to climate change</span></span>. Political instability and <span class='card-underline'>the inefficiency of national and subnational institutions</span> in Somalia has <span class='card-underline'>result</span>ed <span class='card-underline'>in</span> a <span class='card-underline'>slow response to drought-related issues</span>. The ministries of forestry, livestock, health and social services have all been reported as corrupt and dysfunctional. Because these institutions are ill-equipped to tackle Somalia’s chronic vulnerabilities to floods, droughts and food insecurity, many citizens find themselves without clean water and other vital resources. Luisa Veronis, an associate professor at the University of Ottawa, has studied the environmental influences on African migration to Canada. She said that the depletion of Somalia’s natural resources as a result of climate change and political conflict is worse than in any other African country. University of Ottawa professor Luisa Veronis addresses environmental issues in immigration policy Somali participants in her study identified deforestation as a major environmental concern in their home country. Wood is needed for cooking and for charcoal production, and deforestation has led to competition between pastoralists attempting to grab any remaining vegetation to feed their animals during droughts. Often Somalis have no choice but to abandon everything and escape these precarious conditions, hoping to reach one of the refugee camps located in neighbouring countries like Kenya. “While living in a refugee camp in Kenya, life was harsh, very hard, no water, no shelter, no sanitations,” Kadir recalled. Kadir was very happy to begin his new life in Canada after he was accepted as a political refugee. He quickly found a well-established Somali community in the Ottawa-Gatineau region. Somalis are the largest community among African-descent immigrants living in Ottawa with 11,000 people. But not all those seeking to escape Somalia will have a chance to settle in Canada. Earlier this month, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the Canadian government unveiled a new immigration plan which aims to bring in an additional one million people over the next three years. However, </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>there is nothing in the policy to help people fleeing environmental challenges</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>in countries like Somalia. “People in Somalia who suffer from these ongoing problems simply do not have access to Canada’s immigration system unless they are fortunate enough to have a close family member or other potential sponsor already established there,” Veronis said. If they don’t meet the requirements for immigration, people like Kadir might think to turn to the refugee system, which is designed as humanitarian relief for those fleeing persecution or war. He succeeded in getting to Canada on political grounds. But <span class='card-underline'>the Canadian refugee program does not currently recognize environmental migrants as a distinct category</span>. In February, the Refugee Research Network and the Centre for Refugee Studies at York University issued a policy brief calling for the development of a national policy in the area of international environment migration. So far, that has not happened. Abdul Kadir may have been able to escape his life in Somalia and come to Canada, but there are many like him who cannot under the current immigration and refugee system.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>The threat of secession is gone. </div><div class='cite'>Reg Whitaker, adjunct professor at the University of Victoria and a Distinguished Research Professor Emeritus at York University, August 24, 2002, Toronto Star</div><div class='card-body'><p><span class='card-underline'>Chretien will</span> no doubt <span class='card-underline'>be ranked as one of </span><span class='card-underline'>Canada</span><span class='card-underline'>'s more successful prime ministers</span>.

However, <span class='card-underline'>if we turn our attention from shrill political rhetoric to economic fundamentals, we find that the eurozone economy </span><span class='card-underline'>as a whole today</span><span class='card-underline'> is </span><span class='card-underline'>more resilient</span><span class='card-underline'> than in 2012</span>, the last time that Grexit risk was being discussed. <span class='card-underline'>We measure the </span><span class='card-underline'>underlying stability</span><span class='card-underline'> of the euro area by looking at the sustainability of public finances, private and foreign debt levels as well as developments in employment, productivity and competitiveness</span>. By collating such numbers into a single indicator, we get an early warning signal for macroeconomic imbalances in the eurozone. <span class='card-underline'>At the moment</span><span class='card-underline'>, our warning indictor is </span><span class='card-underline'>not flashing red</span><span class='card-underline'> – at least not if we look at </span><span class='card-underline'>the eurozone as a whole</span><span class='card-underline'>.

Several euro countries that used to have gaping external deficits now run current-account surpluses. Importantly, <span class='card-underline'>improvements on the external front are increasingly driven by </span><span class='card-underline'>genuine competitiveness gains</span><span class='card-underline'>: a favorable unit labor cost trend and gradually recovering domestic demand are evidence that external surpluses are not solely the result of demand compression but that structural reforms are bearing fruit</span>. <span class='card-underline'>Progress has also been notable in the area of debt. Debt ratios have declined for governments, private households and non-financial enterprises</span> – although the absolute stock of debt remains very high. On the other hand, our ratings are abysmal when it comes to unemployment, which still stands at 11.6% across the eurozone. We also worry about the fact that eurozone exports, on average, are not gaining global market shares. This is a reminder that measures of economic stability can differ markedly from those of economic dynamism. While the eurozone as a whole looks more resilient, there are, of course, big differences between the member countries. There is still a noticeable split between what economists have come to refer to as the core and the periphery of the eurozone. Austria, Germany, Luxembourg, Estonia and Latvia look very balanced. They tend to have stable public finances, low private debt, few external imbalances and they mostly manage to defend their shares in global markets. The (former) program countries, Greece, Portugal, Spain and Ireland, all have some way to catch up. Greece still brings up the rear in our ranking (only Cyprus scores even worse). Greece has cut its budget deficit and regained competitiveness, but it remains vulnerable because of its mountainous debts, mass unemployment and rigid labor and product markets. Although other peripheral countries are on the right track, they still have their own problems. Portugal, for example, is struggling with the highest interest rate burden in the eurozone, while Spain’s unemployment rate is still 24%. Both factors make it harder to get debt and deficits under control. Fiscal policy is also Italy’s Achilles’ heel. Public debt stands at over 130% of GDP and although the Italian government borrows more cheaply these days than the US Treasury, this might leave the country vulnerable to a sudden deterioration in market sentiment. Italy’s debt burden looks particularly daunting, given its low scores on employment, productivity and competitiveness. Although France’s economic malaise has been much discussed, in terms of economic stability, the country ranks in mid-field – disappointing but not overly vulnerable. Fiscal indicators look steady but have not improved. France’s ongoing loss of world market share stores up trouble for the future. <span class='card-underline'>To assess the resilience of the eurozone, we do not look only at how solid individual member countries are. </span><span class='card-underline'>The broader framework also matters</span>.

Riyadh’s Jan. 2 execution of Shiite cleric Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, amid Tehran’s protestations, brought the worsening tension to a head. Indeed, Saudi Arabia’s decision to cut ties with Iran after its diplomatic facilities were stormed by Iranian protesters, with countries such as Sudan, Somalia, Bahrain and Djibouti soon following suit, brought about a novel state in the Iranian-Saudi relationship. In this atmosphere, media pundits are asking whether it is possible that Tehran and Riyadh may enter direct military confrontation.

Therefore, while some Saudi leaders may beat the drums of escalation, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the possibility of outright war depends on factors such as whether there is political will for such action and how</span></span> the two <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>countries choose to handle the crisis in their relations. In sum, engaging in war is not something that can be done by one side alone</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> Moreover, Iran’s government has no incentive to increase tensions, as evidenced by the condemnation of the attack on the Saudi Embassy in Tehran by the triangle of power in Iranian foreign policy, meaning Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Rouhani and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. In a goodwill effort, Iran has also announced that it will continue to send pilgrims to Saudi Arabia for the hajj this year. Thus, if Saudi Arabia intends to initiate war, the Iranian public — seeing themselves as victims of a violation — will mobilize, and also gain the sympathy of the international community. <span class='card-underline'>Second, </span><span class='card-underline'>the majority of</span> Iran’s <span class='card-underline'>current leaders were involved in the destructive war with Iraq and are fully aware of its costs. </span>Rouhani held several military positions during the conflict, while Zarif and his deputies also remember the hardships of that era in their capacity as diplomats. Khamenei, who was president at that time, also served as chairman of the Supreme Defense Council, while Rafsanjani served as the de facto commander-in-chief of the Iranian military. Even Iran’s parliament speaker, Ali Larijani, served as a commander with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Larijani’s brothers, including incumbent judiciary chief Sadegh Larijani, were also involved in the conflict. Many other influential Iranian figures, including a great number of parliamentarians and Friday prayer leaders, also have bitter memories of war, some of them as war veterans. Moreover, although the IRGC at times seems to favor showdowns — such as in the cases of the recent detention of US sailors or its surveillance of the aircraft carrier USS Harry Truman in the Persian Gulf — it is not empowered to take arbitrary actions. <span class='card-underline'>Third, the very nature of the current crisis makes war unlikely.</span> According to Charles Hermann, a renowned analyst of issues related to US foreign policy, crisis management and decision-making, <span class='card-underline'>what defines a crisis are the three elements of threat, time and surprise. Whether the situation threatens the vital interests of a state allows only a short time for decision-making, and whether it occurs as a surprise to policymakers must all be considered. When it comes to Iran and Saudi Arabia, the nature of their crisis does not meet </span><span class='card-underline'>this criteria</span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> In fact, Saudi Arabia’s tone against Iran has even softened in recent weeks. Indeed, Saudi Deputy Crown Prince and Minister of Defense Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud recently told The Economist, “Whoever is pushing toward [war with Iran] is somebody who is not in their right mind.” Fourth, on the international level, Saudi Arabia believes that in the event of a military confrontation with Iran, the United States and the rest of the West may side with the Islamic Republic. Riyadh’s decision to cut ties with Tehran has received virtually no international support aside from some African countries that play no significant role in international power equations. Even US Secretary of State John Kerry has urged calm following the breakdown in the Saudi-Iranian relationship. There may have been a time when, because of Saudi Arabia’s oil or its position, Washington would have gone out of its way to serve the interests of Riyadh. However, now, even some US elites view Saudi Arabia as a slightly more civilized version of the Islamic State. <span class='card-underline'>Last but not least</span><span class='card-underline'>, victory is uncertain</span> in a potential Iranian-Saudi war. Saudi Arabia and Iran may take destructive blows from each other, but <span class='card-underline'>both know that neither </span><span class='card-underline'>has the ability to</span><span class='card-underline'> destroy the other side or impose regime change.</span> Saudi Arabia has more warplanes and modern military equipment, while Iran has better missile capabilities and military personnel. Riyadh’s involvement in the Yemen war is another factor that reduces the motivation for war with Tehran. Moreover, the population in Saudi Arabia’s oil-rich Eastern Province is mainly Shiite and has the potential to revolt — an advantage for Tehran that Riyadh cannot easily create for itself in Iran. Lastly, Iran’s control of the Strait of Hormuz, through which Saudi Arabia conducts much of its trade, is a further preventative factor, since war would necessitate redirecting all that trade to the Red Sea, which in the short run is just not possible.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Water scarcity makes violence and instability inevitable</div><div class='cite'>Ahmed 15- Nafeez, bestselling author, investigative journalist and international security scholar, New Age Of Water Wars Portends ‘Bleak Future’ For The Middle East, (http://www.mintpressnews.com/new-age-of-water-wars-portends-bleak-future-for-the-middle-east/203712/) JB</div><div class='card-body'><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Behind the escalating violence in Iraq, Syria and Yemen, as well as the epidemic of civil unrest across the wider region, is a growing shortage of water.

Washington collects allies like most people collect Facebook "friends." <span class='card-underline'>The vast majority of</span><span class='card-underline'> U.S. allies are security </span><span class='card-underline'>liabilities</span><span class='card-underline'>, tripwires for conflict and war</span>. Perhaps even worse, American officials constantly abase themselves, determined to reassure the very countries which the U.S. is defending at great cost and risk. Indeed, America's most hawkish politicians, who routinely posture like reincarnations of Winston Churchill, routinely talk of sacrificing U.S. lives, wealth, and security for the benefit of other nations. For instance, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fl.) recently worried, "What ally around the world can feel safe in their alliance with us?" The more relevant question should be with what ally can America feel safe? Instead of relentlessly collecting more international dependents, Washington policymakers should drop Allies In Name Only (AINOs). <span class='card-underline'>The U.S. should return to a more traditional standard for alliances: Join with other nations only when doing so advances American security. Alas, that </span><span class='card-underline'>rarely is the case today</span>. Indeed, contra the scare-mongering of hawkish politicians such as Sen. Rubio and his GOP compatriots, the strategic environment today is remarkably benign for the U.S. The world is messy, to be sure, but that's always been the case. <span class='card-underline'>The number of big conflicts is down</span>. More important, <span class='card-underline'>America faces no hegemonic threat or peer competitor</span> and is allied with every major industrialized state other than China and Russia. <span class='card-underline'>All of Washington's recent wars have been over</span> -- from America's standpoint -- <span class='card-underline'>unimportant, indeed, sometimes frivolous stakes. The Islamic State, Libya and Iraq were regional problems for U.S. allies with </span><span class='card-underline'>minimal impact on America</span><span class='card-underline'>. Iran and North Korea are ugly actors, but mostly for Washington's dependents. The two would face </span><span class='card-underline'>destruction if they attacked America</span>. The latest crisis du jour, Yemen, worries Riyadh but is not even a speed bump for the globe's sole superpower. Yet Washington now is involved in another sectarian proxy war through its totalitarian "ally" Saudi Arabia. <span class='card-underline'>Terrorism remains a genuine </span><span class='card-underline'>threat, but</span><span class='card-underline'> falls far short of the sort of existential danger posed by the Soviet Union</span> during the Cold War. Worse, terrorism typically is a response to foreign intervention and occupation. Washington has inadvertently encouraged terrorism by backing authoritarian regimes, joining foreign conflicts, and creating enemies overseas. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>America has done some of the worst damage to itself when protecting the interests of allies -- fighting their wars, killing their enemies, backing their campaigns, advancing their interests</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Adding unnecessary allies obviously makes this problem worse</span></span>. In Ukraine, for instance, the Obama administration is under pressure to treat a non-ally as an ally -- arming and/or defending Russia's neighbor -- which would yield a proxy war with Russia, a nuclear-armed state which considers border security a vital interest. Bringing Ukraine (and Georgia) into NATO would be even more dangerous, inviting a geopolitical game of chicken over minimal stakes. Neither country has ever been considered even a marginal security concern of America. In contrast, both were long ruled by Moscow, which sees their links to the West as a form of encirclement, capping the extension of NATO up to Russia's borders. Of course, both nations have been treated unfairly and badly by Moscow. But that doesn't justify a military alliance with the U.S. <span class='card-underline'>Alliances should be based on interest, not charity</span>. They should not be an end, an independent security interest, but a means to an end, to protect America. Adding troubled states with limited military capabilities and unresolved conflicts turns the purpose of alliances on their head. The U.S. long eschewed alliances and other "foreign entanglements," against which George Washington had warned. Even in World War I, a foolish imperial slugfest of no concern to America, Woodrow Wilson brought in the U.S. only as an "associated power." Popular and congressional opposition then prevented Wilson from guaranteeing the allied powers' post-war territorial seizures. Nevertheless, Washington's involvement was a catastrophic mistake, making possible the Versailles Treaty, which turned out to be only a generational truce before the combatants returned to fight a second and far bloodier round. The extraordinary circumstances of World War II led to a genuine and justifiable alliance. During the Cold War the U.S. created what were intended to be temporary alliances. This policy was justified by the vulnerability of America's war-ravaged friends and hostility of the great communist powers, China and the Soviet Union. But even Dwight Eisenhower warned against turning the Europeans into permanent dependents. It makes no sense for Washington to retain responsibility for defending a continent with a larger economy and population than America -- and vastly greater resources than its only serious potential threat, Russia. Much the same has happened in Asia, which Washington filled with allies after World War II. Even as Japan became the world's second economic power Tokyo relied on the American military. South Korea now has 40 times the GDP and twice the population of the North, yet Washington is responsible for the South's defense. The problem is not just wasted resources, but tripwires for war. Alliances deter, but they also ensure involvement if deterrence fails, as it often does. And lending smaller states the services of a superpower's military changes their behavior, causing them to be more confrontational, even reckless. America and China aren't likely to come to blows over, say, Hawaii, which Beijing has no intention of attacking. But conflict could erupt over irrelevant allied territorial disputes, such as the Senkaku Islands and Scarborough Reef, claimed by Japan and the Philippines, respectively, and China. Unfortunately, commitments to marginal allies determine basic U.S. defense strategy. Should America be prepared to fight one, one and a half, two, or more wars at once? These prospective conflicts invariably involve allies, not America directly. After all, what state can actually harm the U.S.? Other than Russia (and to a much more limited degree China) with its ICBMs, there is none. If war comes, it will involve Korea, Japan, the Persian Gulf, or Europe. The greater the number of dependent allies, the larger the number of possible wars. But when the interests involved are unimportant and the nations involved are capable of defending themselves, why is Washington sacrificing its people's lives and wealth for other states? The U.S. should start defenestrating AINOs. Most of these nations would remain close. With all of them commerce should be free, culture should be shared, people should be friends, and governments should cooperate. In some cases military coordination may be called for, when the U.S. and other nations share vital objectives. However, Washington should stop defending South Korea. With an overwhelming resource advantage, the South should deter North Korean adventurism and build cooperative regional relationships to preserve security in Northeast Asia. Despite historic tensions, Seoul should build ties with Japan, another American dependent which should transcend the past and create a military sufficient constrain a growing China. Washington should base relationships on equality rather than dependence. <span class='card-underline'>The U.S. also should end its European defense dole. Today, NATO is effectively North America and the Others. Yet the Europeans collectively are wealthier and more populous than the U.S. They should </span><span class='card-underline'>take over NATO</span><span class='card-underline'> or set up their own alliance</span>. No doubt there still would be important occasions for Washington to work militarily with these nations, which share history and values. But they, not America, should secure Europe.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>NATO fails—the alliance is in shambles</div><div class='cite'>Grady ‘16 - John Grady, a former managing editor of Navy Times, retired as director of communications for the Association of the United States Army.

Those simultaneous crises were at the heart of Friday forum on a new Atlantic Council report looking at six nations in NATO and the challenges they and the alliance face and what can be done to meet them. In answer to a question, Julianne Smith of the Center for a New American Security said the time is ripe for closer cooperation between the alliance and the European Union in meeting those challenges and other threats, such as cyber and communications. “We need the capabilities that both institutions can bring to bear.” But <span class='card-underline'>what is happening is that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>NATO is becoming even more a “</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>two-tiered alliance</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>”</span></span><span class='card-underline'> with the eastern members looking at Moscow’s willingness to battle Georgia over breakaway provinces, its seizure of Crimea, and continuing military support of separatists in Eastern Ukraine as a serious military threat— while southern members confront a rising flood of refugees and migrants fleeing wars in the Middle East</span> and poverty there, in North and sub-Saharan Africa. Smith said, “<span class='card-underline'>There is no longer the level of solidarity we once saw</span>” <span class='card-underline'>in NATO and the European Union and a growing feeling on the continent that the two are </span><span class='card-underline'>not responsive to the public’s needs to meet these challenges</span>. As a sign of that fraying, she said later that although sanctions against Russia will likely be extended later this year some alliance and union “countries are really feeling the pain” and looking for relief of their own. “The threats against Portugal are not the same” as those Lithuania faces, said Andras Simonyi, a retired Hungarian diplomat now with Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced and International Studies. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The idea that the United States will always rise to the occasion in meeting the continent’s security needs “</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>made Europe complacent</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>”</span></span><span class='card-underline'> ever since the collapse of the Soviet Union</span> in the early 1990s and the alliance expanded eastward, he added. What has happened in their harvesting of the “peace dividend” is that “<span class='card-underline'>many </span><span class='card-underline'>militaries in the alliance are in pretty bad shape</span>,” he said. <span class='card-underline'>As an example of </span><span class='card-underline'>reduced readiness</span><span class='card-underline'>, even among nations presumed to have strong militaries</span>, Jorge Benitez of th<span class='card-underline'>e Atlantic Council noted that the United Kingdom had great difficulty fielding a combat-ready armored brigade to a recent exercise in Poland</span>, having to draw on equipment it had in Canada for training. While the report and panel members agreed that alliance members on the continent needed to do more to provide for their own security, <span class='card-underline'>there is “</span><span class='card-underline'>no consensus</span><span class='card-underline'> in Europe that a permanent presence [by the United States or NATO in the Baltics, for example] is a good idea,”</span> Smith said. To many, “a persistent presence is good enough for us.” The author of the United Kingdom’s section of the report, however, recommended stationing a corps-sized headquarters and three brigades in the Baltics to deter Russian aggression in that part of Europe. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>All agreed that </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>simply spending 2 percent on defense was not the right approach</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> to enhancing continental security</span></span>.

Creating a strong, diverse STEM-ready workforce is essential to economic and social prosperity and we all have a role to play in this critical effort.” According to the National Survey of College Graduates, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the number of U.S. jobs that require substantial expertise in STEM has </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>increased</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> nearly </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>34 percent over the past decade</span></span>. While the number of Americans with a four-year degree in science and engineering (S&E) grew by 53 percent between 2000 and 2014; in China, this number increased by 360 percent. U.S leadership in global S&E is being challenged. The NSB’s statement reflects the Board’s strong conviction that a diverse STEM-capable U.S. workforce that leverages the talents of all segments of our population is more important than ever. It notes that <span class='card-underline'>we now live in a global economy where knowledge reigns, and so we must do all we can to ensure that our people can succeed and contribute to the well-being of our country</span>. The new policy companion statement addresses the need to grow a STEM-capable U.S. workforce that leverages the talents of people at all education levels and in all sectors. It not only includes traditional scientists and engineers performing research in university, government, or industry labs, but also “skilled technical workers” who can install, repair, debug, and build, but do not have a four-year degree. This skilled technical workforce includes a large, diverse group of workers that are crucial components of almost every sector of the U.S. economy, from “blue collar” occupations--such as installation, maintenance, and repair--to healthcare and computer jobs. In the early 1990s, the National Science Foundation (NSF) created the Advanced Technological Education program (ATE) targeted at strengthening the skilled technical workforce. To date, the program has awarded more than $950 million to 492 distinct institutions, with more than 65 percent of the awards going to two-year degree granting institutions. In 2016, recognizing the need to enhance U.S. leadership in science and engineering discovery, NSF launched the Inclusion across the Nation of Communities of Learners of Underrepresented Discoverers in Engineering and Science (INCLUDES) program. INCLUDES aims to expand the composition of the STEM-capable workforce by developing scalable ways to grow it by building new and strengthening existing partnerships. This is a comprehensive initiative that seeks and develops STEM talent from all sectors and groups in our society. The Board’s statement points out that STEM is not just for elite institutions or for researchers with advanced degrees--it’s for all Americans. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Building the U.S. workforce of the future requires that all segments of our population have access to affordable, high-quality education and training opportunities beginning as early as kindergarten and lasting well beyond graduation</span></span>.

I basically believe that as long as the Pentagon is still buying two manned fighter planes after the unmanned revolution, there is more than enough money going to the Defense Department—because if money were really tight, one or both of those programs would be cancelled, and the military services would be undercutting each other's budgets to increase the funding available for their priorities. As long as adaptation to obvious next-generation platforms (like unmanned aerial fighters) remains this slow and the services placidly accept their budget shares, the topline is adequate. But even <span class='card-underline'>I am now nervous about the widening gap between America’s military obligations and the resourcing we are committing. What’s worsening the situation is that the Trump administration is both expanding requirements and contracting spending.</span> Since taking office, President Trump and his defense secretary have approved an increase in both forces and operational tempo in the fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria; committed to an enduring presence in Iraq after the defeat of ISIS; are considering an imminent increase of at least 4,000 troops to Afghanistan as part of the advise and assist mission to Afghan National Security Forces; are reviewing an Afghan war strategy that could make weightier demands of long duration to that country; have increased the military assets assigned to deter and if necessary engage North Korea; are providing greater intelligence and special-operations support to allied operations in Yemen; and are pushing back assertively on Iranian naval activity. Those are non-trivial expansions of demand to place on an already over-stretched force. Chief of Staff of the Army, General Mark Milley, assesses current requirements at 540,000 active-duty soldiers, which appears to be the Army’s favorite round number: It was also what the Army believed it needed in the mid-1990s, and what the Army believed it needed mid-term of the Obama administration. So it’s likely an institutionally comfortable number rather than a rigorously derived one. Still, the 540,000 number cannot reasonably meet the very different demands of those three time frames. Planners at the end of the Cold War envisioned a strategic environment that entailed Russia integrating into the West, did not imagine the emergence of global terrorist threats, and under-emphasized the rise of an aggressive China as America’s peer. The early-2000s assessments were based on a Russia reset, the tide of wars receding, and China as a responsible stakeholder; none of those three planning parameters hold. Even without factoring in the president’s policies, objectively the international environment is increasing demands. <span class='card-underline'>The president’s budget allots only a 3-percent increase in the coming fiscal year DOD spending.</span> When out-year projections are taken into account, the Trump budget will add only $463-billion increase through 2027. <span class='card-underline'>Despite political grandstanding about the “historic” size of the increase and a pledge to rebuild America’s armed forces, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>that is a very modest bump, probably inadequate even to rebuild current readiness shortfalls</span></span>. Moreover, the Trump budget would drastically reduce the congressionally-approved slush fund called Overseas Contingency Operations. The OCO funds are off-budget, so are unconstrained by the Budget Control Act ceilings, and currently funnel an additional $64 billion to Defense. Despite Defense Secretary James Mattis testifying that preserving OCO funding was one of his top five budget priorities, the president’s budget would reduce the funding to only $12 billion by the end of the five-year Future Years Defense Program. To make matters worse, the president has offered up a budget there is no reasonable possibility the Congress will enact, because it both exceeds BCA caps by $52 billion and pays for the modest increase in defense spending by violating the mandated dollar for dollar balance between domestic and defense spending. The former chair of the House Appropriations Committee, Republican Hal Rodgers, called it “politically impossible.” Mattis testified that his own budget fails to fund $33 billion in needed spending. One bleak interpretation of the White House’s intention is that the administration is seeking to make it safe for Republicans to vote in favor of budgets that increase deficit spending. Under this theory, in order to get increases in defense, conservatives would swallow their concern about the debt and agree to increases in domestic spending. In short, the administration would be betting on budget hawks abjuring their principles. They would also be setting DOD up to be the villain as the only government activity whose spending is increasing, and that at the cost of other national priorities. There is, of course, no reason <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Congress</span></span> needs to pay any attention to the president’s budget submission.

The Bush and the Obama administrations prioritized America’s outreach to India and negotiated key agreements in trade and nuclear and military cooperation. Now, <span class='card-underline'>the challenge is to build on this important bipartisan achievement </span><span class='card-underline'>to create an even closer U.S.–India relationship</span>. Closer economic ties. Trade has transformed U.S.–India relations. “Bilateral trade has more than doubled in the last decade from $45 billion in 2006 to more than $114 billion in 2016,” as the State Department’s Alice Wells recently told Congress. In 2014, President Obama and Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged to increase U.S.–India trade fivefold, and in the past two years, U.S. foreign direct investment in India has grown 500 percent. However, <span class='card-underline'>U.S.–India trade remains far short of its full potential</span>. The president promised in his State of the Union address Tuesday that “we will work to fix bad trade deals and negotiate new ones.” If he is serious, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the president should negotiate a bilateral investment treaty to further promote U.S.–India trade</span></span>. For comparison: Joshua Meltzer and Harsha Singh of the Brookings Institution note that trade between America and South Korea is twice as large as that between America and India, even though South Korea’s economy is 40 percent smaller than India’s. <span class='card-underline'>Another vital step for the administration is to support India’s effort to join the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC).</span> India has sought to join APEC for more than 20 years, and in 2010 the organization lifted a moratorium on new members. Despite this, Washington has not seized the opportunity to support New Delhi. “<span class='card-underline'>India in APEC would help offset the now overwhelming influence of the Chinese economy,”</span> writes Alyssa Ayres of the Council on Foreign Relations, “<span class='card-underline'>while also embedding India in a forum that would nudge it toward further economic reform.</span>” For his part, Prime Minister Modi took office in 2014 promising ambitious economic reforms. He quickly unveiled his “Make in India” initiative to boost the country’s manufacturing sector from 17 percent of the country’s GDP to 25 percent over the next decade. Recently, India introduced a goods and services tax to replacing existing state and local levies in favor of a common national tax. Overall, however, Modi’s policies have fallen fall short of his promises. As the 2019 Indian election approaches, he should not shy away from pursuing dramatic structural reforms. Derek Scissors of the American Enterprise Institute recommends allowing Indian manufacturers to hire more people, privatizing banks, improving market access, and permitting full private ownership of land. Indeed, while India is expected to become the world’s fifth-largest economy this year, there is still much New Delhi can do to promote economic growth. As Wells noted, India still has “significant tariff and non-tariff barriers, subsidies, localization policies, restrictions on investment, and intellectual property concerns that limit market access and impede U.S. exporters and businesses from entering the Indian market.” The Commerce Department reports that India has levied an array of tariffs on U.S. goods such as medical equipment, automobiles and motorcycles, rubber, alcoholic beverages, and textiles. What makes this particularly frustrating is that “India has considerable flexibility to change tariff rates at any time,” leaving U.S. exporters with tremendous uncertainty. If U.S.–India trade is to meet its full potential, then the relationship needs to be rooted in policies that are free and fair. <span class='card-underline'>Increasing military cooperation. Just as trade is bringing the United States and India together economically, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>China’s military actions are bringing them together strategically</span></span>. Sales of U.S. military equipment to India have gone from zero to $15 billion in ten years. Already, the United States sells India transport and maritime patrol aircraft, anti-ship missiles, and helicopters. But, <span class='card-underline'>with the </span><span class='card-underline'>declaration</span><span class='card-underline'> of India as a “major defense partner” in 2016, the administration can </span><span class='card-underline'>offer even more systems for sale</span><span class='card-underline'>, such as drone and fighter aircraft and aircraft-carrier technologies</span>. Just as trade is bringing the United States and India together economically, China’s military actions are bringing them together strategically. Last fall, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson detailed the administration’s “vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific, supported and protected by two strong pillars of democracy — the United States and India.” But to achieve that aim, Washington and New Delhi must further enhance their defense cooperation. <span class='card-underline'>The end goal of this cooperation</span>, says James Carafano of the Heritage Foundation, <span class='card-underline'>is to craft a unique strategic relationship</span>, “one <span class='card-underline'>that delivers the benefits of allied status</span> without the formal architecture that goes with it.” Finally, as China’s military power grows, U.S. allies in the Pacific are increasing their security cooperation with the United States and each other. The Trump administration should help further incorporate India into this emerging quadrilateral relationship between themselves, Japan, and Australia. Washington, Ashley Tellis of the Carnegie Endowment says, should “actively encourage consultations, exercises, liaison relationships, and even defense procurement among any combination of partners within this ‘Quad.’” By working together to defend their common interests, the Quad can advance a shared vision of an Indo-Pacific that is free from coercion and intimidation. Conclusion. In 2000, Indian prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee declared that his country and the United States are “natural allies.” But, as President Trump said when unveiling his national-security strategy: “Success is not a forgone conclusion. It must be earned.” <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Trump and Modi should take the difficult steps now to fulfill their predecessors’ visions of a close U.S.–Indian economic and military relationship</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span></p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'><span class='card-highlight'>The Republic of India should join the One Belt and One Road Initiative.</span>

Pakistan plays a significant role in China’s Maritime Silk Route as part of China’s Belt and Road initiative (BRI). The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is a vital development project within China’s Belt Road Initiative (BRI) and serves as the crucial link between the maritime ‘road’ and land based ‘belt’ aspects of the BRI. India perceives China’s Maritime Silk route passing through South Asia as a direct threat to its core strategic interest in the Indian Ocean as it wants to maintain Indian primacy in the Indian Ocean (IO) and Indian Ocean Littoral States. Indian leaders have strong aspirations to be a blue water navy or the dominant naval power in the Indian Ocean since its inception in 1947. Indian Researcher Anit Mukherjee determines the Indian Ocean strategy in three categories. One is to establish closer ties with the US and its allies, second is to strengthen its links with Indian Ocean Littoral states and last is to build up its own military power (including the induction of nuclear capable submarines into the Indian Ocean). Indian Ocean Region (IOR) is the coastal area (consists of islands and states) lying in contact with the IO. It has become a renewed focal point of global economy, having substantial avenues for economic activities of Asia, US, and Europe. Therefore, all stakeholders are obliged to ensure the security of the Indian Ocean in order to avoid any miscalculation or misperception among all stake holders. Moreover, <span class='card-underline'>China is expected to be the world’s largest oil importing country and India is expected to be the largest coal importing country by 2020; therefore, there is an inevitable need for their cooperative efforts to ensure security</span>. On the other hand, the enlargement of the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) in the IOR is primarily due to the large economic incentives. China has transported 173.9 million tons of oil from the Middle East to China, and 52.4 million tons from Africa to China in 2016. Besides, China has established its first overseas military base in Djibouti which is considered by India as part of China’s “String of Pearls” strategy and would engulf India. If India is developing its military (three wings: army, navy, air force) to maximize its power, likewise it may avoid feeding its fears related to China’s port development assistance in the IOR as China is pursuing its own national economic and strategic interests. India perceives that these ports can disrupt the refuelling of India’s tankers, warships because of the presence of People’s Liberation Army Navy in the IOR. <span class='card-underline'>The contemporary world is </span><span class='card-underline'>globalised</span><span class='card-underline'> and interdependent where states </span><span class='card-underline'>have to</span><span class='card-underline'> cooperate with each other</span> in each walk of life. Therefore, India’s rhetoric regarding China’s development projects may prove unjustified in the future. Here the question arises that why is India one of the biggest trade partners of China if it feels that it would be engulfed by China? By the same token, India has presuppositions that the development of Gwadar Port in Pakistan’s Balochistan Province under China — Pakistan’s joint development project, China — Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) will pave the way for the formation of Chinese naval base in Gwadar. <span class='card-underline'>Fuelling</span><span class='card-underline'> fears against China, India has launched a nuclear capable Submarine in the Indian Ocean. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>This </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>nuclearisation</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> of Indian Ocean has serious security implications for Pakistan</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. </span>Thus, Pakistan needs a strategic partner currently (in the form of China) in order to monitor India’s naval activities in the Indian Ocean. China can monitor the naval activities of both the US and India on the Indian Ocean. <span class='card-underline'>The new generation of nuclear submarines may increase the risk of a devastating war between the two longstanding enemies</span> Some of the recent events such as India-China military standoff at Doklam from16 June 2017 — 28 August 2017 and India-Pakistan’s blame game on the unprovoked firing on the Line of Control region in 2017 and in the beginning of 2018that left hundreds of people dead and injured, are the destabilising incidents in the South Asian region. <span class='card-underline'>In </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the backdrop of these insecurities, Pakistan </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>has to</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>maximise</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> its </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>defence</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> Most recently, an embryonic formation of an alternative route against China’s B&R initiative by a quad of Australia, India, Japan and the US in order to contain China’s global influence may exacerbate some tensions at global level. India being part of this quad may pursue its strategic objective against China’s B & R initiative. India here has certain doubts about Chinese aims to deploy Gwadar in the medium to long term as a dual use port, allowing the PLA key access into the Indian Ocean as well as bolstering Pakistan’s ability to deter any Indian advantage in the naval realm. The Pakistani port of Gwadar, built, financed and operated by China is located at the union of the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea, providing China access to a key location in the Indian Ocean. In between all these states, Pakistan being an important part of China’s Belt and Road initiative can maximize it maritime security fittingly. Pakistan navy is likely to buy eight more diesel-electric attack submarines from China in near future. These are scheduled for delivery in 2028 to maximize Pakistan’s maritime security as a defensive measure. It may direct a response to India’s August 2016 deployment of its first nuclear submarine, the Arihant. A second, even more advanced Indian nuclear submarine, the Arighat, began sea trials last November, and four more boats are scheduled to join the fleet by 2025. That will give India a ‘nuclear triad,’ which means the country will have the ability to deliver a nuclear strike by land-based missiles, by warplanes, and by submarines. The submarine is the key component. It’s considered the most “survivable” in the event of a devastating first strike by an enemy, and thus able to deliver a retaliatory second strike. Lastly, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Both China and Pakistan will be able to monitor India’s naval activities in the Indian Ocean so that India’s attempt to get an advantage in the IO can be counterbalanced</span></span>. If, supposedly, that advantage will go unnoticed, there would be more chance of the nuclearisation When it comes to India and Pakistan, by contrast, the new generation of nuclear submarines may increase the risk of a devastating war between the two longstanding enemies. </p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'><span class='card-highlight'>The United States federal government should substantially increase reconstruction aid to Iraq and support UN efforts.</span>

Such <span class='card-underline'>a standard has resulted in an excessively restrictive “nexus” test, especially in the last ten years, requiring the presentation and “trying” of anthropological and cultural data</span>. The [*PG338]restrictive Canadian treatment, balanced against the liberal American treatment, potentially exposes interested individuals (members of native groups attempting to cross the U.S-Canadian border) to wild disparities in the law. Movement into the U.S. is highly deferential, and Indians enjoy great respect for prehistoric rights; however, movement into Canada essentially places the Indian individual on the same level as any other entering alien, despite his group’s occupation of the same borderlands for thousands of years preceding Great Britain’s establishment of the Canadian territories. In fact, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>despite the various legal conflicts and questions that have arisen around the language, Congress has done virtually nothing to restrict or narrow 8 U.S.C. sec. 1359, leaving courts to broadly interpret the statute</span></span><span class='card-underline'>;</span> similarly, some of the broadest interpretations of Section 289 can be found within the related federal regulations.203 Where some courts promptly dispense with the Jay Treaty (and the Treaty of Ghent) on the question of free passage of goods, other courts hedge the language in the Jay Treaty and subsequent law as merely stating a “natural law” sort of concept for free passage of individuals, a right enjoyed by Indians that preceded European arrival to the New World.

The rescue of Hungarian refugees after the abortive 1956 uprising or the Vietnamese refugees at various points of that conflict come readily to mind. While these were dramatic examples of international crises, the immigration situation in America today, though more mundane, is no less of a humanitarian emergency with human costs that are every bit as high and damage to the national interest no less long lasting.

When they limited the validity of a labor certification of 180 days, the US Department of Labor did so on their own without the fig leaf of legislative authorization.17 Remember when the AAO handed down the decision in New York State Department of Transportation,18 thus effectively repealing the national interest waiver statute for several years until the relaxation came?19 Finally, under the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1996, even if the Cuban national entered without inspection, the former INS Commissioner Doris Meissner clarified that the Service could use its authority under the humanitarian and significant public benefit criteria in Section 212(d)(5) to <span class='card-underline'>parole Cubans</span> who had entered without inspection under the fiction that the individual would surrender to the government, which in turn would release or parole him or her, and thus render them eligible for adjustment of status under the CAA.20 <span class='card-underline'>Did Congress tell them they could do that? </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>All of</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> these actions,</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and many others not singled out, had profound effect but </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>depended solely upon the imaginative exercise of executive authority</span></span><span class='card-underline'> yet consonant </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>with</span></span><span class='card-underline'> a proper </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>respect for separation of powers</span></span>.

Undemocratic, "Un-American" Value Judgment</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Restricting EB-3 immigration while favoring EB-1 immigration is not only a devaluation of the working-and middle-class immigrant populations, but it is also at odds with the fundamentals of U.S. law</span> - at least as it pertains to U.S. citizens. <span class='card-underline'>By packaging the visa groups this way</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>, </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Congress has relegated nonelite immigrants to a visa category fraught with obstacles</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> By contrast, an elite multinational executive or internationally acclaimed movie star is bestowed with a golden ticket as an EB-1. n104 It is difficult to imagine other areas of U.S. law that explicitly differentiate the treatment of persons on the basis of celebrity status, skill level, and education in any way comparable to the INA. n105</p><p>Historically, immigration laws have been uniquely situated vis-a-vis domestic constitutional and antidiscrimination protections. The federal government regulates immigration based on a number of enumerated and implied constitutional powers, n106 and Congress's authority to regulate immigrant admissions is subject to extremely minimal judicial intervention. n107 <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Antidiscrimination laws do not apply equally to U.S. citizens and aliens</span></span><span class='card-underline'>; instead, the government may invoke authority inherent in sovereignty to prevent certain groups from entering the country.</span> n108 <span class='card-underline'>This contrasts distinctly with domestic civil </span><span class='card-underline'>rights</span>  [*944]  <span class='card-underline'>regimes and the special protections of U.S. citizen minority groups within the country.</span> n109</p><p>U.S. immigration policy also has a tradition of excluding the poor and working classes, largely by means of laws providing for the inadmissibility and deportability of aliens likely to become public charges. n110 In other words, <span class='card-underline'>the reputation of the</span> <span class='card-underline'>U</span>nited <span class='card-underline'>S</span>tates <span class='card-underline'>as a haven for poor, underprivileged immigrants is a false, yet well-maintained, historical image</span>. n111 The increasing skill and education levels of legal immigrants contrasts with the unskilled, poor profile of undocumented immigrants to suggest that immigration policy is actually about controllingW U.S. demography rather than securing the nation's borders. n112 <span class='card-underline'>Because affluence and professional achievements facilitate immigration under current U.S. policy, "class biases are endemic to the modern immigration laws."</span> n113 At the time the 1990 INA amendments were made, policy was driven by a concern that "because most of the world was poor, we must limit immigration or risk being overrun." n114</p><p>Despite these constitutional and historical hurdles, in 1994, a group of aspiring EB-3 immigrants attempted to challenge the reallocation of EB visas under the 1990 INA, including the restrictive annual  [*945]  quota of 10,000 unskilled immigrants. n115 The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York found no violation of plaintiffs' Fifth Amendment substantive due process rights because of the rational relationship of the reallocations to Congress's "goal of reducing the waiting period for skilled workers." n116 The court's choice of language only reinforces the confusion amongst policy, public understanding, and law in this area: skilled workers, part of the EB-3 category, are disfavored by statute. Admittedly, they have a slight leg-up over unskilled workers (namely, evading the 10,000 per annum cap), but the functional effect of the INA in no way accelerates or facilitates their immigration. Rather, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Congress's goal in EB immigration policy was to ease provisions for those with extraordinary abilities, high-level professors and researchers, and multinational managers and executives - not skilled worker</span></span><span class='card-underline'>s</span>. n117</p><p>III. Proposal: Transforming EB Immigration from an Audition to an Application</p><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The current system of EB visa allocations contributes to brain drain, underserves U.S. economic interests, and prolongs a historical exemption of immigration law from antidiscrimination regimes</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> In light of this situation, <span class='card-underline'>a larger proportion of permanent immigrant visas should be allocated for skilled and unskilled workers, and the labor certification requirement should be waived for unskilled workers.</span> <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>This</span></span> Note <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>does not</span></span>, however, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>advocate a higher overall number of EB visas</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>.</span></p><p>A. Proposed Visa Allocations by Percentage</p><p>As a first step toward reform, it is appropriate to focus on the proportional allotment of visas instead of the overall number, because concerns regarding immigration generally stem from the "composition" of incoming immigrant groups rather than their quantity. n118 <span class='card-underline'>The</span><span class='card-underline'> allocation of EB visas should more closely resemble the natural spectrum of human abilities: only a small number (logically) comprises "that small percentage who have risen to the very top of [their] field of endeavor," in contrast to the 28.6% of visas that EB-1s now receive.</span> n119  [*946]  Thus, <span class='card-underline'>the bulk of EB visas should be reserved for skilled and unskilled labor, the group into which most immigrants likely fall.</span></p><p>Admittedly, any quantification of or numerical limitation on immigrant categories is, to some degree, arbitrary, but the following numbers provide an example of a more appropriate distribution. <span class='card-underline'>Amongst the 140,000 EB visas per annum currently available, EB-1 immigrants</span> - those with extraordinary abilities, high-level researchers and professors, and multinational executives and managers - <span class='card-underline'>should receive 5.2%</span>, or 7280, <span class='card-underline'>of the visas. EB-2s</span>, those with exceptional abilities and members of professions with advanced degrees, <span class='card-underline'>should receive 10.2%</span>, or 14,280, of the visas. <span class='card-underline'>Skilled workers, a subset of the current EB-3 category, should receive 35.2%</span>, or 49,280, of the visas; <span class='card-underline'>and unskilled workers</span>, another subset of the current EB-3 category, <span class='card-underline'>should receive 35.2%</span>, or 49,280, of the visas. <span class='card-underline'>n120 These percentages and numbers add up to the same proportion of worldwide immigrant visas currently allocated to EB-1, EB-2, and EB-3 categories</span>. Consequently, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the change would be limited to an internal rearrangement and would preserve the current taxonomy and nomenclature</span></span>. n121</p><p><span class='card-underline'>This redesigned allocation retains statutory privileges for the highly skilled and highly educated who seek to immigrate.</span> <span class='card-underline'>However, reducing the number of visas reserved for EB-1 and EB-2 immigrants would reduce brain drain</span>, n122 <span class='card-underline'>would better match the overall </span><span class='card-underline'>immigration</span>  [*947]  <span class='card-underline'>flow with the domestic economic needs</span> outlined above, and would create an EB-immigrant spectrum more closely resembling a natural bell curve than a combination of the Academy Awards and the Nobel Prize ceremonies. Furthermore, under these revised allocations, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the same total number of EB immigrants would be legally admitted as under the current regime; the only difference would be the internal makeup of the group</span></span>. In other words, there would be no net change to the number of arrivals per year.

The success of a majority of these startups heavily relies on STEM skillsets that include software/app development, data analytics and machine learning expertise, and the seamless integration of technologies that enhance user experiences. While the demand for STEM degrees continues to increase, the time needed to attain a higher education degree remains relatively constant and typically exceeds fifty-two months, well beyond the projected forty-eight months that students prefer. Several questions emerge from these findings: Is the rate of attaining a STEM degree or skillset keeping up with the evolving needs of society? Will advancements in automation and artificial intelligence reduce the demand for STEM workers? What policies should be considered to increase a nation’s competitiveness, in the age of artificial intelligence and automation?

However, the technological components needed to achieve this seemingly straightforward series of steps are enormous and include: the design of the chipsets used in the mobile device, the precision of the global positioning system (GPS) used to locate the user, the maintenance of the wireless network used to transmit data back and forth between the driver and the user, and most importantly, the seamless integration of these technologies that make all of this possible. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>As new companies are </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>created</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> and existing companies evolve, there will be an increased need for workers with skillsets that add value to these domains.

In 1983, the landmark report, A Nation at Risk, noted that “the ideal of academic excellence as the primary goal of schooling seems to be fading across the board in American education.”3 In 2005, nearly a quarter century after A Nation at Risk, the alarm once again was sounded over the looming challenge to U.S. pre-eminence in science and technology (S&T) in the National Academies’ seminal report, Rising Above the Gathering Storm. 4 This report posited that <span class='card-underline'>in the 21st century, educated, talented, motivated people and their ideas are paramount to creating the innovations that will sustain America’s prosperity</span>.5 Finally, in 2009, the Administration’s Strategy for American Innovation argued for investing in the building blocks of innovation, promoting competitive markets, and catalyzing breakthroughs for our Nation’s priorities.</p><p>A critical facet of America’s historical advantage in S&T innovation has been the ability to attract, develop, and retain talented individuals from abroad. Indeed, over the past few decades, many STEM fields in the United States have become increasingly dependent on foreign-born talent. However, <span class='card-underline'>global competition for STEM talent is growing</span> <span class='card-underline'>as many countries increase their R&D capacity and improve their own STEM education systems</span>.

American advances in nuclear weapons technology in the 1950s made possible the ‘first offset strategy’ nullifying the Soviet superiority in conventional numbers, and when Moscow narrowed the gap, heavy ‘second offset’ investment in emerging stealth and smart weapons technologies ensured the US lead remained through the 80s and 90s. But what of the decades since? US Secretary of Defense James Mattis, warned in his speech at John Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies on 19th January, “<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>our competitive edge has eroded in every domain of warfare, air, land, sea, space and cyberspace, </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>and it is continuing to erode</span></span>.” <span class='card-underline'>There is a growing consensus that the once-unassailable US technological advantage is fast </span><span class='card-underline'>fading, and</span><span class='card-underline'> might even soon be ceded to one of its rivals, probably China</span>, in the course of renewed competition between ‘Great Powers’, the like of which the world has not seen for over half a century. On the face of it, it is hard to see why. The US has certainly not become any less innovative or technologically capable than either Russia or China; current Defense News data shows that the United States is home to no fewer than 15 of the world’s top 25 defence contractors, and according to Forbes, exactly the same holds true for technology companies too. The talent is evidently there – but this is a game as much about focus as capability, and US attention has been distracted. An era of distraction: the demands of asymmetric warfare In fairness, the Twin Towers was hardly an event to be simply ignored, but in launching its ‘War on Terror’, Washington suddenly and dramatically shifted focus onto a very different kind of adversary and the new and immediate demands of asymmetric warfare and counter-insurgency. “In launching its ‘War on Terror’, Washington shifted focus onto a very different kind of adversary.” At the same time ‘second offset’ technologies were proliferating around the world, resources that would otherwise have been allocated towards developing and cementing ‘third offset’ weapons, and capabilities to maintain military dominance, were instead expended in Iraq and Afghanistan. While the US focused on dismantling the terrorists’ networks, training camps and safe-havens, China steadily ramped up its defence investment and innovation, developing its own systems and technologies to equip its military for the 21stCentury, and potentially challenge American hegemony in the Pacific. <span class='card-underline'>The irony is that, in many ways, the success of what Eisenhower dubbed the ‘military-industrial complex’</span>, a success that first helped the US to global pre-eminence in the first place, <span class='card-underline'>has also brought about its current predicament. Could the model that seemed so right for so long, now be quite wrong?</span> Consolidated dream teams and suffering competition “<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>We cannot expect success fighting tomorrow’s conflicts with yesterday’s weapons or equipment</span></span>,” Mattis told his audience at John Hopkins, and yet in essence that is often what the Department of Defense (DOD) does when it comes to technological innovation. The DOD development blueprint was well-honed for the era in which it was devised, but it is now increasingly beginning to look as if it has become outmoded. Big defence spending throughout the Cold War, followed by the huge consolidation of the US defence sector when both came to an end has left a legacy approach based on rigid requirements, and contracts aimed at the same small number of specialist contractors. In addition, the costs of the programmes are often so high that ‘dream teams’ of prime defence contractors, who should in theory be rivals, band together to bid for Pentagon projects. There are two big consequences. Firstly, <span class='card-underline'>having spent so much on their development and procurement, the resulting systems are almost invariably forced to remain in service for many years</span>, albeit modified and upgraded, irrespective of changing needs and technological advances. Secondly, and ultimately more importantly, competition inevitably suffers, and without the need to compete, there is little incentive to take a risk and innovate. As Eisenhower put it in the same 1961 farewell speech that first introduced the term ‘military-industrial complex’ to the common lexicon, “a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity.” The economic paradox of the innovation deficit Economic factors play a major role too. While the US has the world’s largest defence expenditure in dollar terms, paradoxically many point to a lack of DOD spending as one of the key reasons for the nation’s growing innovation deficit. An important budgetary trend lies hidden in the high absolute numbers. <span class='card-underline'>Since 2009, the US </span><span class='card-underline'>defence</span><span class='card-underline'> spend has fallen from 4.6% of GDP to just 3.3% today</span>, and although the latest figures from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute show that this decline has now been reversed, the fact remains that <span class='card-underline'>GDP expenditure on R&D is </span><span class='card-underline'>less than half what it was thirty years ago.</span> “Since 2009, the US defence spend has fallen from 4.6% of GDP to just 3.3% today.” For small-to-medium companies in the mid- and lower-tiers of the sector, that generates something of a crisis of commercial confidence when it comes to investing heavily in developing precisely the kinds of technologies that the Pentagon needs for the future. <span class='card-underline'>The same is certainly not true in China, where innovation in the industry is booming</span>, creating the ideal conditions to incubate a talent pool for the future that is as competitive as it is inventive. It is hard to imagine that the two things are not related. However, it would be far too simplistic to suggest that it is simply all about government investment. If technology is to remain at the heart of the oft-quoted US ‘overmatch’, the DOD also needs to address changing marketplace realities and accept that with the huge expansion of global tech firms, defence contracts are now significantly less influential than they once were. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Putting it bluntly, </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the Pentagon no longer has the deepest pockets in town</span></span>. In the 2015 study ‘National Security Technology Accelerator: A Plan for Civil-Military Industry Innovation’ from New York University, the authors observed that “<span class='card-underline'>the emergence of international commercial and consumer high-tech markets over the past two decades has substantially displaced DOD as the </span><span class='card-underline'>centre</span><span class='card-underline'> of gravity for global R&D activity</span>.” It is for these markets that many of the cutting-edge technologies that the US military may one day come to depend on are being developed, not the traditional defence contract route. Reshaping relationships: Forging new commercial partnerships That does not automatically make for a tale of doom and gloom. The DOD has a long history of working successfully with the private sector, and some of today’s most profoundly important technologies, including the internet and GPS navigation, arose directly as a result, while many others have been significantly boosted by defence funded projects. Nevertheless, as Adam Jay Harrison, the National Security Technology Accelerator director, has pointed out, too many technology businesses – even some that have previously enjoyed DOD support – are now “turning their backs” on the Pentagon. The challenge is to re-forge and reshape the relationship between commercial technology companies and the military to make it fit for this century, not the last. “One path to more fully align civilian technology opportunities with the Defense enterprise is for DOD to radically rethink its approach to acquisition and industry engagement in a manner that is more consistent with commercial market norms,” the New York University study concludes. If it does not, then the risk of the US losing its long-standing innovative edge becomes very real indeed – and China is waiting.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'><span class='card-highlight'>The CP’s economic and military expansion is the only way to solve the advantage</span></div><div class='cite'><span class='card-highlight'>Burns, 14</span></div><div class='card-body'><p>(Nicholas Burns, Professor of the Practice of Diplomacy and International Politics at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government and former U.S. Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs What Washington Can Do to Revive Relations With New Delhi, Foreign Affairs, 00157120, Sep/Oct2014, Vol. 93, Issue 5)</p><p>In the century ahead, U.S. strategic interests will align more closely with India's than they will with those of any other continental power in Asia. The United States and India both seek to spread democracy, expand trade and investment, counter terrorism, and, above all, keep the region peaceful by balancing China's growing military power<span class='card-underline'>. As Washington expands its presence in Asia</span> as part of the so-called pivot, <span class='card-underline'>New Delhi will be a critical partner</span>. In the Asia-Pacific region, especially, India joins Australia, Japan, South Korea, and others in a U.S.-led coalition of democratic allies. And as the most powerful state in South Asia, India will exert a positive influence on a troubled Afghanistan, as well as on Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. The <span class='card-underline'>Obama</span> administration <span class='card-underline'>should</span> therefore use its remaining two years to <span class='card-underline'>make India a greater priority,</span> especially since the country has not yet figured prominently in the rebalancing of U.S. attention and resources to Asia.

With the election of a new government in New Delhi, the <span class='card-underline'>Obama</span> administration <span class='card-underline'>has a chance to repair the relationship.</span> In May, <span class='card-underline'>Indians voted into office</span> Narendra <span class='card-underline'>Modi</span>, a Hindu nationalist from the western state of Gujarat <span class='card-underline'>who has signaled</span> that <span class='card-underline'>he wants to build a more ambitious partnership</span> with the United States. <span class='card-underline'>That will happen </span><span class='card-underline'>only if</span><span class='card-underline'> Obama pushes India to the top of his foreign policy agenda</span> and Modi implements a series of reforms to enable stronger economic and political ties between the two governments. The leaders are scheduled to hold their first meeting in Washington this September, and before they do, <span class='card-underline'>both should begin thinking about rebuilding the</span> U.S.-Indian <span class='card-underline'>relationship in five key ways:</span> <span class='card-underline'>by expanding bilateral trade</span>, <span class='card-underline'>strengthening military cooperation</span>, collaborating to combat threats to homeland security, stabilizing a post-American Afghanistan, <span class='card-underline'>and</span>, especially, <span class='card-underline'>finding greater common ground on transnational challenges </span>such as climate change. It is an ambitious agenda, but <span class='card-underline'>pursuing it would put India where it belongs: at the center of U.S. strategy in the region</span>. FALLING OUT Many Indian officials look back on the presidency of George W. Bush as a special moment in U.S.-Indian relations. From his first days in office, Bush made India a priority, arguing that its flourishing market economy, entrepreneurial drive, democratic system, and growing young population were crucial to U.S. aims in the region. He saw that the two countries, far from being strategic rivals, shared many of the same views on how power should be balanced in the twenty-first century. He believed that the United States had a clear interest in supporting India's rise as a global power. The results of his emphasis were dramatic. <span class='card-underline'>The volume of trade in goods and services between the United States and India has more than tripled since 2004.</span> Also since then, the two governments have dramatically strengthened their military ties and launched new cooperative projects on space, science and technology, education, and democratic governance. Bush also engineered one of the most important initiatives in the history of the U.S.-Indian relationship: the civil nuclear agreement, which for the first time permitted U.S. firms to invest in India's civil nuclear power sector. (I served as the lead American negotiator for the deal.) This agreement helped end India's nuclear isolation, allowing New Delhi to trade in civil nuclear technology even though it is not a party to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. In return, India opened up its civil nuclear industry for the first time to sustained international inspection. The agreement's real import, though, lay in its message to the Indian people: the United States took their country seriously and wanted to leave behind the previous decades of cool relations. More broadly, it was a signal of U.S. support for India's emerging global role. When Obama took office, he followed Bush's lead. After all, Bush's India policy had enjoyed rare and strong support from Democrats -- including then U.S. Senators Joseph Biden, Hillary Clinton, and Obama himself -- throughout his second term. In 2009, Obama hosted then Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his wife as the administration's first official state visitors. During his own successful state visit to New Delhi in 2010, Obama became the first U.S. president to endorse India's bid to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council. Yet despite this promising start, <span class='card-underline'>Obama's India policy never hit full stride</span>. Although Clinton, as secretary of state, collaborated with New Delhi on development and women's issues, the administration was understandably preoccupied with the more urgent short-term crises it had inherited on taking office: the global financial meltdown, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the threat of a nuclear Iran. It was a classic Washington story of near-term crises crowding out long-term ambitions. As Obama's first term ended, India slid down Washington's priority list, and Indian officials complained privately about what they saw as a lack of attention from their American counterparts. To be fair to Obama, however, <span class='card-underline'>the Indian government played an even greater role in the relationship's decline. </span>In 2010, the Indian Parliament passed an ill-advised nuclear liability law that placed excessive responsibility on suppliers for accidents at nuclear power plants. The legislation, which gained support after the 25th anniversary of a horrific chemical spill at an American-owned plant in Bhopal, shattered investor confidence. By deterring U.S. and other firms from entering the Indian market, the law made implementation of the civil nuclear agreement impossible, undermining what should have been the centerpiece of the two countries' relationship. Washington and New Delhi haven't managed to resolve the impasse. The relationship suffered further when Indian economic growth slowed markedly in 2012 and 2013, depressing foreign investment, as the government, led by the Indian National Congress, was rocked by corruption allegations and failed to implement promised reforms in retail, insurance, energy, and infrastructure. New Delhi unwisely imposed discriminatory taxes on foreign investors and enacted protectionist measures that impeded trade. A series of bitterly fought U.S.-Indian trade disputes took center stage, overshadowing the political and military ties that had been the glue of the growing partnership and preventing the two countries from being able to strike any major new economic agreements. Then came two severe diplomatic tempests. Over the course of 2013, as Modi emerged as a front-runner in the upcoming election, the Indian press revived the story of Washington's earlier decision to bar Modi from entering the United States on the grounds that he had failed to suppress deadly anti-Muslim riots in 2002, when he was chief minister of Gujarat. Bush administration officials, including me, believed this to be the right decision at the time, but many Modi supporters charged that the visa ban was yet another example of American disregard for Indian dignity. Then, in December 2013, U.S. federal agents arrested Devyani Khobragade, India's deputy consul general in New York, for lying on her housekeeper's visa application, infuriating the Indian press and public. It was a perfect but avoidable storm. The United States should have handled the visa issue at the core of the dispute in private to avoid inflaming India's bruised ego, and the Indian government, which made matters worse by downgrading security at the U.S. embassy in New Delhi and refusing to renew teachers' visas at the American Embassy School, should have reacted more calmly. Instead, both governments fanned the flames, and anti-American furor dominated the news in India for weeks. <span class='card-underline'>By early 2014, the collapse in confidence was all too visible, and this is what Obama and Modi must begin working to repair when they meet</span>. At the same time, U.S. Secretary of State John <span class='card-underline'>Kerry</span>, Secretary of Defense Chuck <span class='card-underline'>Hagel, and</span> Secretary of the Treasury Jack <span class='card-underline'>Lew must act</span>, in effect, <span class='card-underline'>as project managers, steering the relationship past the inevitable obstacles</span>, just as then Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice did so capably in Bush's second term. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Top-down government leadership is essential to motivate the vast U.S. bureaucracy to put India back at the center of Washington's attentio</span></span><span class='card-underline'>n</span>. <span class='card-underline'>Obama</span>, meanwhile, <span class='card-underline'>will find a willing partner in Modi</span>. Remarkably, the prime minister has exhibited no public signs of resentment over the visa issue and, in a show of good faith, decided in May that he would visit Washington instead of insisting that Obama first visit New Delhi.

The principle driving force of the media campaign is the traditional China-India rivalry, and its collective pitch is that OBOR is aimed at promoting an imperial Chinese dominance in East Asia, South Asia, and elsewhere. Of course, East Asia is China’s old stomping ground and, as a rising power, it is natural that Beijing would expand its sphere of influence. A more rational response for India in East Asia is to try and outbid China diplomatically and economically by creating small alliances of its own and by offering economic assistance through its own longstanding Look East strategy. Look East, however, has a problem: While it has long looked good on paper, the strategy has never been followed consistently or vigorously by successive Indian prime ministers. Pursuing mega-strategies has never been India’s wont, and in any case the country until recently has lacked the deep funds needed to throw money at Southeast Asian countries who have been sympathetic to India’s aspirations and who would have been happy recipients of its economic assistance. Under Modi things changed. He brought to office a strong desire to couch China-India ties as essentially competitive. But India’s political culture is not so quick to absorb changes of that magnitude. Indian bureaucracies are full of personnel who are deeply mired in the Nehruvian notion of vacuous moralism, which was deeply committed to non-alignment and never paid much attention to the Great Power politics of the 1950s and 1960s. This created a lot of hoopla during the Cold War years, but that hoopla no longer finds an audience, even within Third World countries in the 21st century. <span class='card-underline'>While emphasizing the competitive nature of Indo-Chinese strategic ties, Modi also has made sure that his country continues to take advantage of China’s own interests in cultivating its economic ties with India</span>. This is a nuanced policy from the side of both Beijing and New Delhi. <span class='card-underline'>As much as Sino-Indian strategic competition remained hot for the past several decades, neither New Delhi nor Beijing wanted to jeopardize their bilateral economic trade.</span> Consequently, bilateral trade "surged from under $3 billion in 2000 to nearly $52 billion in 2008)…. Even conservative estimates suggest that, by 2020, China-India trade could surpass last year’s US-China total of $409.2 billion and more than half of total projected US-China trade in 2020." As China continues to travel toward its goal of becoming the second superpower, it sees India as a challenger that should not be ignored for at least two reasons. First, India has managed to develop close strategic ties with the United States through the purchase of military weapons, the planning of joint military exercises, and the transfer of technology. India also aspires to become a member of the Nuclear Supply Group, after which it would likely become a serious competitor of China in the area of nuclear weapons development. That is one reason why China continues to veto India’s entry into that group, even while it leaves all doors of mutual economic cooperation wide open. China’s greatest success in gaining the upper hand over India is in its multifaceted strategic ties with Pakistan. <span class='card-underline'>The emergence of a nuclear Pakistan</span>, in which China’s transfer of nuclear knowledge and blueprints of actual nuclear weapons designs played a major role, <span class='card-underline'>tied down India’s own nuclear preparedness on two different fronts: China and Pakistan. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>What bothers India the most is the fact that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor has not only given Pakistan the promise of emergence as a major economic actor</span></span>, but that the corridor passes through the disputed territory of Kashmir on the Pakistan border. It is reported that China tried to appease India by offering to change the name of the corridor through Pakistan; however, it dropped that suggestion after Pakistan protested. India’s major objection to the inclusion of the disputed territory was one explicit reason why it decided to boycott the OBOR summit. India’s neighbors are sold on President Xi’s sales pitch for OBOR, which he called the “project of the century,” and these states are poised to join it. Since poverty is the dominant issue throughout South Asia, <span class='card-underline'>China’s promise that this program will tackle poverty makes a lot of sense to India’s neighbors. India says that promise is mere hype. But as Western-oriented globalization continues to hurt their economies through high unemployment and rising inflation, most poverty-stricken countries of the Third World have started to envision OBOR as a source of economic assistance and financial relief</span>. Another Indian criticism depicts OBOR as imperialistic in nature. As one of the main leaders of the non-aligned movement of the Cold War years, India still presumes itself to be a rightful actor to question China’s motives regarding its role as the rising economic power of the 21st Century. However, as another rising economic power of Asia, and an actor that emulates China’s policies of seeking alliances and offering economic assistance to several countries, India is open to like criticism from Beijing. And China never fails to remind the world that, as a former victim of imperialistic policies and occupation by the West and Japan, it has remained firmly opposed to such policies. The global hubs of economic activities -- places such as New York, London, and Berlin -- are likely to have new additions including Beijing and Shanghai. India, meanwhile, has not been able to find an equally promising way to counter OBOR. So, it is left with flimsy excuses (flimsy in the sense that they find no global supportive audience) like criticizing that strategy because it involves the disputed territory of Kashmir that is under Pakistani administration. In all likelihood, through OBOR, the Chinese view of the hierarchy of nations and the pecking order of nation-states is likely to change. <span class='card-underline'>Despite </span><span class='card-underline'>all of</span><span class='card-underline'> the criticisms of its potential complications and its chances for failure, and </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>India’s related suspicion of China’s ulterior motives, OBOR carries with it the </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>enormous economic power</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> of China and an </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>equally powerful resolve by its leadership</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> to make it a success</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> Even the United States and Japan realize that and are likely to remain involved in it without joining it, for now.

Is there another way?</span> The authors think there is. <span class='card-underline'>While INA Section 245 conditions adjustment of status on having a current priority date and meeting various conditions</span>,9 <span class='card-underline'>there would be prohibition anywhere that would bar USCIS from allowing the beneficiary of an approved I-140 or I-130 petition to apply for an employment authorization</span> document (EAD) and advance parole. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>No action by Congress would be required; executive fiat suffices</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> For those who want some comfort in finding a statutory basis, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the government could rely on its parole authority under INA</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Section 212</span></span>(d)(5) <span class='card-underline'>to</span> <span class='card-underline'>grant</span> such <span class='card-underline'>interim benefits</span> either <span class='card-underline'>for "urgent humanitarian</span> <span class='card-underline'>reasons" or "significant public benefit</span>.10 <span class='card-underline'>There is nothing in 8 CFR Section 212.5 that would prohibit the DHS from granting parole</span> for this reason on the grounds that the continued presence of I-140 or I-130 beneficiaries provide a significant public benefit. <span class='card-underline'>Since such parole is not a legal admission,11 there is no separation of powers argument since the Executive is not trying to change existing grounds of admission</span> <span class='card-underline'>or</span> <span class='card-underline'>create</span> any <span class='card-underline'>new ones</span>. Moreover, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Congress appears to have provided the government with broad authority to provide work authorization to</span></span> just about <span class='card-underline'>any non-citizen</span>.12 It is undeniably true that more EAD and Parole benefits will be of limited value to retrogressed non-citizens from India and China who are already in the US in the employment-based second and third preferences. After all, most have an H-1B and can extend under Section 106(a) or Section 104(c) of AC 21, but as noted previously, some may still not be able to take advantage of AC 21. The EAD in itself will not have a portability benefit. The foreign national will still need to intend to work for the sponsoring employer even if he/she is using the EAD for open market employment. This reservation, valid as it undoubtedly is, focuses only on those already here. It speaks solely to past migration flows not to future ones. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>For future flows, this will supplement the H-1B by giving employers of foreign nationals another option. No longer will the constant controversy over the H-1B quota discredit all employment-based immigratio</span></span><span class='card-underline'>n </span>in the eyes of its critics and, most importantly, in the court of public opinion. <span class='card-underline'>No longer will this one dispute suck all the oxygen out of our national immigration debate</span>. Beyond that, <span class='card-underline'>it is </span>manifestly <span class='card-underline'>not true to argue that</span> <span class='card-underline'>all </span>of our <span class='card-underline'>immigration needs </span>can <span class='card-underline'>be solved with more H1B numbers. </span>This will not work for those who are not H1B material. It will not work for those with essential skills but find themselves in the "Other Worker" backlog under INA Section 203(b)(3)(iii) with no hope of getting the green card any time soon. It will not eliminate the need to legalize the undocumented. If anything, <span class='card-underline'>allowing non-citizens with approved </span>I-140/ I-130 <span class='card-underline'>petitions to receive EADs and Parole will </span>serve to <span class='card-underline'>reduce the size of the permanently undocumented in America </span>many of whom do not leave for fear they will be unable to return. The Executive would not be granting the undocumented legal status for that is what only Congress can do. But, like adjustment of status itself, <span class='card-underline'>the Executive certainly can create a period of stay that permits the undocumented to remain here. While those out of status or who entered without inspection should not receive employment authorization on a retroactive basis, there is no reason in law or logic why the Executive cannot grant parole on a </span><span class='card-underline'>nunc</span><span class='card-underline'> pro </span><span class='card-underline'>tunc</span><span class='card-underline'> basis.</span>13 Leaving aside the troubling question of whether such a policy change would not reward conduct that violates the law, the retroactive EAD would only cure the unauthorized employment problem but not the overstay or unlawful presence problem. The 3/10 year bar14 is not triggered by a violation of status resulting from unauthorized employment but an overstay past the I-94 validity. For this reason, a retroactive EAD would do nothing to ameliorate the crushing harshness of the 3/10 year bar, though it might restore eligibility in some situations to adjust by avoiding the unauthorized employment preclusion of INA 245(c).15 What would cure the prior unlawful presence would be a retroactive granting of parole. Look at the definition of "unlawful presence" in INA 212 (a)(9)(B)(ii). It speaks of being "present in the United States after the expiration of the period of stay authorized by the Attorney General or is present in the United States without being admitted or paroled." So, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>if you are present in the USA on parole, you are not accumulating any unlawful presence.</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>You can grant retroactive parole without overriding the will of Congress.

While such logic is compelling, why not <span class='card-underline'>expand its application to other instances where aliens have served and strengthened the national interest or performed work in the national interest</span>? How about <span class='card-underline'>granting PIP to families of, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>outstanding researchers striving to unlock the mysteries of science and technology, those with exceptional or extraordinary ability, and key employees of US companies doing important jobs for which qualified Americans cannot be found</span></span>? And there is also a compelling interest in ensuring family unification so that US citizens or <span class='card-underline'>permanent residents may feel less stressed and can go on to have productive lives that will in turn help the nation</span>. All such people do us proud by making our cause their own and the need of their loved ones to come in from the shadows is real and present. Indeed, the non-military use of PIP was advocated by top USCIS officials several years ago in a memo to USCIS Director Mayorkas, a memo leaked by its critics who wished successfully to kill it. In the face of inaction on the part of the GOP controlled House to enact immigration reform, granting PIP to all immediate relatives of US citizens would allow them to adjust in the US rather than travel abroad and risk the 3 and 10 year bars of inadmissibility. Such <span class='card-underline'>administrative relief would be far less controversial than granting deferred action since immediate relatives of US citizens are anyway eligible for permanent residence</span>. The only difference is that they could apply for their green cards in the US without needing to travel overseas and apply for waivers of the 3 and 10 year bars. The concept of PIP can be extended to other categories, such as beneficiaries of preference petitions, which the authors have explained in The Tyranny of Priority Dates. However, they need to have demonstrated lawful status as a condition for being able to adjust status under INA section 245(c)(2) and <span class='card-underline'>the memo currently states that “[p]</span><span class='card-underline'>arole</span><span class='card-underline'> does not erase any periods of unlawful status.” There is no reason why this policy cannot be reversed. The grant of PIP, especially to someone who arrived in the past without admission or parole, can retroactively give that person lawful status too</span>, thus rendering him or her eligible to adjust status through the I-130 petition as a preference beneficiary. The only place in INA section 245 where the applicant is required to have maintained lawful nonimmigrant status is under INA section 245(c)(7), which is limited to employment-based immigrants. Family-based immigrants are not so subject. What about INA section 245(c)(2)’s insistence on “lawful immigration status” at the snapshot moment of I-485 submission? Even this would not be a problem. For purposes of section 245(c) of the Act, current <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>regulations already define “lawful immigration status” to include “parole status which has not expired, been revoked, or terminated</span></span>.” 8 C.F.R. section 245.1(d)(v).</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>History is on our side – the executive legitimately granted parole in Cuba, Haiti, Vietnam, Hungary, and more. </div><div class='cite'>Columbia Law School Human Rights Clinic 10 (“MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF A UNITED STATES POLICY GENEROUSLY GRANTING HUMANITARIAN PAROLE FOR HAITIAN VICTIMS OF THE EARTHQUAKE OF JANUARY 12, 2010” February 25, http://www.law.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/legacy/files/humanitarian_parole_memo_to_uscis_final.pdf)</div><div class='card-body'><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The Executive’s discretion regarding parole status has been interpreted by courts to be very broad and entitled to a strong presumption of legitimacy</span></span>.15 However, the statutes and regulations governing the factors relevant to the parole determination do not authorize the consideration of race or national origin by those officials making the determination.16 <span class='card-underline'>There is a strong tradition of Executive reliance upon this discretionary power to extend parole to victims of tragedy and repression at various points throughout the nation’s history.</span> In 1956, <span class='card-underline'>the Eisenhower administration invoked the parole power to temporarily admit 15,000 Hungarians fleeing communist persecution.</span>17 <span class='card-underline'>The power was instrumental in the United States’ response to the Cuban refugee crisis of the 1960s and permitted the President to respond appropriately to refugee influxes from Vietnam, Haiti and Cuba in the 1970s.</span> The Refugee Act of 1980 altered the parole authority by establishing the requirement that parole status be given to refugees only if there are “compelling reasons in the public inter requiring that the determination be made “with respect to that particular alien.”18 <span class='card-underline'>Nonetheless, the government relied on the parole authority to respond effectively to the arrival of more than 150,000 Cubans during the Mariel boatlifts and a large influx of individuals fleeing Haiti in 1980</span>. While the new restrictions established by the Refugee Act of 1980 were to take effect sixty days following the Act’s enactment on March 17, 1980, they were sufficiently flexible as to allow the President to extend parole status to those migrants who arrived before October 10 of that year.19 <span class='card-underline'>For 30 years prior to 1981, the United States had a policy of general parole for undocumented aliens arriving in the United States seeking admission</span>.20 It was not until that year that the policy was changed to require detention without parole of any aliens arriving in the United States who could not present a prima facie case for admission.21 Since that time, <span class='card-underline'>the</span> United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (<span class='card-underline'>USCIS</span>) <span class='card-underline'>has interpreted the parole authority as being sufficiently flexible to grant the USCIS authority to establish the new</span> Cuban Family Reunification Parole Program (<span class='card-underline'>CFRP</span>).22 Under the U.S.-Cuba Migration Accords, the United States seeks to provide 20,000 travel documents annually to Cubans seeking to emigrate.23 However, statutory restrictions on the number of family-based immigrant visas and constraints placed on the Cuban Lottery Program by the Cuban government have severely hampered such efforts.24 As a result, <span class='card-underline'>USCIS has relied upon the executive parole authority to establish the CFRP as a means of achieving its annual goal of 20,000 legal migrants from Cubans to the United States</span>.25 The USCIS thus has the legal authority to establish a parole program for Haitian victims of the January 12 earthquake. <span class='card-underline'>The </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>U.S. government has granted parole status to victims of tragedies and persecution since the 1950s and continues to use such power to grant temporary status to migrants from other countries in the region, such as Cuba.

Brand X can be used as a force for good. For instance, in Sciallaba v.

Matter of Wang held that not all children who are unable to protect their age under the Child Status Protection Act can claim the earlier priority date under which their parent immigration to the United States. As the plurality opinion in Sciallaba v.

In our prior article relating to not counting relatives, Why We Can’t Wait: How President Obama Can Erase Immigrant Visa Backlogs With A Stroke Of A Pen, http://www.ilw.com/articles/2012,0201-endelman.shtm, we discussed that there are admittedly some statutory provisions which might be read as pointing against an interpretation to not count family members. Most notably, it has also been pointed to us that INA section 202(b) permits a spouse or child to “cross charge” to the foreign state of either of the parents or the spouse to avoid family separation, and this may suggest that derivatives must be individually counted for purposes of the per country cap. Still, this too can be interpreted differently under Chevronand Brand X, namely, that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the entire family be counted as single unit to the other spouse or parent’s country</span></span>. Of course, the statutory provision which militates in favor of such an interpretation is most notably the text of INA §203(d) itself.

In addition, the INA establishes various mechanisms for enforcing these rules, including by prescribing the removal of aliens found to have entered the United States without permission, or to have violated the terms governing their authorized admission into the country.8 It also established criminal penalties for certain immigration violations. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>On the other hand, </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the INA expressly or impliedly confers some discretionary authority on the executive branch in matters of immigration enforcemen</span></span><span class='card-underline'>t</span>. For example, the <span class='card-underline'>INA authorizes immigration officials to grant certain types of benefits or relief to qualifying aliens who </span><span class='card-underline'>lack lawful immigration status</span>. Moreover, the <span class='card-underline'>INA permits immigration officials to waive certain statutory restrictions that might otherwise render an alien ineligible to receive </span><span class='card-underline'>particular immigration</span><span class='card-underline'> benefits</span>. The exercise of <span class='card-underline'>these discretionary authorities may enable some unlawfully present aliens to remain in the United States—through asylum</span>, <span class='card-underline'>temporary protected status</span>, <span class='card-underline'>cancellation of removal, or some other means—rather than being removed</span>. In other cases, however, <span class='card-underline'>aliens</span> who have entered or have stayed in the United States <span class='card-underline'>in violation of INA requirements may be permitted to remain in the country and, in some cases, legalize their status</span>, not as the result of the exercise of expressly delegated authority, but <span class='card-underline'>as </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>a result of </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the executive branch’s independent discretion in enforcing the law</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> Article II of the Constitution specifically tasks the Executive to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,” and the executive branch has historically been seen as having some discretion (commonly known as prosecutorial or enforcement discretion) in determining when, against whom, how, and even whether to prosecute apparent violations of the law. For example, immigration officials may opt to give a lower priority to the removal of certain categories of unlawfully present aliens because the removal of other categories (e.g., those convicted of serious crimes) has been deemed a higher priority in light of resource constraints and other considerations.16 Congressional enactments could, however, be seen as limiting the executive’s discretion not to take particular actions (e.g., by mandating that certain aliens be detained pending removal proceedings).17 The express adoption of an executive policy that is “in effect an abdication of ... statutory duty” could also be found to be impermissible,18 but <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>it might be difficult for a court to assess the degree of nonenforcement that would entail an “abdication</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>.”</span></span><span class='card-underline'> The executive branch’s discretion to interpret applicable statutes </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>when Congress has not spoken to the precise question at issue may also afford immigration officials some flexibility in determining how INA requirements apply to a particular alien or category of alien</span></span><span class='card-underline'>s</span>.19 This discretion may be relevant in determining how particular statutory grants of discretionary authority are to be applied (e.g., what constitutes “exceptional and extremely unusual hardship” for purposes of cancellation of removal, or “extreme hardship” for purposes of certain waivers of inadmissibility).20 It can also play a role in determining whether and how particular statutes are seen to circumscribe the Executive’s enforcement discretion. That is,<span class='card-underline'> where a statute is silent or ambiguous as to the circumstances of its enforcement </span><span class='card-underline'>in particular cases</span><span class='card-underline'>, the Executive may have some discretion in determining its application.</span></p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>The perm is severance – The CP doesn’t include Congress and doesn’t remove a restriction, it just stops enforcing it.

Over the past few weeks, I've been struck in reading the many news stories about the brewing confrontation by the fact that none of the stories addresses what seems to me the central question at the heart of the developing standoff between the President and Congress: How much discretion does Obama have under the Immigration and Naturalization Act to decline, as a matter of policy, to deport millions of people? <span class='card-underline'>Republicans are tossing around all sorts of rhetoric about Obama's decision to proceed unilaterally. John Boehner has floated the idea of litigating the matter</span>. Some Republicans have described such an "amnesty" as a constitutional crisis. <span class='card-underline'>Some have even talked about impeachment</span>. All of that assumes, of course, that the coming action is illegal, that the statute itself doesn't give Obama authority to decide to stay his hand with respect to lots of deportations. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Yet I have seen </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>no news story or legal analysis that contains an actual argument to that effect</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. </span>We do not yet know exactly what President Obama intends to do, so we cannot hold the details of his coming executive action up against the statute. But if we are to believe news reports, he plans to create some kind of program under which undocumented aliens who meet certain criteria---family members in the United States, no criminal record, etc.---can come forward and receive what amounts to a quasi-legal status under which authorities will not pursue removal actions against them. Obama himself has sown doubt about this own authority to effectuate this policy outcome without congressional involvement---stating in the past that he would love to do it, but did not think he had the legal authority. But at least as I read <span class='card-underline'>the relevant provisions of the Immigration and Naturalization Act, the statute </span><span class='card-underline'>actually gives</span><span class='card-underline'> him wide discretion to decline to deport non-criminal aliens who are legally deportable. S</span>pecifically, it contains no directive requiring the administration to pursue garden variety deportation cases. In fact, it has very little to say at all---except with respect to aliens who have committed crimes---about what happens if the President just doesn't feel like deporting people. That silence seems to me to convey the authority not to act, both in the case of an individual whose circumstances authorities find compelling and also in the case of five million people whose circumstances authorities find compelling or whose status authorities choose for policy reasons to regularize. Let's go through the statute. The key legal requirement appears in 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a): "<span class='card-underline'>Any alien . . . in and admitted to the United States shall, upon the order of the Attorney General, be removed if the alien is within one or more of the following classes of deportable aliens." What follows is a long list of legal bases for deportation, but for present purposes, what matters is the language of this general command. It appears</span><span class='card-underline'>, on first glance, to</span><span class='card-underline'> be mandatory. The alien, after all, shall be removed. But look again. The mandatory language only applies "upon the order of the Attorney General."</span> And the statute makes no demand that the attorney general issue such an order merely because an alien falls into one of the categories of deportability. <span class='card-underline'>The statute, in other words, requires that an alien be removed if he is within a deportable class and if the attorney general orders him removed. As a practical matter, the attorney general does not decide these things himself. There's a whole immigration adjudication system to decide these cases for him (subject to his ultimate review). And the statute lays out a whole framework for immigration adjudications, all based on the assumption that the government wants to deport a given individual.</span> Thus, 8 U.S.C. § 1229, begins by requiring that the alien receive written notice of the case against him or her. And 8 U.S.C. § 1229a lays out all sorts of details surrounding the conduct of the proceedings that follow. But what do these provisions---the first of which is entitled "Initiation of removal proceedings"---say about the obligation of authorities to, well, initiate removal proceedings? Exactly nothing. They simply assume that the immigration authorities want the person in question removed from the country. Nothing in either provision requires that authorities do, in fact, want him or her removed or start a case against him or her. And nothing that I can see forbids the president from directing that his underlings stay their hands in initiating removal proceedings, either in individual cases or in whole classes of cases. In the immigration context, Congress certainly knows how to remove discretion from the attorney general. In 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c), for example, <span class='card-underline'>the legislature bluntly directs that "The Attorney General shall take into custody any alien" who has committed certain classes of crimes pending </span><span class='card-underline'>deportation.a</span> A provision that follows mandates the detention of suspected alien terrorists. And 8 U.S.C. § 1231 directs that "when an alien is ordered removed, the Attorney General shall remove the alien from the United States within a period of 90 days." During that time, authorities "shall detain the alien. Under no circumstance during the removal period shall [they] release an alien who has been found inadmissible . . . or . . . deportable." So one has to assume that the silence as to any sort of requirement that the government initiate deportation proceedings against non-criminal aliens is not an accident. It is a grant of discretion of sorts. To be sure, it was probably a grant of discretion predicated on the assumption that presidents would want to remove deportable aliens from the country. <span class='card-underline'>The idea that a president would build a whole programmatic policy edifice out of the discretion that resides in this silence surely never crossed anyone's mind. That said, I can't see any legal impediment to President Obama's anticipated course of action.</span> I am no immigration law expert, so that fact may not mean all that much. <span class='card-underline'>If some reader out there who has studied the statute has a theory as to why the President lacks discretion to decline to initiate five million removal actions, I'd love to hear it.

The Supreme Court prevented Obama from allowing undocumented immigrants — in this case those who have American-born children — to work legally in the United States. Because the president was seeking the authority to change the legal status of an entire class of individuals — something that Congress is supposed to control — it is unsurprising that the courts objected. Yet, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>there are many cases in which presidents have unilaterally changed immigration polic</span></span><span class='card-underline'>y</span>. Consider one lesser known measure. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Until around 2010, the vast majority of those apprehended trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico border without authorization were subject to “voluntary removal,” the much-maligned practice</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>also known as catch-and-release</span></span> under which the person apprehended is transported out of the United States with no further legal repercussion. <span class='card-underline'>The Border Patrol has since phased out this practice and largely replaced it with “expedited removal,” which involves a formal writ of deportation that impedes a person from obtaining a legal entry visa for five years or more</span>. <span class='card-underline'>This change in tactic might seem like a bit of bureaucratic arcana but it has had real impact on the lives of migrants and on migration patterns</span>. Previously, many would-be migrants who had applied for a green card would enter the United States illegally to live and work while they waited out the half decade or more it takes to clear the queue for a permanent residence visa. For these individuals, being an undocumented immigrant was just one part of the migration life cycle. <span class='card-underline'>By raising the legal stakes of being apprehended, the switch from voluntary to expedited removal has made prospective legal immigrants wary about entering the country through any means other than legal channels.</span> <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>There are </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>many further actions a future president could take without congressional authorization</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> that would directly or indirectly raise barriers to immigratio</span></span><span class='card-underline'>n. </span>These include conducting more surprise raids of farms and factories where undocumented migrants are known to work, more aggressively pursuing fines on employers found to have hired undocumented immigrants, engineering longer delays in obtaining a green card, and the list goes on.

How do they allocate the power over immigration between the three branches of government? <span class='card-underline'>The Declaration of Independence speaks directly on immigration</span>. In fact, <span class='card-underline'>one of the Founders’ grievances against King George was that he was limiting immigration</span>, by trying “to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither . . .” But when the Constitution became the law of the land more than a decade after the signing of the Declaration, immigration was a lesser issue. <span class='card-underline'>The Constitution only mentions immigration once, stating that Congress has no power to limit the migration of slaves until 1808—it is silent about limiting any other migration, although it gives Congress the power to create a uniform rule of naturalization. </span>In the decades after the ratification of the Constitution, the Supreme Court took a leading role in determining how the immigration power would be allocated between the three branches of Government. <span class='card-underline'>In the end, the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Court gave “plenary power</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>”—</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>absolute power—over immigration to Congress and the Executive</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>, in a judicially-created doctrine known as the “plenary power” doctrine</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. Although this concept is found nowhere in the Constitution, the Supreme Court said Congress had the power to make immigration laws that were discriminatory and otherwise unfair. In later years, the Court has also allowed Congress to delegate its immigration authority to the Executive Branch. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Congress has now given away much of its plenary power over immigration to the Executive</span></span><span class='card-underline'> in sweeping grants of power—more sweeping grants than in any other area of the law</span>. For example<span class='card-underline'>, Congress has delegated the power to the Executive Branch to determine whether the United States is at war such that military members can be naturalized;</span> to determine <span class='card-underline'>whether foreigners should be granted temporary protected status</span>; to determine <span class='card-underline'>whether a person is allowed to work in the United States</span>; to <span class='card-underline'>grant a person permission to be in the U.S. when the person does not qualify for a visa; and to decide whether a person’s deportation should be deferred. As a result of two judicially-created developments—the plenary power doctrine, and the doctrine that Congress may delegate its power to the President—</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the Executive Branch today enjoys expansive power over immigration</span></span>. Many people recently became upset when the Executive Branch exercised these powers delegated to it by Congress—<span class='card-underline'>but until Congress amends or repeals these broad grants of authority to the Executive, the President is on firm legal ground. President Barack Obama has come under fire for using the authority granted to him by Congress and ratified by the Supreme Court’s plenary power doctrine</span>. He has faced a firestorm of criticism from both sides of the political aisle. His use of his authority harkens back to an earlier Democratic President—Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who was President of the United States when the Supreme Court abandoned the non-delegation doctrine in favor of allowing Congress to cede its powers to the President. <span class='card-underline'>Since FDR’s time, the balance of power in areas such as foreign affairs, national security, and immigration has tilted strongly towards the Executive Branch</span>—with explicit and implicit authority from Congress and the gloss of history only strengthening the Executive’s power. Like FDR, President Obama has used his executive authority in controversial ways. His “national security” rationale for holding Central American refugees in detention camps has drawn comparisons to FDR’s often-criticized detention of Japanese residents during World War II. President Obama has also been criticized for deferring the deportations of young people who have graduated from U.S. high schools. And finally, he has been sued for attempting to give temporary work permits to the parents of U.S. citizen children so that those parents can work to support their families, rather than relying on public handouts. In the end, the Court-created doctrines that have allowed his predecessors to exercise these same powers are likely to ratify his actions, however controversial and seemingly unconstitutional they may seem to the casual observer. When it comes to immigration law and policy, the Founding documents no longer control America’s destiny—rather, <span class='card-underline'>the ever-evolving doctrines of the United States Supreme Court, and the dysfunction of Congress, have left the </span><span class='card-underline'>immigration power firmly in Executive hands.</span></p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>No Tyranny – 4 checks on presidential power</div><div class='cite'>Goldstein ‘99 (Joel K., Prof. Of Law, St. Louis Univ., The Presidency and the Rule of Law: Some Preliminary Explorations, 43 St. Louis L.J. 791, Summer) </div><div class='card-body'><p> Would these concessions to executive interpretive autonomy leave us naked before a Chief Executive prone to self-aggrandizement?

Relatedly, <span class='card-underline'>these state and local policies can constrain the policy choices politically available to a future group of federal legislators. This was certainly true in</span> the case of <span class='card-underline'>DACA</span>, as <span class='card-underline'>actions by the Executive prompted most states to reexamine and modify their policies on driver’s licenses</span>, the overwhelming majority of which previously required proof of legal presence in the United States.374 Moreover, beyond licenses, <span class='card-underline'>other important state and local areas for immigrant integration, such as local identification cards, state tuition policies, public welfare provision, and even health care, have all witnessed accelerated momentum after DACA</span>.375 This Article does not claim that the Obama Administration intended these state-level policy changes when it implemented DACA. Indeed, there is no mention of state driver’s licenses in any of the federal government’s documents outlining the contours of DACA or its effects on potential beneficiaries or state and local jurisdictions.376 At the same time, the <span class='card-underline'>administrative creation of</span> a large class of <span class='card-underline'>persons</span> who now are <span class='card-underline'>temporarily lawfully present despite</span> their <span class='card-underline'>unlawful status</span> virtually <span class='card-underline'>necessitated some state-level response.</span>377 With a group of a few hundred thousand DACA recipients openly attending schools and seeking employment, and needing transportation to take advantage of both,378 <span class='card-underline'>DACA helped ease the policy climate for states desirous of accounting for all residents, regardless of immigration status</span>. This process—an exogenous shock (this one prompted by the President’s decision on DACA) provoking a rash of changes in state policies on driver’s licenses—comports very closely with what Professors Frank Baumgartner and Bryan Jones have called a “punctuated equilibrium,” in which an exogenous development upends a status quo of policy inertia, which subsequently catalyzes processes that propel toward rapid change.379 The President’s action on DACA is exogenous because the Administration was not seeking to change state policy on driver’s licenses when it announced its policy in June 2012.380 Additionally, the policy reverberations from the 2012 executive action continue. As DACA recipients renew their status and continue to establish deep ties to their communities through education, work, and family ties, they appear more and more as a permanently non-deportable group.

In the wake of the President’s second largescale deferred action program, more than twenty mayors (mostly, if not exclusively, from the Democratic Party) formed the Cities United for Immigration Action collective386 and met in New York City to discuss the implementation of inclusive, immigrant-friendly policies consistent with the President’s actions.387 Not only do these mayors represent a “coalition of the willing” in support of executive action, consisting of forty-eight jurisdictions and more than 25 million residents,388 they also mark the building of a policy network that has the potential to outlast the Obama Presidency. As Professor Judith Resnick notes, these types of translocal governmental organizations can cross territorial lines to help shape and spread policies.389 In this way—and often with the help of policy entrepreneurs—federalism takes on a horizontal dimension,390 in addition to its vertical component and its separation of powers possibilities. <span class='card-underline'>This horizontal dimension from state to state and city to city can, and likely will, create feedback loops and inform the scope and substance of any future federal legislation.</span>391 <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Congress will be constrained to either accommodating these integrationist impulses at the state and local levels or attempting to override them at the cost of disregarding the political will of several dispersed jurisdictions</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span>392 To extend the metaphor of the President seeking to entrench his policy vision, <span class='card-underline'>complementary state policies on immigration can help deepen the roots of executive action on immigration, making it far more difficult for Congress to eradicate or significantly alter such policies with subsequent legislation.</span> Surely, this kind of “rooting” can also happen through other means, such as the mobilization of public opinion among policy beneficiaries393 and supportive actions by nonprofits.394 However, <span class='card-underline'>state complementary action can be stronger and more enduring than popular mobilization because the former is institutionalized through state legislation and policy implementation, while the latter must rely on private actors overcoming problems of collective action among potential beneficiaries.</span> Also, state complementary action on presidential action is likely stronger than supportive actions by nonprofits, which do not have the same benefits of democratic legitimacy and accountability, the ability to raise revenues in a diffuse and predictable manner, the coercive force of law, or the ability to operate throughout a state rather than only in areas where immigrants are numerous.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Parole is not normal means</div><div class='cite'>Murphy ‘8 (Sarah E.

Although the difference between "extraordinary," "exceptional," and "skilled" may seem trivial in any other context, these labels have a profound effect on aspiring immigrants.</span> n57 The highly meritocratic system of visa allocations must be reexamined in light of this situation.</p><p>II. Negative Effects of a Hyper-Meritocratic EB Immigration Regime</p><p><span class='card-underline'>The hyper-meritocracy of the current EB immigration regime is problematic</span> for three main reasons: <span class='card-underline'>its furtherance of global brain </span><span class='card-underline'>drain</span><span class='card-underline'>, its failure to optimize U.S. economic interests</span>, and the undemocratic and "un-American" value judgment that underlies it.</p><p>A. Global Brain Drain</p><p>The phenomenon of international brain drain is based on two premises: there are few highly educated people in developing nations,  [*936]  and those highly educated people are extremely likely to emigrate. n58 It is defined as a "significant loss of the highly educated population" resulting in negative economic effects in the sending country. n59 These negative effects are often twofold, including a loss of human capital as well as a loss of the government's return on its investment in its citizenry. n60 For example, a developing country may invest significant amounts of money in educating and providing healthcare to its youths on the understanding that they will mature into informed, healthy, and productive members of the national society. n61 That understanding collateralizes the investment. n62 Whenever a highly skilled, highly educated citizen emigrates, the country enters a loss on its ledger.</p><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Although it is understandable that the best and brightest of a developing nation emigrate for a better life and additional opportunities, this </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>strips the sending nation</span></span> (perhaps more aptly described as the deprived nation) <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>of valuable resources necessary for continuing development</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> In this regard, <span class='card-underline'>African countries have been acutely affected, and widespread emigration from the continent </span><span class='card-underline'>"</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>threatens Africa with yet another net loss of quality human resources" </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>similar to</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> the effect of the slave trade</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> n63 <span class='card-underline'>One scholar estimates that twenty to fifty percent of the "top African brains and skilled personnel" have left the continent and fail to retain significant professional ties with their homelands.</span> n64 The 2005 World Migration Report, compiled by the International Organization for Migration, called attention to the loss of human resources from the continent, a trend which one scholar predicts will culminate in Africa's transformation into an "intellectually barren ghetto." n65</p><p>By contrast, developed countries benefit greatly from this continual injection of brains and talent, and they even compete with each other over immigrant candidates. n66 As Professor Ayelet Shachar, of  [*937]  the law faculty at the University of Toronto, explains, "industrial countries are trying to outbid one another ... to attract highly skilled migrants to their domestic industries in order to gain (or retain) a relative advantage over their international competitors in the knowledge-based global economy." n67 From this perspective, encouraging highly skilled immigration becomes yet another strategy in the broad reach of a developed country's economy. n68 Reflecting upon this conceptualization of the immigrant as human capital, Professor Kunal M. Parker, of Cleveland-Marshall College of Law, aptly concludes that receiving countries measure the value of an aspiring immigrant based on her profile as "homo oeconomicus." n69 Thus, brain drain is the inevitable symptom of a widespread "reimagination of legal immigration in terms of productivity, skill, resources, and self-sufficiency." n70</p><p><span class='card-underline'>The</span> <span class='card-underline'>U</span>nited <span class='card-underline'>S</span>tates <span class='card-underline'>is the most popular destination country for skilled immigrants</span>, n71 and it is easy to imagine why. The nation boasts expansive opportunities for the well-educated and highly skilled, and its immigration policies reward such a showing of talent. Admittedly, arguments appealing to international concerns often do not fare well in shaping U.S. laws. n72 U.S. immigration law is, without illusion, designed with the goal of furthering U.S. interests. n73 Critics of U.S. immigration policy have often urged an even stronger preferencing of  [*938]  elite immigrants rather than tempering the meritocracy. n74 This position is understandable and in no sense irrational from either a legal or policy perspective; after all, the United States was arguably founded on the ideas that social mobility was possible and that hard work and high achievement would be rewarded. n75</p><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Brain drain</span></span> is detrimental, however, even with purely domestic goals in mind: it <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>directly undercuts U.S. foreign policy regarding global development and democracy promotion </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>and also</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> subverts border control policy aimed at reducing unauthorized entrie</span></span><span class='card-underline'>s</span>. The United States Agency for International Development ("USAID") states its "twofold purpose" as "furthering America's foreign policy interests in expanding democracy and free markets while improving the lives of the citizens of the developing world." n76 It is the main U.S. governmental agency charged with promoting economic and democracy development around the globe. n77 USAID is not unaware of the benefits and detriments of brain drain. In a presentation to USAID on the relationship between migration and development, the Migration Policy Institute emphasized the "potential [domestic] benefits of a 'brain export' industry," while at the same time acknowledging that efforts to repatriate such highly skilled immigrants - and thus mitigate the negative effects in sending countries - have generally failed. n78</p><p>[*939]  <span class='card-underline'>Although</span><span class='card-underline'> remittances by highly skilled and highly educated migrants may contribute to economic development in sending countries, it is harder to assert that these remittances similarly contribute to democracy promotion</span>, which has become a prominent focus of USAID policy since 2002. n79 <span class='card-underline'>Democracy</span>, especially in contrast to other forms of governance, <span class='card-underline'>requires a certain financial stability and economic security in governmental entities</span>; the populace relies on the state to provide healthcare, educate the nation's youth, and, at least to some extent, redistribute wealth. n80 <span class='card-underline'>Democratic governments must also exercise self-determination over their economic policies, a significant feat in the current international political economy.</span> n81 <span class='card-underline'>The</span><span class='card-underline'> infrastructure and bureaucratic capabilities necessary to accomplish these stepping stones to democracy rely on an educated, informed citizenry</span><span class='card-underline'>, which must fill the roles of leaders and constituencies.</span> <span class='card-underline'>Promoting "brain export" hardly seems consistent with promoting democracy, and, therefore, the </span><span class='card-underline'>U</span>nited <span class='card-underline'>S</span>tates <span class='card-underline'>impairs its own global policy goals with its domestic immigration law</span>. n82</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Border control policy is also underserved by an EB immigration system that engenders brain drain. Immigration is often motivated by a lack of employment and economic opportunity in the home country</span>, n83 <span class='card-underline'>and the current allocation of EB-3 visas serves only a fraction of aspiring EB-3 immigrants.</span> n84 Although the intent behind these statutory restrictions is likely to recalibrate the nature of the immigrant  [*940]  flow, n85 the result is a near trainwreck of supply and demand curves. <span class='card-underline'>Rather than abandoning all intention of emigrating and remaining in their home countries, immigrants who would otherwise be EB-3s are more likely to violate border policies and pursue U.S. employment opportunities outside of the law.</span> n86</p><p>EB immigration law largely attempts to restrict entry to all but the most elite, but the policy carries significant negative externalities. <span class='card-underline'>By extracting the highly educated and highly skilled from nations around the globe, it </span><span class='card-underline'>stifles international development</span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> Thus, <span class='card-underline'>populations remain relatively unskilled and opportunities in sending countries remain limited. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>These unskilled, aspiring immigrants develop the logical desire to immigrate to the</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>U</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>nited </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>S</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>tates </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>and, undaunted by tight restrictions on their visa category, arrive without authorization</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.

In August, the president endorsed <span class='card-underline'>the RAISE Act, which would slash legal immigration in half and establish a point system for those considered higher-skilled. </span>Meanwhile, the administration is also scrutinizing several other Obama-era rules that help high-skilled foreigners live and work in the U.S. Some <span class='card-underline'>rules on the chopping block include those designed to benefit startup entrepreneurs, spouses of H-1B visa holders, and foreign students who graduated with a degree in scientific or technical fields.</span><span class='card-underline'> </span>The administration has also issued a series of memos that have the effect of making it harder for H-1B applicants to qualify. <span class='card-underline'>“</span><span class='card-underline'>It would be </span><span class='card-underline'>more sincere</span><span class='card-underline'> to have a proposal that would </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>take the numbers of the diversity visa and put them toward employment-based immigration</span></span><span class='card-underline'>,” </span>Anderson said. “But all their advocacy is for fewer people coming in. Period.” Following the attack, Trump chided Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., because he supported the diversity visa program when it was enacted nearly 30 years ago. On Twitter, Schumer shot back: “President Trump should be focusing on the real solution — anti-terrorism funding,” he wrote. “Pres Trump, instead of politicizing & dividing America which he always seems to do at times of national tragedy, should bring us together.”</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>The counterplan solves and shows bipartisan support</div><div class='cite'>Nowrasteh 17 (Alex Nowrasteh, "Diversity Visa Program Fixes that Should Satisfy Republicans and Democrats", Cato Institute, 1-20-2018, accessed 7-11-2018, https://www.cato.org/blog/diversity-visa-program-fixes-will-satisfy-republicans-democrats) //AL</div><div class='card-body'><p>Legalizing the DREAMers, building the wall, boosting border security, and reforming the diversity immigrant visa program are the components of a successful legislative deal to reopen the federal government. Reforming the diversity visa presents some unique challenges because Congress does not want to cut the number of green cards, but many Democrats–especially members of the Black and Hispanic Congressional Caucuses–worry that any substantial change to the program would diminish the number of immigrants from the nations that are favored under the current system. Fortunately, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>there is a policy solution that should satisfy both sides: convert the diversity visa into a merit-based system that still favors immigrants from the regions of the world that qualify for the diversity visa</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> Before explaining this reform idea and how it would satisfy both political parties, some background on the diversity immigrant visa program is necessary. This immigration category allocates 50,000 green cards annually to foreign nationals, distributed by lottery. These green cards go only to applicants from low-admission countries that sent fewer than 50,000 immigrants to the United States in the last five years. Lottery winners must have at least a high school education or demonstrate two years of work experience within the past five years in an occupation that requires at least two years of training or experience. Applicants must also pass the required health, crime, and national security checks. No more than 7 percent of all winners can come from any one country in a given year. <span class='card-underline'>The first portion of this reform idea would make many Republicans happy by canceling the diversity visa program and shifting those 50,000 green cards to a new merit-based green card category that would allocate the visas via a points system.</span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>The assignment of points under this immigration category is up to Congress</span>, but copying the system outlined by Senators Tom Cotton (R-AR) and David Perdue (R-GA) in the RAISE Act would take a lot of ire out of their opposition.

These trends <span class='card-underline'>show the mean number of immigrants by year, and type of migration, in the past one and a half decades</span>. Appendix A shows summary measures describing the nonweighted number of emigrants from African countries with selected characteristics. According to Figure I, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>there was an approximately 300 percent increase in the number of African emigrants to the U.S. between 1992 and 2007</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. Yet, despite these increases, considerable variations are found</span> in the trends associated with specific types of migration flows. For example, <span class='card-underline'>there were systematic annual increases</span> in the <span class='card-underline'>migration</span> of African refugees <span class='card-underline'>during the latter part of the 1990s</span>. In fact, by the year 2000 African refugee migration was among the top two types of migration flows driving overall African emigration to the U.S. There were, however, abrupt declines in these trends between 2001 and 2002 as a result of the temporary suspension of the U.S. refugee resettlement program after the September 11 attacks (Bruno, 2006). However, these trends rebounded around 2003 ⁄ 2004 but have since been on the decline. <span class='card-underline'>Figure I also </span><span class='card-underline'>points</span><span class='card-underline'> to the possible impact of the DV program on overall African immigration trends. Although the program was enacted as part of the Immigration Act of 1990, the first DV immigrants arrived in the U.S. in 1995</span>. As Figure I suggests, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>DV migration appears to increase the overall trend in the number of African immigrants</span></span><span class='card-underline'> from a mean of below 400 before 1995, to about 600 and above in the </span><span class='card-underline'>later</span><span class='card-underline'> half of the 1990s</span>. <span class='card-underline'>African nationals are</span>, however, <span class='card-underline'>less likely to emigrate to the U.S. as part of family-reunification processes or strictly for purposes of employment</span>. At the same time, <span class='card-underline'>disparate trends are observed in African emigration for family or employment-related reasons</span>. For example, the results show consistent increases in the mean number of Africans emigrating as the immediate relatives of U.S. citizens. A possible explanation for these increases is that earlier cohorts of African immigrants may be increasingly fulfilling the residency requirement for U.S. citizenship thus becoming more legally eligible to sponsor the migration of their immediate kin. Emigration of nonimmediate family members, however, occurs on a much smaller scale. <span class='card-underline'>Contrary to expectations, few highly skilled individuals are emigrating from Africa to the U.S. through formal employment preferences</span>. As Figure I suggests, trends in African emigration for employment reasons slightly declined between 1992 and 2007.¶ Results from the regression analysis of the determinants of overall trends are presented in Table 1. Descriptive statistics for the dependent variables used in the models are found in Appendix B. In Table 1, Model 1 only presents an estimate for the year coefficient, allowing us to capture the gross annual change in the overall emigration rate. The <span class='card-underline'>results indicate that on average emigration from Africa to the U.S. significantly increased</span> by 6 percent per year between 1992 and 2007. <span class='card-underline'>This overall trend</span>, according to Model 2, <span class='card-underline'>seems significantly associated with</span> specific trends in at least two of the three major types of emigration flows, i.e., refugee migration and <span class='card-underline'>the DV migration</span>. Yet, controlling for the influence of the three major flows results in only a slight reduction in the overall annual emigration trend. <span class='card-underline'>Model 2 further suggests that in absolute terms, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>DV migration had a greater average impact on overall trends than either refugee migration or the migration of immediate family members</span></span>. In fact, the average contribution of refugee migration is about four times higher than the contributions associated with the other flows accounted for in Model 2.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Shortages of skilled workers and professionals pose serious structural crises to stability across the continent </div><div class='cite'>Soergel 16—Andrew Soergel, senior reporter, 2016 (“Sub-Saharan Africa Bleeds Skilled Labor as 'Brain Drain' Continues,” US News and World Report, 10-07-2016, Available Online at https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2016-10-07/sub-saharan-africa-bleeds-skilled-labor-as-brain-drain-continues, Accessed 07-16-2018)//hk</div><div class='card-body'><p><span class='card-underline'>BURIED IN THE International Monetary Fund's</span> massive 289-page <span class='card-underline'>World Economic Outlook report</span> released earlier this week <span class='card-underline'>is a small line about a big problem for the labor markets of sub-Saharan Africa.</span><span class='card-underline'>¶</span> <span class='card-underline'>A region of the world that the World Bank believed was home to more than 1 billion people in 2015 is suffering from what the IMF refers to as a "</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>brain drain" as young, skilled workers depart from the region, leaving educated and technically proficient professionals in short supply</span></span>.¶ <span class='card-underline'>The exodus of young, educated workers is taking a toll on a region where human capital is scarce</span>, the report said. "<span class='card-underline'>The migration of highly skilled workers entails a high social cost</span>, as is evidenced by the <span class='card-underline'>departure of doctors and nurses from Malawi and Zimbabwe</span>, which <span class='card-underline'>may mean welfare losses beyond those that are purely economic</span>."¶ <span class='card-underline'>Reasons for migration vary by country</span>. The refugees that in recent decades have fled violence in Rwanda, for example, would be considered "humanitarian" migrants by the IMF. Those leaving countries such as Zimbabwe for better employment opportunities would be classified as "economic" or "voluntary" migrants.¶ <span class='card-underline'>It's unfair to paint the diverse economies of sub-Saharan Africa with the same brush. But regardless of one's reason for leaving, data clearly supports the notion that sub-Saharan African populations are shedding workers that could potentially serve as doctors, engineers and skilled employees domestically</span>.¶ The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs in 2013 estimated that <span class='card-underline'>one </span><span class='card-underline'>in nine people born in Africa with a post-secondary education had migrated to a developed nation outside of the African continent</span>. The United State's own African-born population is believed to have doubled in each decade since 1970, according to the Census Bureau.¶ As a result, there aren't enough skilled workers to go around in many sub-Saharan African countries. The World Health Organization estimates <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Zimbabwe held only 0.08 physicians per 1,000 people in the country's population</span></span>. <span class='card-underline'>Malawi</span> in 2009 <span class='card-underline'>held only 0.019 physicians per 1,000 people</span>, while <span class='card-underline'>Mauritania's concentration sat at 0.</span><span class='card-underline'>13.</span><span class='card-underline'>¶</span> For comparison's sake, <span class='card-underline'>the U.S. held 2.45 doctors per 1,000 people</span> in 2011<span class='card-underline'>. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>A general lack of skilled and technically advanced workers such as </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>doctors</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> leaves countries susceptible to medical and infrastructural emergencies</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>This was highlighted</span></span> in 2014 <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>when</span></span> the deadly <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Ebola</span></span> virus <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>ravaged Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea</span></span> – which didn't have nearly enough in-house medical personnel to effectively treat and contain the epidemic. <span class='card-underline'>The most recent data from these three countries indicates they held no more than 0.1 physicians per 1,000 citizens.</span><span class='card-underline'>¶</span> Scott Firsing, who's currently an adjunct professor at the University of North Carolina's Wilmington campus and who spent nearly a decade working and conducting research in South Africa, broke down World Bank data in a January blog post for the London School of Economics and Political Science, noting that African migration doubled between 1980 and 2010, while the percentage of those migrants who elected to stay in Africa steadily declined.¶ But he says those estimates are far from all-encompassing.¶ "The problem is, the data is difficult to break down. The immigration between a lot of these countries is really nonexistent," Firsing says, "It's a statistical nightmare, this movement. People say there are more and more opportunities back in Africa, but what I found, particularly among my friends who went off to work in Australia … they're getting picked up left, right and center from Africa."¶ Part of the reason for migration, he says, is a lack of opportunity – both professionally and in the realm of education. He says it's common for young, aspiring professionals to travel to Europe, the U.S. or Australia to further their education.¶ "<span class='card-underline'>In Africa, you don't really see that connection between the private sector and the universities. You don't have government funding poured into the universities. You don't have the skilled professors at the universities</span>," he says. "They don't have people to actually teach them. And if they do, they end up just leaving."¶ Even South Africa – a country that serves as a destination point for many African migrants from the north – is suffering the effects of a brain drain. Competition from China has "decimated" the country's once vibrant manufacturing sector, Firsing says, and other opportunities for skilled workers have left the country as industries requiring such expertise have dried up.¶ And for those who already left for school or work in other countries, it's often difficult to justify returning, he says. <span class='card-underline'>Remittance payments are still an important source of cash for many in sub-Saharan Africa, but even the most homesick and patriotic expats may find it difficult to return </span><span class='card-underline'>home</span>.¶ "<span class='card-underline'>If they're in a pretty decent paying job and they're pretty settled</span>, you know how it is. <span class='card-underline'>It's tough to say, 'Ok, let's pack up and make the move again.'</span> It's taxing on money and emotions and all that," Firsing says.¶ <span class='card-underline'>The IMF report notes that there is some evidence of skilled African expatriates eventually trickling back</span> to their <span class='card-underline'>home</span> nations, bringing with them "new skills" to those economies. <span class='card-underline'>And the remittance payments</span> others provide <span class='card-underline'>allow those living overseas to help address poverty and support their families</span> in their home nation, even if they're not personally stimulating that labor market.¶ <span class='card-underline'>But the outflow of skilled labor and young</span> <span class='card-underline'>people seeking higher levels of education is still worrying</span> enough for the IMF to highlight.

That’s why conservation ecologists Joshua Daskin and Robert Pringle, from Yale and Princeton Universities, respectively, decided to look at at African protected areas and compare known, long-term population trajectories of big herbivores with the relative degree and frequency of armed conflict.</p><p>A continent-wide examination of Africa’s protected spaces was a natural choice for the research team.

Indeed, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>considerable increases in African emigration to the U.S. occurred during</span></span> much of <span class='card-underline'>1980s, which was a period of declining African economic performance</span>, otherwise referred to as the lost decade (Michaels, 1992 ⁄ 1993; Easterly, 2001; Hope, 2002). <span class='card-underline'>Wilson and </span><span class='card-underline'>Habecker</span> (2008) thus <span class='card-underline'>identify the failure of economic development in Africa as a crucial determinant of contemporary</span> African <span class='card-underline'>emigration to the U.S</span>. Likewise, <span class='card-underline'>Hatton and Williamson</span> (2003) <span class='card-underline'>argue that slow</span> economic <span class='card-underline'>growth increases the pressure to migrate from Africa to high-income countries</span>. <span class='card-underline'>Africa’s economic failures are</span> also <span class='card-underline'>associated with the lack of basic infrastructure, increasing poverty, and high levels of unemployment</span> (Lugalla, 1997; Potts, 2000; Kates and Dasgupta, 2007). One consequence of these transformations is that Africans now dream ‘‘of enjoying the better life in the U.S.’’ (Nwoye, 2009:96), or expect to migrate to other destinations in the West to achieve their desired higher living standards (Van Dalen, Groenewold, and Schoorl, 2005).¶ <span class='card-underline'>Increasingly, neo-classical type explanations are</span> also <span class='card-underline'>being used in research on contemporary trends in skilled migration, or the ‘‘</span><span class='card-underline'>braindrain</span><span class='card-underline'>,’’ from Africa to the U.</span>S.

His basic premise is that <span class='card-underline'>migration flows are a product of the immigration laws of states</span> (Zolberg, 1999). States, for example, can set numerical limits on immigrant admissions and determine the characteristics of immigrants allowed to live within their borders. Thus, as the historical evidence demonstrates, the first phase of African migration to the U.S. was brought to an end by state laws abolishing the legal trade in slaves. Similarly, the U.S. state, through the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, abolished pre-1960 immigration quotas, thereby providing new opportunities for Africans to emigrate to the U.S. Yet, the evidence suggests that this action resulted in limited increases in African migration to the U.S. immediately following the 1960s compared with the increases observed at the end of the century. More <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>generally, </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>a number of</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> scholars</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>(e.g., Lobo, 2001; KonaduAgyemang and Takyi, 2006) <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>argue that the surge in African immigration to the U.S. reflects the impacts of the U.S. Diversity Visa (DV) Program</span></span> created as part of the 1990 immigration reforms. This program, which seeks to increase immigration from nontraditional sending countries, was implemented in the mid-1990s and has facilitated the migration of approximately 20,000 Africans per year since its inception (KonaduAgyemang and Takyi, 2006). Conceptually, however, the legal framework of destination states does not preclude variations in migration trends between origin and destination countries. These variations can occur, for example, as a result of structural changes in origin countries that affect the incentive to migrate across time.¶ <span class='card-underline'>World Systems theory</span> (Wallerstein, 1974, 1980) also <span class='card-underline'>provides useful insights into the likely determinants of African migration to the U.S.</span> As Massey et al. (1998) note, <span class='card-underline'>early proponents of the theory focused on the ‘‘brain-drain’’ as a product of Western exploitation of developing countries. However, the dynamics of African emigration to the West can also be understood within the context of two further implications</span> of the World Systems theory. The first stems from the fact that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the theory considers migration to be a product of the penetration of capitalist economic relationships into less-developed countries</span></span>. Accordingly, <span class='card-underline'>as wealthy multinational corporations penetrate poorer countries</span> (e.g., those in Africa) <span class='card-underline'>they create mobile populations through processes of labor displacement</span> (Massey et al., 1998). Secondly, World Systems theory also suggests that <span class='card-underline'>emigration from Africa to the West is driven by cultural and ideological linkages created by the latter during the period of colonial rule in Africa</span> (Fonseca 2000; Thierry, 2004; Castles and Miller, 2009). Linkages created by British Colonialists, for example, resulted in the adoption of English as the official language spoken in their former colonies in Africa. Given the role of linguistic proficiency in determining postimmigration success, World Systems theory would hypothesize that contemporary African migration to the U.S. will be driven by emigration flows from English than non-English-speaking African countries.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>There is a direct correlation between an increase in DV-based immigration and deteriorating economic conditions in sending countries</div><div class='cite'>Jones 09—Adzele K Jones, 2009 (“Togo on my Mind,” The New African Diaspora, Indiana UP, 2009, ISBN 978-0-253-35337-5, p. 61-77, Accessed 07-08-2018)//hk </div><div class='card-body'><p><span class='card-underline'>Although most Africans migrate to Europe, mainly because of lasting colonial ties, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>recent records have shown a great trend of African migration to the United States.

Others sought opportunities in Germany, the earlier colonial power. <span class='card-underline'>There was a relatively small number of Togolese immigrants in the United States. But this number has shown a substantial increase since the late 1990s</span>. The graph below shows the scale of deviation from the average for Togolese and African immigrants to the U.S. from 1995 to 2004. <span class='card-underline'>It indicates that, in more recent years, there has been a relatively greater increase in Togolese immigrants than in those from the general African </span><span class='card-underline'>population</span>.¶ Although migrants may leave their homeland in search of better opportunities elsewhere, the country in which they settle also benefits from their presence. In fact, many countries campaign and employ strategies to attract them. As Gumisai Mutume states, industrial countries need migrants because they often face labor shortages in highly skilled areas such as information technology and health services, as well as for trade jobs in agriculture, manufacturing, and construction (Mutume 15). On the whole, Africans who immigrate to the U.S. or Europe are usually well- educated or skilled professionals.¶ According to Rotimi Sankore, <span class='card-underline'>the U.S. Diversity Visa Program recruits skilled and educated Africans</span> (4). <span class='card-underline'>It is estimated that 30 percent of sub- Saharan Africa’s highly skilled workers and professionals left their countries for Europe and the United States between the years of 1960 and 1989. In addition, a third of all college graduates left the continent</span>. As Gordon points out, <span class='card-underline'>20–50 percent of skilled and professional Africans leave the continent, while the less skilled migrate to neighboring countries</span> (86). It is reported by Hal Kane that <span class='card-underline'>there are more Togolese doctors in France than in Togo</span> (39).¶ Africans enter the United States in many ways.

Ghana lost 60 percent of its medical doctors in the 1980s, while between 600and 700 Ghanaian physicians are currently practicing in the US</span> alone, and this figure represents roughly 50 per cent of the doctors in Ghana. In 1993, the UNDP Human Development Report showed that <span class='card-underline'>over 21,000 Nigerian medical doctors were practicing in the USA</span> alone, <span class='card-underline'>while Nigeria has an acute shortage of doctors</span>. When we add the other Nigerian doctors in diaspora e.g. in Saudi Arabia, the Gulf States, Europe, Canada, Australia and those scattered all over other African countries, the figure could be 30,000 (Brain Drain in Africa: Facts and Figures, Ibid: It is noted that these figures is a gross under-estimation of the facts on the ground).¶ In Ethiopia, one-third of its medical doctors have already left the country. As Randal Tobias, <span class='card-underline'>the US Government’s Global AIDS Coordinator, states, “there are more Ethiopian-trained doctors practicing in the city of Chicago alone than in Ethiopia</span>. In Zambia the situation is not better off, as only 50 out of the 600 doctors trained in the country’s medical school from 1978 – 1999 could be retained- by the public sector.

For example, <span class='card-underline'>the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>WHO General Director considered that </span></span><span class='card-highlight'>“</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>countries need their skilled workforce to stay</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>so that their professional expertise can benefit the population. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>When</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>health <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>workers leave</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>to work elsewhere, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>there is a loss of hope and a loss of years of investment</span></span>” (WHO, 2006, p. 8).7 No comprehensive data documenting the amount of the training costs of skilled African migrants exist. However, <span class='card-underline'>different sources suggest that those costs might be substantial</span>. For example, <span class='card-underline'>the UNCTAD has estimated that each African professional migrant represents, on average, a loss of US$184,000 to Africa</span> (see, among others, Oyowe 1996; Pang et al. 2002; Eastwood et al. 2005; Kirigia et al. 2006; Mugimu 2010). Despite the fact that this estimate is widely cited, we should keep in mind that it has not been updated in more than 15 years. Consequently, it should be considered as an approximation. <span class='card-underline'>A number of</span><span class='card-underline'> case studies quantify the losses for African countries associated with the migration of the highly skilled</span>. For example, the financial cost due to the migration of 600 South African medical graduates to New Zealand was estimated at US$37 million (Mugimu 2010). The total cost of education from primary to university of a non-specialist medical doctor in Malawi was estimated at US$56,947 (Muula and Panulo 2007) and 65,997 US dollars for Kenya (Kirigia et al. 2006).8 <span class='card-underline'>In 2004, Ghana alone lost approximately £35 million spent on training of health professionals who left the country</span> for the UK. In contrast, the recruitment of Ghanaian doctors resulted in approximately £65 million of savings in training costs in the UK between 1998 and 2002 (Mills et al. 2008). From the point of view of the receiving countries, Saraladevi et al. (2009, p. 62) note that in the United Kingdom, “each qualifying doctor costs £200,000–£250,000 and 5–6 years to train, so in economic terms, every doctor arriving in the United Kingdom is appropriating human capital at zero cost for the use of the UK health services and the effect is immediate rather than in 5 years’ time”. In addition to the waste of resources invested in education, the early literature on the brain drain supports the view that <span class='card-underline'>skilled migration has several negative effects on the source countries</span> (see, among others, Bhagwati and Hamada 1974; Kwok and Leland 1982). <span class='card-underline'>There are four main messages</span> delivered by the traditional literature: (i) the <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>brain drain deprives developing countries of one of their scarcest resources</span></span>, i.e. human capital; (ii) <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>skilled migrants are net fiscal contributors and their departure represents a fiscal loss</span></span> for their home countries; (iii) <span class='card-underline'>human capital is a source of economic growth and</span> the brain drain negatively affects the countries’ economic performance and growth prospect; and (iv) the <span class='card-underline'>decrease in human capital seriously affects the countries capacity for innovation and the adoption of modern technologies and increases inequality</span> at the international level, <span class='card-underline'>with rich countries becoming richer at the expense of the poor countries</span>. More recent literature mitigates the above pessimistic view by putting forward several potential compensatory effects of the brain drain. The channels through which these effects may take place are different. For example, return migration can be a beneficial route if returning migrants use the additional knowledge acquired abroad to start up new entrepreneurial activities and contribute to the diffusion of new technology (Stark et al. 1997; Gubert and Nordman 2008; Wahba and Zenou 2009). Other scholars argue that highly skilled migrants promote bilateral trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) between countries of origin and destination through the creation of business networks (see Harris and Schmitt 2003 for a survey and Blanes 2005 for a case study focusing on Spain). Furthermore, Wahba and Zenou (2009) found that Egyptian return migrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs than non-migrants. Gubert and Nordman (2008) reached similar conclusions for return migrants to the Maghreb. Moreover, remittances can help poverty reduction. Studies conducted focusing on African countries show that remittances can favor the development of the source country (Adams et al. 2009). Other studies have documented a beneficial effect of remittances on education and poverty reduction (see, for example, Sasin 2008; Herrera et al. 2008; Roushdy et al. 2009). However, Faini (2007) argues that as skilled migrants come, in general, from wealthy families,9 their propensity to remit is relatively lower. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Consequently, the negative impact of the brain drain on source countries might not be mitigated by the favorable effect of remittances</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>.</span> Another important strand of literature, which Faini<span class='card-underline'> </span>(2003) labeled the “revisionist” approach to the analysis of the brain drain, has put forward the concept of brain gain as a potential beneficial effect of highly skilled migration. For example, Mountford (1997); Stark et al. (1997); Vidal (1998); Beine and Docquier (2001) and Beine et al. (2001) argue that if returns to education are higher abroad than at home, the prospects of migration might increase the expected return of human capital, thereby stimulating human capital formation among residents in source countries. As long as only a fraction of the increased highly skilled labor force end up migrating (due to migration uncertainty), the source country’s long-run stock of human capital might be higher than it would have been without migration opportunities. When the incentive effect described above (the brain gain) dominates the observed brain drain effect, we can talk about a net brain gain for the source country. Beine et al. (2008) found that <span class='card-underline'>there are countries which benefit from the brain drain, “the winners”,</span> in the authors’ terminology, <span class='card-underline'>and countries which experience a net loss of human capital, “the losers”</span>. However, the latter are a larger number than the former and their losses are higher than the gains of the winners. <span class='card-underline'>Net gains are obtained in large countries which combine low levels of human capital and low high-skilled emigration rates, while among the losers there are many small African countries characterized by low per capita income</span> (strong financial constraints to education) <span class='card-underline'>and high rates of skilled migration</span>. Other studies focusing on the impact of migration of health personnel found that the <span class='card-underline'>medical brain drain has a detrimental effect on public health, measured as the rate of adult death and infant child mortality</span> (for example, Bhargava et al. 2011). The evidence for the possible existence of a medical brain gain is mixed. Chojnicki and Oden-Defoort (2010) found that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>there might be a brain gain for most African countries, given the positive impact of the medical brain drain on the number of graduates from medical schools</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>.</span> <span class='card-underline'>However</span>, Bhargava et al. (2011) argue that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the effect is likely to be too small to compensate for the losses caused by the migration of highly skilled medical professionals</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>. I</span>t would then be important, from the policy perspective, that those African countries which are hit the hardest by the medical brain drain phenomenon try and implement policies that mitigate the bad economic conditions for physicians, which represent the main causes of their emigration (see Clemens and Pettersson 2006). We should keep in mind that the conclusion emerging from these empirical studies should be interpreted with caution, as their results may differ according to the methodology and data use. For example, Beine et al. (2001) found a positive net gain for developing countries as a whole (+2.2 per cent of tertiary graduates), however Docquier et al.’s (2008) conclusion is more pessimistic: <span class='card-underline'>the number of “winners” is very limited and, more significantly, the brain drain has a negative effect on the total number of the tertiary educated in developing countries </span>(–2.7 per cent tertiary graduates).</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Distrust claims of brain gain—our methodology is the least suspect and the most comparative</div><div class='cite'>Capuano and Marfouk 13—Stella Capuano, empirical economist at the Institute for Employment Studies, she has conducted large-scale macro data collection on international migration in OECD countries, PhD in economics from the University of Turin, and Abdeslam Marfouk, Center for Ethnic and Migration Studies, (CEDEM), University of Liege and IWEPS, 2013 (“African Brain Drain and Its Impact on Source Countries: What Do We Know and What Do We Need to Know?” Journal of Comparative Policy Analysis, Vol. 15, No. 4, 2013, p. 297-314, Available Online at https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13876988.2013.813122, Accessed 07-16-2018)//hk</div><div class='card-body'><p>It is worth noticing that the <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>theoretical and applied works on the brain gain may suffer from different shortcomings</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>. </span><span class='card-highlight'>First of all</span><span class='card-highlight'>, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>there is a fundamental argumentation flaw: brain gain research tends to refer always to developing countries, highlighting how the brain drain may raise the stock of human capital in the source countries.

The best illustration can be found in the Third European Report on Science and Technology in which the European Commission (2003, p. 225) emphasizes: It is common to present the emigration of European students and researchers as a threat to Europe’s competitiveness in scientific fields and applied research. The exodus of highly qualified scientists and engineers, often described as “brain drain”, may weaken the field of research in Europe, while strengthening the continent’s main competitor, the US. In same report, the European Commission (2003, p. 222) points out: The loss of human resources to the US may put a strain on national education systems and place EU employers in a position where there is severe competition with their US counterparts for S&T personnel. A more serious consequence could be that the drain of EU based talent and skills leads to a further relative strengthening and growth of knowledge-intensive industries in the US. <span class='card-underline'>If the brain gain is a general theory, it should lead to the same conclusions regardless the countries of origin to which it applies</span>. More importantly, we should also take into consideration that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the analysis of brain gain may suffer from different shortcomings</span></span>. First of all, <span class='card-underline'>the emigration rate should, ideally, be calculated as a ratio of the emigrant to the origin countries’ native population. However, because</span> the <span class='card-underline'>datasets</span> the authors use <span class='card-underline'>do not contain information on the structure of immigration in the origin country by educational level, the computation of the emigration rate is based on total resident population</span> (natives + immigrants) <span class='card-underline'>instead</span> of native population. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>As a consequence</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>, the magnitude of the brain drain might be underestimated</span></span>, to a large extent, <span class='card-underline'>for countries where immigrants represent a significant proportion of the resident population</span>.10 </p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>The 10-year plan is doomed – Africa doesn’t have the technical skills to carry it out – brain drain is at critically low levels </div><div class='cite'>Kigotho, 2/9 – Reporter for the University World News (Wachira, “African Union devises 10-year plan to stem brain drain,” University World News, 2018, http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20180209080048133)//vp</div><div class='card-body'><p><span class='card-underline'>The issue is that the African Union is worried that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the continent’s lagging behind in availability of </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>critical technical skills and specialists</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> is almost an emergency</span></span>. <span class='card-underline'>According to the African Union’s position paper</span>, African Critical Technical Skills: <span class='card-underline'>Key capacity dimensions needed for the first 10 years of Agenda 2063</span>, produced by the African Capacity Building Foundation, the single biggest challenge to ownership of Africa’s development agenda <span class='card-underline'>is grounded in </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>severe shortages of experts with critical technical skills</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> Even then <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>there are no indicators that most countries are harnessing their human capital stock</span></span>. <span class='card-underline'>According to the paper, current higher education in Africa is heavily focused on non-critical technical skills areas. “</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>If this pattern continues, the continent is likely to continue having more non-critical technical skills graduates between 2020 and 2030,</span></span><span class='card-underline'>”</span> says the position paper.

We don’t want lotteries where the wrong people are in the lotteries.”</span><span class='card-underline'> </span>“And guess what<span class='card-underline'>? Who are the suckers that get those people?” he added, seemingly referring to the U.S.</span> Trump called Saipov an “animal” and said he would consider sending him to Guantanamo Bay, a detention facility where alleged perpetrators of the 9/11 terrorist attacks have remained on trial for years. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Restrictionists</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> have for years targeted the lottery, which provides legal pathways for people from countries with historically low immigration rates to the U.S., making it an ideal target for Trump</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> Established in 1990, the lottery provides only 50,000 visas annually, and applicants are required to have completed at least a high school education or at least two years of work experience.

Trump laid out the requests after eliminating a program that protects young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children and saying he would sign a bill to let them stay in the country only if he was granted other policy concessions.</span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Trump has called for slashing legal immigration by moving to a “merit-based” system that would allow fewer people to come to the U.S. based on family ties or through the visa lottery</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> He did so again on Wednesday. Trump called the lottery program a “Chuck Schumer beauty,” piggybacking off of other right-wing attacks on the Democratic senator from New York, who was one of the people to introduce the bill. He also sponsored the larger immigration bill that ultimately passed. Schumer shot back Wednesday, saying in a statement that Trump “should be focusing on the real solution ― anti-terrorism funding ― which he proposed cutting in his most recent budget.” Schumer helped push for the creation of the diversity visa lottery, but he also co-authored a bill that would have ended it. In 2013, he was part of the so-called Gang of Eight who drafted a bill that would have granted a path to citizenship to many undocumented immigrants, dramatically ramped up border security efforts and overhauled legal immigration. The bill passed the Senate but never got a vote in the House. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), another member of the Gang of Eight, came to Schumer’s defense on Wednesday by pointing out that the 2013 bill “did away with the Diversity Visa Program as part of broader reforms.” “I know, I was there,” Flake tweeted. Trump likely tagged “Fox & Friends” in one of his tweets because Sebastian Gorka, a former assistant to the president, appeared on the show Wednesday morning to discuss the visa program and advocate for its revision. “The idea that we’re just going to ― if you got a high school diploma and two years of work experience, we can roll the dice and can you come into America and it’s not based upon whether or not you are [a] strength [to] the nation ― that has to end,” Gorka said. He mentioned countries like Australia and New Zealand, which he claimed have “incredibly stringent immigration requirements” based on education. “No more political correctness,” he continued. “Political correctness can kill people.” Advocates of lower immigration levels frequently cite Australia’s merit-based system, but the country actually accepts far more immigrants as a percentage of its population than the U.S. does. Although Senate Democrats agreed to eliminate the diversity visa lottery program as part of the 2013 comprehensive immigration reform bill, there is no consensus within the party. In 2013, the Congressional Black Caucus expressed concern about plans to do away with the visas, about half of which go to people from African nations. The Uzbek population in the U.S. is relatively small, and a majority of new immigrants from the country came on diversity visas. Sixty-nine percent of Uzbek immigrants in 2010 were granted visas through the lottery, and only 2 percent came as refugees, according to analysis of government data by the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. Tuesday afternoon, in the hours after the attack, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Trump tweeted that it “looks like another attack by a very sick and deranged person.”</span></span> He then appeared to suggest the event may be linked to the militant group that calls itself the Islamic State, which has not yet been found to have any connection to the attack. At least eight people were killed and 12 were injured after a man drove a Home Depot rental truck down a bike path on the West Side Highway, striking several people. The driver also rammed the truck into a school bus. Saipov, who was injured in the attack, was later taken into police custody.

The terrorist, a native of Uzbekistan, came to the United States in 2010 through the Diversity Visa Program (program) according to press reports. Uzbekistan is a large, majority-Muslim country located north of Afghanistan.¶ The next day, President Donald Trump said he wants congress to terminate the program.¶ <span class='card-underline'>Trump is not the first to want to end this program, and it is not just a partisan desire. The bipartisan Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, S.744, that the Senate passed in 2013 would have ended the program if it had not been rejected on other grounds in the House</span>.¶ <span class='card-underline'>S.744 was introduced by “the Gang of 8,”</span> which included Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.); Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), author of the original DREAM Act; and Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.¶ What is the Diversity Visa Program?¶ Section 201(e) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) provides 55,000 visas a year for a class of immigrants known as “diversity immigrants,” from countries with historically low rates of immigration to the United States.¶ ‘The number temporarily has been reduced to 50,000, to make up to 5,000 visas a year available for use by Nicaraguans who are eligible for the NACARA program.¶ The eligibility requirements are stated in section 203(c). The applicant must have been born in a designated country. There are exceptions based on other connections to the designated country. Also, he must have at least a high school education or its equivalent, or two years of work experience that required at least two years of training or experience to perform.¶ Reasons for terminating it.¶ <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>While it may be difficult to justify terminating the program on account of the recent terrorist attack, there should be some benefit to offset the fact that the program could bring terrorists to the United States</span></span>. If the New York City terrorist hadn’t been here, he wouldn’t have been able to commit a terrorist act here.¶ <span class='card-underline'>The claimed benefit is diversity, but does the program really make America more diverse?</span> The United States has a population of 326,199,506 people, and that number is increasing by one international migrant (net) every 32 seconds. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>How does adding 50,000 aliens a year make the country more </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>diverse?</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>¶</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Nevertheless, the program is bringing a lot of people in an absolute sense. Since 1995, it has made visas available to roughly one million people who have no ties to the United States</span></span>. Is this fair to American citizens and legal permanent residents who get visa petitions approved to bring family members here and then have to wait years for visas to become available?¶ The Visa Bulletin for November announced that visas are available to the unmarried sons and daughters of citizens, and the spouses and children and unmarried sons and daughters of permanent residents, on the basis of visa petitions that were filed more than six years ago on or before January 22, 2011.¶ The required filing dates are November 15, 2015, for the spouses and children of permanent residents; November 15, 2010, for the unmarried sons and daughters of permanent residents; August 15, 2005, for the married sons and daughters of citizens; and May 22, 2004, for the brothers and sisters of citizens.¶ Relatives from some countries wait even longer.¶ <span class='card-underline'>The program always has had problems with fraud</span>. <span class='card-underline'>An applicant once submitted more than 2,000 entries in a single year. Winners have sold themselves for marriage to bring a stranger to the United States as a spouse. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>And government audits have exposed sophisticated fraud schemes. This has included extortion rackets, sham marriages, and the use of fake identification </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>documents</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span><span class='card-underline'>¶</span> Moreover, the Federal Trade Commission has warned lottery participants that scammers are using fraudulent schemes to take advantage of them.¶ <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Adequate background investigations can be difficult to conduct in many of the designated countries. </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>All of</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> the countries on Trump’s new travel ban list are on the list of eligible countries</span></span>. In fact, in 2015, approximately 10,500 citizens from six of those countries were selected for the program according to the State Department.¶ Lastly, the visas are allocated randomly on the basis of a lottery run by the Department of State.¶ “A lottery is a crazy way to run an immigration system,” according to Steve Yale-Loehr, an immigration law professor at Cornell. “No other country selects immigrants based on a lottery.”¶ Wouldn’t the program add as much diversity if the same number of aliens, from the same group of countries, were to be selected on a merit-based point system?¶ My prediction is that the program will be terminated to make the visas available to family and/or employment-based immigrants.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Reducing existential risks is the top priority in any coherent moral theory, not just Util </div><div class='cite'>Plummer, PhD, 15</div><div class='card-body'><p>(Theron, Philosophy @St. Andrews http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2015/05/moral-agreement-on-saving-the-world/)</p><p>There appears to be lot of disagreement in moral philosophy.

This is for the familiar reason that there are so many people who could exist in the future – there are trillions upon trillions… upon trillions. <span class='card-underline'>There are so many possible future people that reducing existential risk is arguably the most important thing in the world</span>, even if the well-being of these possible people were given only 0.001% as much weight as that of existing people. <span class='card-underline'>Even on a wholly person-affecting view</span> – according to which there’s nothing (apart from effects on existing people) to be said in favor of creating happy people – <span class='card-underline'>the case for reducing existential risk is very strong</span>. As noted in this seminal paper, this case is strengthened by the fact that there’s a good chance that many existing people will, with the aid of life-extension technology, live very long and very high quality lives. <span class='card-underline'>You might think what I have just argued applies to consequentialists only.</span> <span class='card-underline'>There is a tendency to assume that, if an argument appeals to consequentialist considerations</span> (the goodness of outcomes), <span class='card-underline'>it is irrelevant to non-consequentialists</span>. <span class='card-underline'>But that is a huge mistake</span>. <span class='card-underline'>Non-consequentialism is the view that there’s more that determines rightness</span> <span class='card-underline'>than</span> the goodness of <span class='card-underline'>consequences </span>or outcomes; <span class='card-underline'>it is not the view that the latter don’t matter</span>. <span class='card-underline'>Even </span>John <span class='card-underline'>Rawls wrote, “</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>All ethical doctrines worth our attention take consequences into account</span></span> in judging rightness. <span class='card-underline'>One which did not would simply be irrational</span>, crazy.” <span class='card-underline'>Minimally plausible versions of deontology and virtue ethics must be concerned in part with promoting the good, from an impartial point of view</span>. <span class='card-underline'>They’d thus imply </span><span class='card-underline'>very strong reasons</span><span class='card-underline'> to reduce existential risk</span>, at least when this doesn’t significantly involve doing harm to others or damaging one’s character. What’s even more surprising, perhaps, is that even if our own good (or that of those near and dear to us) has much greater weight than goodness from the impartial “point of view of the universe,” indeed even if the latter is entirely morally irrelevant, we may nonetheless have very strong reasons to reduce existential risk. <span class='card-underline'>Even egoism</span>, the view that each agent should maximize her own good, <span class='card-underline'>might imply strong reasons to reduce existential risk. </span>It will depend, among other things, on what one’s own good consists in. If well-being consisted in pleasure only, it is somewhat harder to argue that egoism would imply strong reasons to reduce existential risk – perhaps we could argue that one would maximize her expected hedonic well-being by funding life extension technology or by having herself cryogenically frozen at the time of her bodily death as well as giving money to reduce existential risk (so that there is a world for her to live in!). I am not sure, however, how strong the reasons to do this would be. But views which imply that, if I don’t care about other people, I have no or very little reason to help them are not even minimally plausible views (in addition to hedonistic egoism, I here have in mind views that imply that one has no reason to perform an act unless one actually desires to do that act). To be minimally plausible, egoism will need to be paired with a more sophisticated account of well-being. To see this, it is enough to consider, as Plato did, the possibility of a ring of invisibility – suppose that, while wearing it, Ayn could derive some pleasure by helping the poor, but instead could derive just a bit more by severely harming them. Hedonistic egoism would absurdly imply she should do the latter. To avoid this implication, egoists would need to build something like the meaningfulness of a life into well-being, in some robust way, where this would to a significant extent be a function of other-regarding concerns (see chapter 12 of this classic intro to ethics). But once these elements are included, we can (roughly, as above) argue that this sort of egoism will imply strong reasons to reduce existential risk. Add to all of this Samuel Scheffler’s recent intriguing arguments (quick podcast version available here) that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>most of what makes our lives go well would be undermined if there were no future generations</span></span> of intelligent persons. On his view, my life would contain vastly less well-being if (say) a year after my death the world came to an end. <span class='card-underline'>So obviously</span> if Scheffler were right <span class='card-underline'>I’d have very strong reason to reduce existential risk</span>. <span class='card-underline'>We should also </span><span class='card-underline'>take into account</span><span class='card-underline'> moral uncertainty.</span> W<span class='card-underline'>hat is it reasonable for one to do, when one is uncertain</span> not (only<span class='card-underline'>) about</span> the empirical facts, but also about the <span class='card-underline'>moral facts?</span> I’ve just argued that there’s agreement among minimally plausible ethical views that we have strong reason to reduce existential risk – not only consequentialists, but also deontologists, virtue ethicists, and sophisticated egoists should agree. But even <span class='card-underline'>those </span>(hedonistic egoists) <span class='card-underline'>who disagree should have a significant level of confidence that they are mistaken,</span> and that one of the above views is correct. <span class='card-underline'>Even if they were 90% sure that their view is the correct one</span> (and 10% sure that one of these other ones is correct), <span class='card-underline'>they would have </span><span class='card-underline'>pretty </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>strong</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> reason, from the standpoint of moral uncertainty, to reduce existential risk</span></span>. Perhaps most disturbingly still, <span class='card-underline'>even if we are only 1% sure that the well-being of possible future people matters</span>, it is at least arguable that, from the standpoint of moral uncertainty, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>reducing existential risk is the most important thing in the world</span></span>. Again, this is largely <span class='card-underline'>for the reason that</span><span class='card-underline'> there are so many people who could exist in the future –</span> there are trillions upon trillions… upon trillions. (For more on this and other related issues, see this excellent dissertation<span class='card-underline'>). Of course, it is uncertain whether these untold trillions would, in general, have good lives</span>. It’s possible they’ll be miserable<span class='card-underline'>. It is enough</span> for my claim <span class='card-underline'>that there is moral agreement in the relevant sense if, at least given certain empirical claims about what future lives would most likely be like, all minimally plausible moral views would converge on the conclusion that we should try to save the world</span>. While there are some non-crazy views that place significantly greater moral weight on avoiding suffering than on promoting happiness, for reasons others have offered (and for independent reasons I won’t get into here unless requested to), they nonetheless seem to be fairly implausible views. And <span class='card-underline'>even if things did not go well for our ancestors, I am optimistic that they will overall go fantastically well for our descendants, if we allow them to</span>. I suspect that <span class='card-underline'>most of us alive today</span> – at least those of us not suffering from extreme illness or poverty – <span class='card-underline'>have lives that are well worth living, and that things will continue to improve</span>. Derek Parfit, whose work has emphasized future generations as well as agreement in ethics, described our situation clearly and accurately: “We live during the hinge of history. Given the scientific and technological discoveries of the last two centuries, the world has never changed as fast. We shall soon have even greater powers to transform, not only our surroundings, but ourselves and our successors. If we act wisely in the next few centuries, humanity will survive its most dangerous and decisive period. Our descendants could, if necessary, go elsewhere, spreading through this galaxy…. Our descendants might, I believe, make the further future very good. But that good future may also depend in part on us. If our selfish recklessness ends human history, we would be acting very wrongly.” (From chapter 36 of On What Matters)</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Predictions are possible and useful</div><div class='cite'>Mearsheimer, 01  (John, professor of political science at the University of Chicago, <span class='card-underline'>The Tragedy of Great Power Politic</span>s, 2001  p. 8, googleprint)</div><div class='card-body'><p>As a result, <span class='card-underline'>all political forecasting is bound to include some error</span>.

Rudy professor of Political Science and director of the Center for the Study of Democracy and Public Life at Indiana University, Bloomington, “Ends, Means and politics,” Dissent, Spring) – <^.^></p><p>As writers such as Niccolo Machiavelli, Max Weber, Reinhold Niebuhr, and Hannah Arendt have taught, an unyielding concern with moral goodness undercuts political responsibility. The concern may be morally laudable, reflecting a kind of personal integrity, but it suffers from three fatal flaws: (1) It fails to see that the purity of one’s intention does not ensure the achievement of what one intends. Abjuring violence or refusing to make common cause with morally compromised parties may seem like the right thing; but if such tactics entail impotence, then it is hard to view them as serving any moral good beyond the clean conscience of their supporters; (2) it fails to see that in a world of real violence and injustice, moral purity is not simply a form of powerlessness; it is often a form of complicity in injustice. This is why, from the standpoint of politics— as opposed to religion—pacifism is always a potentially immoral stand. In categorically repudiating violence, it refuses in principle to oppose certain violent injustices with any effect; and (3) it fails to see that politics is as much about unintended consequences as it is about intentions; it is the effects of action, rather than the motives of action, that is most significant. Just as the alignment with “good” may engender impotence, it is often the pursuit of “good” that generates evil. This is the lesson of communism in the twentieth century: it is not enough that one’s goals be sincere or idealistic; it is equally important, always, to ask about the effects of pursuing these goals and to judge these effects in pragmatic and historically contextualized ways. Moral absolutism inhibits this judgment. It alienates those who are not true believers. It promotes arrogance. And it undermines political effectiveness. </p><p>Utilitarianism is the only moral framework and any alternative is contradictory to nuclear age</p><p>Nye, 86 (Joseph S. 1986; Phd Political Science Harvard.

When you object to the killing of possibly innocent people, you are told that civil wars do not permit moral niceties. Just to prove the point that we all have dirty hands in such situations, the captain hands you a rifle and tells you that if you will shoot one peasant, he will free the other. Otherwise both die. He warns you not to try any tricks because his men have their guns trained on you<span class='card-highlight'>. </span><span class='card-highlight'>Will you shoot one person with the consequences of saving one, or will you allow both to die but preserve your moral integrity by refusing to play his dirty game?</span> The point of the story is to show the value and limits of both traditions<span class='card-highlight'>. Integrity is clearly an important value, and many of us would refuse to shoot. But at what point does the principle of not taking an innocent life collapse before the consequentialist burden</span><span class='card-highlight'>?</span> Would it matter if there were twenty or 1,000 peasants to be saved? <span class='card-highlight'>What if killing or torturing one innocent person could save a city of 10 million persons from a terrorists' nuclear device?</span> At some point does not integrity become the ultimate egoism of fastidious self-righteousness in which the purity of the self is more important than the lives of countless others? <span class='card-highlight'>Is it</span> not <span class='card-highlight'>better to follow a consequentialist approach, admit remorse or regret over the immoral means, but</span> <span class='card-highlight'>justify the action by the consequences</span>? Do absolutist approaches to integrity become self-contradictory in a world of nuclear weapons? "Do what is right though the world should perish" was a difficult principle even when Kant expounded it in the eighteenth century, and there is some evidence that he did not mean it to be taken literally even then. Now that it may be literally possible in the nuclear age, it seems more than ever to be self-contradictory.35 <span class='card-highlight'>Absolutist ethics bear a heavier burden of proof in the nuclear age than ever before</span>.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Our impact comes first---only impact you can’t recover from</div><div class='cite'>Bauman 95 [Zygmunt, University of Leeds Professor Emeritus of Sociology, 1995, Life In Fragments: Essays In Postmodern Morality, p. 66-71]</div><div class='card-body'><p>The <span class='card-highlight'>being</span><span class='card-highlight'>‑</span>for is like <span class='card-highlight'>living towards</span><span class='card-highlight'>‑</span>the<span class='card-highlight'>‑</span>future: a being filled with anticipation, a being aware of the abyss between future foretold and future that will eventually be; it is this gap which, like a magnet, draws the self towards the Other,as it draws life towards the future, making life into an activity of overcoming, transcending, leaving behind. The self stretches towards the Other, as life stretches towards the future; neither can grasp what it stretches toward, but <span class='card-highlight'>it is in this hopeful and desperate, never conclusive and never abandoned stretching</span><span class='card-highlight'>‑</span>toward that the self is ever anew created and life ever anew lived. In the words of M. M. Bakhtin, it is only in this not‑yet accomplished world of anticipation and trial, leaning toward stubbornly an‑other Other, that life can be lived ‑ not in the world of the `events that occurred'; in the latter world, `it is impossible to live, to act responsibly; in it, I am not needed, in principle I am not there at all." Art, the Other, the future: what unites them, what makes them into three words vainly trying to grasp the same mystery, is the modality of possibility. A curious modality, at home neither in ontology nor epistemology; itself, like that which it tries to catch in its net, `always outside', forever `otherwise than being'. The possibility we are talking about here is not the all‑too‑familiar unsure‑of‑itself, and through that uncertainty flawed, inferior and incomplete being, disdainfully dismissed by triumphant existence as `mere possibility', `just a possibility'; possibility is instead `plus que la reahte' ‑ both the origin and the foundation of being. The hope, says Blanchot, proclaims the possibility of that which evades the possible; `in its limit, this is the hope of the bond recaptured where it is now lost."' The hope is always the hope of being fu filled, but what keeps the hope alive and so keeps the being open and on the move is precisely its unfu filment. One may say that the paradox of hope (and the paradox of possibility founded in hope) is that it may pursue its destination solely through betraying its nature; the most exuberant of energies expends itself in the urge towards rest. Possibility uses up its openness in search of closure. Its image of the better being is its own impoverishment . . . The togetherness of the being‑for is cut out of the same block; it shares in the paradoxical lot of all possibility. It lasts as long as it is unfulfilled, yet it uses itself up in never ending effort of fulfilment, of recapturing the bond, making it tight and immune to all future temptations. In an important, perhaps decisive sense, it is selfdestructive and self‑defeating: its triumph is its death. The Other, like restless and unpredictable art, like the future itself, is a mystery. And being‑for‑the‑Other, going towards the Other through the twisted and rocky gorge of affection, brings that mystery into view ‑ makes it into a challenge. That mystery is what has triggered the sentiment in the first place ‑ but cracking that mystery is what the resulting movement is about. The mystery must be unpacked so that the being‑for may focus on the Other: one needs to know what to focus on. (The `demand' is unspoken, the responsibility undertaken is unconditional; it is up to him or her who follows the demand and takes up the responsibility to decide what the following of that demand and carrying out of that responsibility means in practical terms.) Mystery ‑ noted Max Frisch ‑ (and the Other is a mystery), is an exciting puzzle, but one tends to get tired of that excitement. `And so one creates for oneself an image. This is a loveless act, the betrayal." Creating an image of the Other leads to the substitution of the image for the Other; the Other is now fixed ‑ soothingly and comfortingly. There is nothing to be excited about anymore. I know what the Other needs, I know where my responsibility starts and ends. Whatever the Other may now do will be taken down and used against him. What used to be received as an exciting surprise now looks more like perversion; what used to be adored as exhilarating creativity now feels like wicked levity. Thanatos has taken over from Eros, and the excitement of the ungraspable turned into the dullness and tedium of the grasped. But, as Gyorgy Lukacs observed, `everything one person may know about another is only expectation, only potentiality, only wish or fear, acquiring reality only as a result of what happens later, and this reality, too, dissolves straightaway into potentialities'. <span class='card-highlight'>Only death, with its finality and irreversibility, puts an end to</span> the musical‑chairs game of <span class='card-highlight'>the real and the potential</span> ‑ it once and for all closes the embrace of togetherness which was before invitingly open and tempted the lonely self." `Creating an image' is the dress rehearsal of that death. But creating an image is the inner urge, the constant temptation, the must of all affection . . . It is the loneliness of being abandoned to an unresolvable ambivalence and an unanchored and formless sentiment which sets in motion the togetherness of being‑for. But what loneliness seeks in togetherness is an end to its present condition ‑ an end to itself. Without knowing ‑ without being capable of knowing ‑ that the hope to replace the vexing loneliness with togetherness is founded solely on its own unfulfilment, and that once loneliness is no more, the togetherness ( the being‑for togetherness) must also collapse, as it cannot survive its own completion. What the loneliness seeks in togetherness (suicidally for its own cravings) is the foreclosing and pre‑empting of the future, cancelling the future before it comes, robbing it of mystery but also of the possibility with which it is pregnant. Unknowingly yet necessarily, it seeks it all to its own detriment, since the success (if there is a success) may only bring it back to where it started and to the condition which prompted it to start on the journey in the first place. The togetherness of being‑for is always in the future, and nowhere else. It is no more once the self proclaims: `I have arrived', `I have done it', `I fulfilled my duty.' The being‑for starts from the realization of the bottomlessness of the task, and ends with the declaration that the infinity has been exhausted. This is the tragedy of being‑for ‑ the reason why it cannot but be death‑bound while simultaneously remaining an undying attraction. In this tragedy, there are many happy moments, but no happy end. <span class='card-highlight'>Death is always the foreclosure of possibilities</span>, and it comes eventually in its own time, even if not brought forward by the impatience of love. The catch is to direct the affection to staving off the end, and to do this against the affection's nature. What follows is that, if moral relationship is grounded in the being-for togetherness (as it is), then it can exist as a project, and guide the self's conduct only as long as its nature of a project (a not yet-completed project) is not denied. Morality, like the future itself, is forever not‑yet. (And this is why the ethical code, any ethical code, the more so the more perfect it is by its own standards, supports morality the way the rope supports the hanged man.) It is because of our loneliness that we crave togetherness. It is because of our loneliness that we open up to the Other and allow the Other to open up to us. It is because of our loneliness (which is only belied, not overcome, by the hubbub of the being‑with) that we turn into moral selves. And <span class='card-highlight'>it is only through allowing the togetherness its possibilities which only the future can disclose that we stand a chance of acting morally</span>, and sometimes even of being good, <span class='card-highlight'>in the present</span>.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'><span class='card-underline'>Escaping to the U.S. will land the women in more abusive situations </span></div><div class='cite'><span class='card-underline'>YWCA 2017</span></div><div class='card-body'><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Newly - arrived immigrant survivors may face</span></span><span class='card-underline'> additional forms of </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>abuse that women</span></span><span class='card-underline'> of color and Native women born </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>in</span></span><span class='card-underline'> the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>U</span></span><span class='card-underline'>nited </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>S</span></span><span class='card-underline'>tates </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>may not, including</span></span><span class='card-underline'>:  </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>threats of deportation</span></span><span class='card-underline'> despite immigration status, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>possible language barriers, lack of knowledge of the</span></span><span class='card-underline'> American </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>legal system</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>threatening to report employment status if survivor works "under the table"</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>threatening to deport her and keeping the children</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, withdrawal of petition to complete legalization status, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>intimidation by destroying</span></span> important documents such as an <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>identification card or passport</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.

The Trump administration is trying to get that order overturned, so that it doesn’t have to renew anyone’s work permits while the case over the constitutionality of ending DACA works its way through the courts. By rejecting the administration’s request, the Supreme Court isn’t saying anything about the merits of the DACA program itself, or about the legal arguments over the Trump administration’s decision to end it. It’s just insisting that the case proceed the normal way, with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals hearing the administration’s appeal of the California judge’s order (and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals on the East Coast hearing an appeal of a similar order issued in February by a New York judge).

Here's a look at what the ruling means for everyone involved. President Trump started the controversy in September when he announced he would end the Obama-era program, which was protecting nearly 700,000 undocumented immigrants from deportation. He set the official termination date as March 5, giving Congress six months to find a legislative solution. That left DREAMers in a state of panic, because they would be exposed to deportation if they lost their DACA protections, and would lose the work permits that came with DACA. Employers were starting to prepare to lay off DACA enrollees. And many participants in the program were unsure whether they would be able to remain in colleges and universities, or continue receiving grants and loans that helped them afford those schools. Now, those <span class='card-underline'>DREAMers</span><span class='card-underline'> can rest a little easier knowing that they will remain protected and can continue renewing their DACA protections as the case moves back to lower courts</span>. Andrew Pincus, a Supreme Court litigator at the Mayer Brown law firm, said appeals courts would likely rule on several DACA-related lawsuits sometime over the summer. That means<span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the issue would not come back before the Supreme Court until its next term</span></span>, which begins in October.</p><p> </p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'><span class='card-highlight'>Dems to win the midterms – which would help save DACA.</span></div><div class='cite'><span class='card-highlight'>Savage ’18</span> David G.

A district judge in New York this month issued a similar ruling. <span class='card-underline'>In seeking to get </span><span class='card-underline'>Alsup's</span><span class='card-underline'> order overturned, the Justice Department sought to leapfrog the U.S. appeals court</span> in California, asking the Supreme Court to grant an "immediate review" of Alsup's nationwide order.

"It is assumed that the Court of Appeals will proceed expeditiously to decide this case," the justices noted in a brief order. <span class='card-underline'>Even though the action by the high court was procedural</span> in nature, not a ruling on the substance of the case, <span class='card-underline'>it has significant impact </span><span class='card-underline'>because it keeps in place </span><span class='card-underline'>Alsup's</span><span class='card-underline'> injunction</span> <span class='card-underline'>for as long as the case wends its way through the judicial system</span>, <span class='card-underline'>which could be quite a while. </span>In their appeal to the high court, administration lawyers said the <span class='card-underline'>injunction would likely last well into 2019 if the appeals run their normal course in the lower courts.

This data, the Implied Relative Risk Aversion (IRRA) can be factored into an economic forecast. An option is a contract that gives the buyer the right to buy or sell an underlying security at a specified price on a specified date. Using the OptionMetrics Ivy DB databases (academia’s definitive source of historical options pricing data) for the most liquid of stock index options contracts, those that trade based on the S&P 500 Index SPX, -0.07% we found Implied Relative Risk Aversion outperforms existing economic indicators once it is used in conjunction with them. A decrease in IRRA predicts an increase in economic growth because investors boost investments when they become less risk averse. Conversely, an increase in risk aversion points to a slowdown in growth because investors lower investments when they become more risk averse. Implied Relative Risk Aversion is currently quite low, at 3.6 for May, after readings of 3.7 in April and March, implying that traders in the S&P 500 options market anticipate an increase in U.S. economic growth. The last pop in IRRA occurred in December 2013, as seen in the accompanying graph (above), when IRRA hit 6.8. Shortly afterward, the U.S. economy contracted by 0.9% in the first quarter of 2014. Even more revealing, in the second half of 2007 IRRA rose sharply in anticipation of the recession’s beginning in December of that year. IRRA reached its historic peak of 9.3 in February 2008. Afterward, the depths of the Great Recession followed, with four consecutive quarters of negative gross domestic product (GDP). <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>In contrast to other economic predictors</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>IRRA manages to forecast the future state of the U.S. economy more accurately because it is constructed by index option market prices</span></span>. <span class='card-underline'>Option markets tend to attract more sophisticated investors than</span> other markets on which the <span class='card-underline'>standard</span> economic i<span class='card-underline'>ndicators </span>rely <span class='card-underline'>because they</span> offer leverage and they often <span class='card-underline'>enjoy smaller transaction costs.</span> As a result, index option prices reflect the expectations of informed investors first before other markets’ prices do, and hence they are more informative about the future state of the economy.

But to many of the country’s trading partners, the president’s criticisms ring hollow given that the United States places its own tariffs on everything from trucks and peanuts to sugar and stilettos. “While the system has problems, it is in no way ‘unfair,’ to the U.S., which as a hegemon has set the rules and the exceptions to the rules,” said Susan Aaronson, a professor at George Washington University’s Elliott School of International Affairs. The United States has long been the biggest champion of global trade, viewing the opening of borders as essential to strengthening not only its economy but the global economy as well. It led the way in building the international trading order in the 20th century, rising to become the world’s predominant economy. Tariffs were used as a way to offer protection for certain industries, but free trade was considered the tide that would lift all boats because all countries involved would benefit. Instead of viewing trade as a mutually beneficial relationship, the president has described trading relationships as a zero-sum game, in which the United States loses out when other countries have more favorable terms. Mr. Trump has seized on trade policy to prop up industries that he has promised to revitalize, such as manufacturing, by limiting foreign competition. Many of the United States’ tariffs were put in place to protect influential industries that lobbied the government to set high barriers to foreign products, including a 25 percent tariff on sugar and foreign trucks, and a 163 percent tariff on imported peanuts. Mr. Trump has singled out specific products where American producers face barriers, like Canada’s 270 percent tariff on imported milk and Europe’s 10 percent tariffs on American cars. On Saturday night, as Mr. Trump left the Group of 7 summit meeting en route to Singapore for a meeting with North Korea, he lashed out at Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada once again for his country’s dairy tariffs and for his criticisms of Mr. Trump’s trade measures. “Very dishonest & weak,” Mr. Trump wrote in a tweet aboard Air Force One. “Our Tariffs are in response to his of 270% on dairy!” But on average, American tariffs are on par with those of other rich, developed countries, which tend to be low, according to the World Bank and the United Nations. Among the developed nations that make up the Group of 7 that met in a resort town near Quebec City this weekend, the United States has tariffs that are slightly <span class='card-underline'>higher, on average, across all its imported products</span> than Canada or Japan and exactly equivalent to the four European nations in the G-7. So far this year, Mr. <span class='card-underline'>T</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>rump has imposed tariffs on nearly $60 billion of steel, aluminum, solar products and washing machines that flow into the United States </span></span><span class='card-underline'>from around the world. He is threatening additional tariffs on foreign goods that would expand his trade penalties significantly, including a tariff on $350 billion of imported automobiles and parts and levies on $150 billion worth of Chinese goods</span>, on the assumption those will force trading partners to drop their own barriers to entry. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The approach risks upending</span></span> the United States’ longstanding embrace of free <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>trade</span></span> and its use of trading relationships to help power economic growth in the United States <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>and the world economy writ large</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> Since the Second World War, the United States has cut its tariff rates in step with other developed countries. It also gave some less-developed countries access to its markets, with the idea of increasing wages and improving quality of life. Mr. Trump appears ready to change that equation and increasingly views every country as a threat, regardless of its economic strength. <span class='card-underline'>Critics fea</span>r Mr. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Trump’s approach will hurt</span></span> developing <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>nations and result in an escalating series of tariffs that raise costs</span></span> for American consumers and industries, potentially harming the very manufacturers Mr. Trump says his trade policy is intended to protect. “<span class='card-underline'>Trump’s bull in a china shop act is clearly grating on other trading partners</span>, who now see the U.S. as a recalcitrant and unruly member of the global trading system rather than as a responsible steward,” said Eswar Prasad, a professor of international trade at Cornell University.

The CBO estimates 2 million aliens eligible for conditional resident status would become naturalized citizens. <span class='card-underline'>That projection</span> – a low-ball figure in light of prior amnesties and DREAM Act provisions – <span class='card-underline'>minimizes the true fiscal impact.</span> If history is a reliable guide – and there’s no reason to think it isn’t —<span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>significantly more aliens are likely to apply. This would add billions to the DREAM Act’s initial price tag</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>.</span> Witness the amnesty embedded in the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. Some 2.7 million illegal aliens established legal residence through IRCA, significantly more than the government’s top estimates. Language in the DREAM Act ensures that more low-skill, low-education aliens will be waved through – granting them access to legal employment, as well as a full smorgasbord of public benefits (your $26.8 billion at work). <span class='card-underline'>The most expensive benefit would be Obamacare subsidies ($12 billion), earned income and child tax credits ($5.5 billion), Medicaid ($5 billion) and food stamps ($2 billion). CBO understates the impact here, too, by excluding state and local outlays. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>A “confidentiality” provision in the DREAM Act bars Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers from examining amnesty application files, raising the odds for fraud.</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span>Further, <span class='card-underline'>government adjudicators are required to accept easily doctored documents</span> – utility bills, rent receipts, even remittance records — <span class='card-underline'>as evidence of eligibility. </span>If all else fails, applications can be approved for “humanitarian purposes or family unity.” “It will be exceedingly difficult for the government to deny an applicant and not be sued for ‘abuse of discretion’ when those are the standards for grants of waivers to criminals, smugglers and illegal voters,” notes the Center for Immigration Studies. <span class='card-underline'>The</span> not-so-dreamy <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>DREAM Act gashes a broken immigration system while further straining American workers and taxpayers</span></span><span class='card-underline'>,</span> says Rep.

Although that performance amounts to less than the heady 4 percent annual growth that President Trump has promised, <span class='card-underline'>it is </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>further evidence</span></span><span class='card-underline'> — along with a sinking jobless rate and surging consumer confidence —</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>of the economy’s resilience</span></span>. “The year-end is solid,” said Joel Prakken, chief United States economist at Macroeconomic Advisers by IHS Markit. Details within the report, about <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>climbing business investment and depleted inventories, suggest more economic strength</span></span><span class='card-underline'> than the bare-bones headline number might indicate. “It portends well for 2018 demand</span>,” he said. In the year ahead, hefty tax cuts, particularly for businesses, are expected to encourage more investment and spending, although many economists predict ballooning deficits will overtake the positive effects in the longer term. One-time quirks that could affect growth measurements this year could also end up artificially pumping 2018’s figures. Even analysts with ambitious forecasts for the next year, however, agree that the United States is unlikely to sustain annual growth of much more than 2 percent given a smaller, aging work force; sluggish productivity growth; and soaring deficits. “<span class='card-underline'>The economy’s sustainable trend is around 2 percent,</span>” Mr. Prakken said. The Commerce Department’s report on the gross domestic product — which showed growth for all of last year at 2.3 percent — is a rough draft. The fourth-quarter estimate will be revised twice in the next couple of months, and it could increase or drop by as much as a percentage point, based on previous recalculations. After all, government statisticians have to put together the fourth-quarter estimate without complete data on construction, trade and inventories. Mr. Trump inherited an improving economy, and during his first year in office, the trend continued and growth accelerated. Supporters credit Mr. <span class='card-underline'>Trump</span> with <span class='card-underline'>revving up business and consumer </span><span class='card-underline'>confidence, and</span><span class='card-underline'> say</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> tax cuts and eased regulation are fueling capital investment and job creation.</span></span> They also point <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>to a booming stock market</span></span>, though market gains are not necessarily a gauge of economic underpinnings. The president ticked off those items on Friday when he hailed America’s economic strength at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, where global leaders have been sharing encouraging economic news all week. The American economy recovered from a plodding start in the first three months of 2017, when sharp cuts in consumer spending limited G.D.P. growth to 1.2 percent on an annualized basis. It sprang back over the next six months, with the rate reaching 3.1 percent in the second quarter and 3.2 percent in the third. In the fourth quarter, holiday shoppers were enthusiastic, and spending on business and residential housing was up. A persistent appetite for foreign goods continued to widen the trade deficit — it reached nearly $72 billion for goods alone in December — and dragged down gains. But inventory declines that detracted from G.D.P. last quarter should rebound over the next as businesses refill empty shelves. The American economy’s performance has also been buoyed by simultaneous growth in nations around the world, which has fueled trade and enabled foreign consumers to buy more American-made products.</p><p> </p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Growth is resilient---wage growth, massive investment, and tax cuts</div><div class='cite'>TCB 18 (The Conference Board, a global, independent business membership and research association working in the public interest, 2/14/18, “The Conference Board Economic Forecast for the U.S. Economy,” https://www.conference-board.org/data/usforecast.cfm)</div><div class='card-body'><p>Volatility has returned to the economy with a vengeance.

If we have to choose – and we do have to, he said – <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>modernization must take priority over growth</span></span> and warfighting must take priority all other missions.</p><p>“When Secretary Mattis came in, he was shocked when he said, ‘ok, what happens if Korea goes up?'” because he got deeply unsatisfactory answers about the readiness of the force, said Work, who was Jim Mattis’s deputy at the time.</p><p>“This was one of the greatest moments I had as the deputy secretary of defense,” Work told an audience at SAIS yesterday evening. “Sec. Mattis looked at all of the senior military officers in the department and said, ‘I want you to think and operate every day as though we’re at war next week….You need to be thinking that things can go south in an hurry and we’ll have to respond regardless of the state of our forces.”</p><p>Two Traps</p><p>As the White House, Congress, and the Pentagon struggle to restore the US military’s readiness for war, Work said, they must avoid two great traps. First, he said, <span class='card-underline'>we can’t let the insatiable demands of the theater combatant commanders</span> (COCOMs) <span class='card-underline'>siphon off forces from the vital task of deterring rival nation-states</span>, above all Russia and China. Second, he said, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>we can’t let</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> well-intentioned </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>enthusiasm to build a bigger force</span></span> – as President Trump and House Republicans have promised – <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>come at the expense of readiness and modernization</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> for the military we already have.</span></span></p><p>During the Cold War, Work said, US policymakers had clarity about the military’s missions. Deterring the Soviet Union by standing ready to fight it – primarily with conventional forces in Europe, but with nukes if necessary – was unambiguously number one. Readiness to respond to lesser crises such as Vietnam came second. “Shaping” operations to advance peace, stability, and democracy around the world came a distant third. In the years of US unipolar dominance after the fall of the Berlin Wall, however, those priorities reversed, until shaping become the dominant mission in both official doctrine and operational practice.</p><p>So even as Central Command waged two prolonged wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, <span class='card-underline'>CENTCOM and other COCOMs kept up an intense pace of operations to take out terrorists, train local partners, respond to disasters, and generally show the flag</span>. In fact, the way the Defense Department works, <span class='card-underline'>COCOM commanders could make unlimited demands without paying any of the cost, leaving it to Pentagon planners and the overstretched services to figure out how to meet them.</span></p><p><span class='card-underline'>The result, Work said, has been a terrible erosion of readiness to fight an actual war.</span></p><p>Modernization vs. COCOMs</p><p>The Japan-based 7th Fleet, for example, was waiving certifications on training to get ships out to sea for “presence” patrols, contributing to two deadly accidents. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Maintenance on submarines is badly backlogged, leaving few boats ready to respond in a crisis.</span></span></p><p>“<span class='card-underline'>Cut presence before cutting maintenance, for God’s sake</span>!” fumed Work, a retired Marine and former navy undersecretary. “<span class='card-underline'>The US Navy, the greatest navy on the planet, is in big trouble right now because it tried to chase all of the shaping requirements that were levied upon it, rather than just say no</span>.”</p><p>It’s worth noting that Trump’s relatively new Navy Secretary, Richard Spencer, has said publicly <span class='card-underline'>the Navy should start saying no to missions that come at the expense of readiness</span>. Defense Secretary Mattis has put readiness as priority No. 1 across the board. So there are signs this mindset is taking root in the Trump administration.</p><p>Work’s other key argument, however, may be less welcome in Washington. “<span class='card-underline'>Before substantially increasing the size of the joint force, I would argue, hone the force we have</span>,” he said. President Trump has promised a larger military, and while the president’s proposed budgets have been modest, <span class='card-underline'>House Republicans in particular have been </span><span class='card-underline'>keep</span><span class='card-underline'> to add more troops, ships, and planes</span>.

Whereas in early agricultural societies human violence caused up to 15% of all human deaths, and in the twentieth century it caused 5%, today it is responsible for only about 1%. Yet the international climate is rapidly deteriorating; warmongering is back in vogue, and military expenditure is ballooning<span class='card-underline'>. Both laypeople and experts fear that just as in 1914 the murder of an Austrian archduke sparked the First World War, in 2017 some incident in the Syrian Desert or an unwise move in the Korean Peninsula might ignite a global conflict</span>. Yet <span class='card-underline'>there are several key differences between 2017 and 1914. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Back then, war had great appeal to elites across the world because they had concrete examples for how successful wars contribute to economic success and political power</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>. Now, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>successful wars seem to be an endangered species.</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>From the days of Assyria and Rome, great empires were usually built through war, and elites in 1914 had plenty of recent examples for the huge profits a successful war can bring. In 1846–48 the United States invaded Mexico, and for the price of 13,000 dead American soldiers, it got California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico and parts of Colorado, Kansas, Wyoming and Oklahoma. It was the bargain of the millennium. Similarly, imperial Japan cherished its victories over China and Russia; Germany glorified its triumph over France; and almost every great power had a string of splendid little colonial wars to its name. When France, Britain or Italy contemplated putting boots on the ground in Vietnam, Nigeria or Libya, their main fear was that somebody else might get there first. <span class='card-underline'>In 2017, global elites don’t know what a successful war even looks like</span>. They may have read about them in history books and seen fanciful recreations in Hollywood blockbusters, but <span class='card-underline'>they have good reason to suspect that this type of war has gone extinct.</span> <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Though some</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> third-world </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>dictators</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> and non-state actors still manage to </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>flourish through war,</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> it seems that </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>major powers no longer know how to do so. </span></span><span class='card-underline'>The greatest victory in living memory — of the United States over the Soviet Union — was achieved without any major military confrontation</span>. The U.S. then got a fleeting taste of old-fashioned military glory in the First Gulf War — which only tempted it to waste trillions on humiliating military fiascos in Iraq and Afghanistan. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>China, the rising power of the early twenty-first century, has assiduously avoided all armed conflicts</span></span> since its Vietnamese debacle of 1979, and it owes its ascent strictly to economic factors. In this, it has emulated not the Japanese and German empires of the pre-1914 era, but rather the nonviolent Japanese and German economic miracles of the post-1945 era. <span class='card-underline'>Even in the Middle East, regional powers don’t know how to wage successful</span> <span class='card-underline'>wars</span>. <span class='card-underline'>Iran gained nothing from the long bloodbath of the Iran-Iraq War and subsequently avoided all direct military confrontations.</span> It became regional hegemon by default, as its two main enemies — the U.S. and Iraq — got embroiled in a war that destroyed both Iraq and the American appetite for Middle Eastern quagmires. Much the same can be said of Israel, which waged its last successful war fifty years ago. Since 1967, <span class='card-underline'>Israel has prospered despite its many wars, not thanks to them</span>. Its conquered territories are a heavy economic burden and a crippling political liability. Like Iran, Israel has recently improved its geopolitical position not by waging successful wars, but by avoiding getting sucked into the wars that devastated Iraq, Syria and Libya. <span class='card-underline'>The only recent successful war waged by a major power has been the Russian conquest of the Crimea. However, it was made possible by an extraordinary set of circumstances:</span> <span class='card-underline'>The Ukrainian army showed no resistance; other powers refrained from intervening; and the Crimean population either supported the invaders or peacefully accepted the conquest as a fait accompli</span>. These circumstances will be hard to reproduce. If the precondition for a successful war is the absence of any enemies willing to resist, it limits the available opportunities. <span class='card-underline'>Indeed, when Russia sought to reproduce its Crimean success in other parts of the Ukraine, it encountered substantially stiffer opposition, and the war in eastern Ukraine bogged down into an unproductive stalemate.</span> Conquering decrepit Soviet-era factories in Luhansk and Donetsk hardly pays for the war, and it certainly does not offset the costs of international sanctions. The conquest of Crimea notwithstanding, it seems that <span class='card-underline'>in the twenty-first century </span><span class='card-underline'>the most successful strategy is to keep your peace and let others do the fighting for you.</span><span class='card-underline'> Why has it become so difficult for major powers to wage successful wars? One reason is the change </span><span class='card-underline'>in the nature of the</span><span class='card-underline'> economy.</span> In the past, <span class='card-underline'>if you defeated your enemy on the battlefield, you could easily cash in by looting enemy cities, selling enemy civilians in the slave markets and occupying valuable wheat fields and gold mines. Yet in the twenty-first century, only puny profits could be made that way.</span> Today, <span class='card-underline'>the main economic assets consist of technical and institutional knowledge — and you cannot conquer knowledge through war.</span> An organization such as ISIS may flourish by looting cities and oil wells in the Middle East — in 2014, ISIS seized more than $500 million from Iraqi banks and in 2015 made an additional $500 million from selling oil. But <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>China and the U.S. are unlikely to start a war for a paltry billion.</span></span><span class='card-underline'> As for spending trillions of dollars on a war against the U.S., how could China repay these expenses and balance all the war damages and lost trade opportunities? Would the victorious People’s Liberation Army loot the riches of Silicon Valley?</span> True, corporations such as Apple, Facebook and Google are worth hundreds of billions of dollars, but you cannot seize these fortunes by force. There are no silicon mines in Silicon Valley.<span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>A successful war could theoretically still bring huge profits by enabling the victor to rearrange the global trade system in its favor</span></span>, as the U.S. did after its victory over Hitler. However<span class='card-underline'>, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>present-day military technology would make it extremely difficult to repeat this feat.</span></span> By definition, <span class='card-underline'>profits</span><span class='card-underline'> large enough to make a global war worthwhile for the victor will also make it worthwhile for the loser to resort to weapons of mass destruction.</span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The atom bomb has turned “victory” in a World War into collective suicide</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>. </span>It is no coincidence that since Hiroshima <span class='card-underline'>superpowers never fought one another </span><span class='card-underline'>directly, and</span><span class='card-underline'> engaged only in what</span> (for them) <span class='card-underline'>were low-stake conflicts in which none was tempted to use nuclear weapons to avert defeat</span>. Indeed, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>even attacking a second-rate nuclear power</span></span> such as Iran or North Korea <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is an extremely unattractive proposition.</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>Cyber warfare makes things even worse for would-be imperialists</span>. As recently as the days of George W. Bush, the U.S. could wreak havoc in far-off Fallujah while the Iraqis had no means of retaliating against San Francisco. But <span class='card-underline'>if the U.S. now attacks a country possessing even moderate cyber warfare capabilities, malware and logic bombs could stop air traffic in Dallas, cause trains to collide in Philadelphia and bring down the electric grid in Michigan</span>. In the great age of conquerors, warfare was a low-damage, high-profit affair. At the battle of Hastings in 1066, William the Conqueror gained the whole of England in a single day for the cost of a few thousand dead. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Nuclear weapons and cyber warfare</span></span>, by contrast<span class='card-underline'>, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>are high-damage, low-profit technologies</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. You could use such tools to destroy entire countries, but not to build profitable empires. </span>Hence in a world filling up with saber-rattling and bad vibes, perhaps <span class='card-underline'>o</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>ur best guarantee of peace is that major powers aren’t familiar with any recent example of a successful war</span></span>. While Genghis Khan or Julius Caesar would invade a foreign country at the drop of a hat, <span class='card-underline'>present-day strongmen talk </span><span class='card-underline'>loud</span><span class='card-underline'> but are very careful about actually launching wars</span>. Of course, if somebody does find a formula to wage successful wars under twenty-first-century conditions, the gates of hell might open with a rush. This is what makes the Russian success in the Crimea a particularly frightening omen. Let’s hope it remains an isolated example. Though, even if it is impossible to wage successful wars in the twenty-first century, that does not give us an absolute guarantee for peace. We should never underestimate human stupidity.</p><p> </p><p> </p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Healthcare is a mess – funding and coordination are alt causes.</div><div class='cite'>Michael Lighty 14, testimony from Michael Lighty, director of public policy for National Nurses United, to the California Assembly Health Committee, 11-25-2014, "Ebola Preparedness Without a Single-Payer System," http://www.pnhp.org/news/2014/november/ebola-preparedness-without-a-single-payer-system</div><div class='card-body'><p>This is a proud moment for California Nurses Association/National Nurses United, whose members have taken the lead in blowing the whistle for Ebola preparedness.

According to CMS data collected in 2013, patients in California Emergency Departments faced waits that are 23 minutes longer than the national average. Specifically, California patients waited on average more than two-and-a-half hours in the ED. Further, if a patient is admitted to the hospital, the average wait increased to: About five hours and 18 minutes from arrival to the time a patient is admitted; and Nearly an additional two hours before a patient is moved to a bed.

Sandra Hernandez, M.D. and chief executive officer of the California Health Care Foundation (CHCF), dedicated her keynote address to this topic at the recent 10th annual Health 2.0 conference in Santa Clara, Calif. Health 2.0 is considered the premier national conference for developers in the digital health space. Oakland-based CHCF is a policy institution which also operates an innovation fund to provide seed money to promising companies. “We are aging at a very, very dramatic pace,” Hernandez said during her keynote. “Yet we are chugging along providing a workforce the same way it was designed and built 50 years ago.” Here are some stats on the growing “silver tsunami:” By 2030, the U.S. population over age 65 will grow by 55 percent. By 2030, there will be a shortfall of between 7,300 and 43,100 primary care physicians. The median age of physicians and nurses is gradually inching up, meaning a wave of retirements in the coming years. In just California, the number of seniors who have trouble caring for themselves will increase by 88 percent by 2030. By 2030, at least a million seniors will need help with self-care such as cooking, bathing and cleaning in California alone. Most people prefer to “age in place,” meaning they will require home care and retrofits to their homes. The population will continue to become more diverse, requiring culturally and linguistically appropriate care for seniors. <span class='card-underline'>So how </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>can technology help solve these problems of shrinking </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>healthccare</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> workforce and an aging population</span></span><span class='card-underline'>? Here are few examples</span> cited by Hernandez and others during Health 2.0: <span class='card-underline'>Team-based care with technology support</span>. An example is Quartet, a software platform that allows primary care and behavioral health providers to communicate and collaborate securely while also conducting population health management. The CHCF is an investor in Quartet. <span class='card-underline'>Identifying and meeting patient social needs</span>. Seven out of the 17 minutes in a primary care visit is spent on social needs, Hernandez says. Examples of services that help primary care providers address patient social needs include HealthLeads and using text messages to connect patients with appropriate community services such as food banks. <span class='card-underline'>Tackling social issues that contribute to poor health in the elderly. Isolation and loneliness are significant drivers of mortality</span>. Loneliness can have a negative impact on senior health equivalent to smoking 16 cigarettes per day, according to Robin Caruso, the first-ever chief togetherness officer at CareMore, a medical group and health plan based in California. CareMore screens its members for loneliness and then provides counseling and peer-to-peer virtual interactions. You can read more about the program here. <span class='card-underline'>Voice-controlled smart personal assistants</span>: Investors in digital health said at Health 2.0 that they see tremendous potential for Amazon’s Alexa and Google’s Echo as platforms for at-home health care. Hands-free, voice-activated and relatively cheap, these systems can be used by providers to prompt patients to take their medications at specific times, transmit vital signs and conduct check-ins. How are your local hospitals, health plans and physician groups incorporating technology to help providers meet the needs of their aging patients? As Hernandez said: “What we really need to do is think about simple innovations that are going to allow us to completely rethink the health care workforce of the future.”</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Tech and logistic barriers overwhelm</div><div class='cite'>Keller 13 (Rebecca, 7 March 2013, Analyst at Stratfor, “Bioterrorism and the Pandemic Potential,” Stratfor, http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/bioterrorism-and-pandemic-potential)</div><div class='card-body'><p>The <span class='card-underline'>risk of an accidental release of H5N1 is </span><span class='card-underline'>similar to</span><span class='card-underline'> that of other infectious pathogens</span> currently <span class='card-underline'>being studied.

This day will have vast and long-term political repercussions for this White House and for the Republican Party that has supported this move. President Obama signed the executive order known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) in 2012, in the wake of Republican inaction on comprehensive immigration reform, shielding these young people from deportation to a country they do not know and to which many have no family connection. While deeply disappointing and heartbreaking for these kids and their families who will now live in uncertainty, limbo and fear, <span class='card-underline'>we should not be surprised by this decision from </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>this president, </span></span><span class='card-underline'>who </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>has proven to be the most anti-immigrant, anti-Hispanic president our country has had</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. </span>What else should we expect from a president who launched his presidential campaign by calling Mexicans rapists and criminals? <span class='card-underline'>What else should we expect from a president who promises to build a physical wall between the United States and Mexico, one of our most important trading partners and allies, simply as political bait for his </span><span class='card-underline'>anti-immigrant base</span><span class='card-underline'>?</span> What else should we expect from this president who insults a U.S.-born judge by declaring he could not be objective in his job simply because of his Mexican heritage? What else should we expect from a president who conjures up pernicious images of immigrants in this country, depicting them as killers, to <span class='card-underline'>inflame his supporters and excite the darkest devils of their psyche?</span> After all, this is a president who equates white-supremacist, neo-Nazi, racist, xenophobic, violent protesters with those who come out in support of civil rights, social justice and equality for all. Amigos, this is the man who was voted into the Oval Office by scapegoating immigrants, accusing our first African American president of being born in Kenya, and hiring well-known white nationalists as his closest advisors. Let’s be very clear. The president did not “wrestle” with this decision. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>He has talked about ending DACA many times during his campaign</span></span>. Sure, he sent mixed signals by saying he wanted to treat this issue and these kids with “great heart” but we all knew where he stood. If he truly “wrestled” with this, he simply would have shown leadership, kept DACA in place and worked with Republicans and Democrats to codify protections for Dreamers into law. After all, wasn’t this the president who boasted that only he could fix our nation’s problems? Some fix. More like a dodge. These Dreamer kids are some of the best this country has to offer. They work hard, have gone through background checks; many hold down two or three jobs to help make their families’ ends meet. Collectively, they contribute more than $460 billion to our economy in a decade. Many are summa cum laude graduates, or have fought, bled and died in our military for the exact same American values this president trampled on today so heartlessly. One Dreamer even lost his life while volunteering to save others during Hurricane Harvey. And this is how we repay them? For shame! We are better than this — though the president is not. Sadly, w<span class='card-underline'>hat Trump doesn’t understand is that this is not a partisan issue. This is a values issue.</span> Most Americans agree that Dreamers should be allowed to stay. A majority also believes they should be given a pathway to citizenship. Even majorities of Republicans, including three-fourths of Trump voters, believe Dreamers should be allowed to stay legally in the only country they know. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Trump is doing this to placate the very narrow and narrow-minded anti-immigrant nationalist core of his base because he is so weak otherwise</span></span>. It is as if he has given up trying to be president of the United States of America, and is seeking to preside over an even more divided America. That may <span class='card-underline'>keep him popular among his dwindling base,</span> but it is no way to win re-election or to give your party the edge in the upcoming midterm elections. There is a reason why so many Republicans have spoken out in defense of DACA and against the president’s draconian decision. Paul Ryan said last Friday he did not think it was something the president should do. Why are they speaking out now? Because Republicans know two things: that it will be very difficult for Congress to pass something Trump will sign, and that their party is in a perilous place if they and their president are the ones who callously threw 800,000 of our brightest students, soldiers, young entrepreneurs, community advocates and hard-working kids who are American — in every way that matters — under the bus. They also know 800,000 Latinos turn 18 every year. They realize Trump is at record-low disapproval among all Americans, and especially Latinos. Granted, the Latino vote was not enough to keep Trump from the White House in 2016. But the wave he is creating among not just Latinos, but among Americans who feel this president is a cancer on our American values, will be one that will flood the voting booths in 2018 and 2020 to get him and Republicans who stood with him out of office. It will be a wave not even Trump’s wall will be able to stop. Dreamers, America is with you. We will keep dreaming and fighting by your side.

"My parents gave up completely everything, my mom had left all her family behind for us to have a life here and I am forever grateful of that," said Ugaz-Valencia. For years, Nicolas and his family lived in the shadows, because they lacked legal status to be in the U.S. That got in the way of opportunities that most Americans take for granted such as going to college and pursuing a career. “The biggest challenge with higher education was the finances — and going to college is super expensive here. As an undocumented person you cannot get state funding, loans, in-state tuition. You either pay out of pocket or you get a scholarship, those are really the only options,” said Ugaz-Valencia. That all began to change in 2012, when then-President Barack Obama signed an executive order creating "Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals" or "DACA." The program offers immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children legal waivers allowing them to stay and work in the country. DACA recipients must undergo background checks and are required to renew their waivers every two years. Since its inception, roughly 700,000 applicants known as "Dreamers" have been approved for the program, including Nicolas and his two brothers. "<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Without DACA I can't work, without DACA I can't walk the streets safe thinking I'm not going to get deported," said </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Ugaz</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>-Valencia. “Knowing that it was going to be disbanded I was terrified every single day.</span></span><span class='card-underline'>”</span> Last fall, President Donald Trump said he would phase out the DACA program and ordered March 5th as the deadline to end it. But, a federal appeals court order has rendered that date meaningless. So, current enrollees can continue to renew their DACA status while the court decides whether the suspension can proceed. If it rules in favor of the administration, hundreds of thousands of "Dreamers" could be subject to deportation<span class='card-underline'>. “If you keep the DACA recipients in the United States and you allow them to legally work and live here, not only is that going to be a boom for the economy that is, they're going to earn more money and they're going to pay more taxes. But it's also going to grow the broader economy,” said Ike Brannon, Senior Fellow at the CATO Institute. </span>Ike Brannon, a senior fellow at the CATO Institute, a libertarian think-tank in Washington D.C has studied the impact of DACA recipients on the U.S. economy.

The bill would direct the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to cancel removal and grant conditional lawful permanent resident (LPR) status to illegal aliens and aliens in Temporary Protected Status (TPS)) who: were physically present in this country for the four years prior to enactment; were under 18 years of age when they initially entered the United States; are not inadmissible on criminal, security, terrorism, or other grounds; are not persecutors; have not been convicted of certain federal or state offenses; and have fulfilled specified educational requirements. The bill provides a waiver for the criminal removability bars "for humanitarian purposes or family unity or if the waiver is otherwise in the public interest." It would also provide for conditional lawful permanent resident status for aliens who have received Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), unless the alien had engaged in conduct rendering the alien ineligible for DACA since gaining that status. Finally, the bill provides for removal of the conditions on that LPR status, and contains a confidentiality provision barring release of information provided by applicants for conditional LPR status or DACA, subject to limited exceptions. That estimate states: CBO and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimate that <span class='card-underline'>enacting</span> <span class='card-underline'>S. 1615</span> <span class='card-underline'>would increase direct spending by $26.8 billion</span> over the 2018-2027 period. Over that same period, CBO and JCT estimate that the bill would increase revenues, on net, by $0.9 billion — a decline in on-budget revenues of $4.3 billion and an increase in off-budget revenues [Social Security taxes] of $5.3 billion. In total, CBO and JCT estimate that changes in direct spending and revenues from enacting S. 1615 would increase budget deficits by $25.9 billion over the 2018-2027 period, boosting on-budget deficits by $30.6 billion and decreasing off-budget deficits by $4.7 billion over that period. It also "estimates that providing higher education assistance for newly eligible people under S. 1615 would cost $1.0 billion over the 2018-2022 period." As the CBO explains: The bill would affect direct spending by conferring eligibility for federal benefits — health insurance subsidies and benefits under Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), among others — provided that those applicants met the other eligibility requirements for those programs. With respect to direct spending, CBO finds that S. 1615 would increase earned income and child tax credits by $5.5 billion between 2018 and 2027. It finds that the bill would increase spending for Medicaid by $5.0 billion during that period, and would increase direct spending for SNAP benefits by $2.3 billion in that timeframe. Direct spending for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits would increase by $900 million during that 10-year period under the bill. Finally, the bill would increase Social Security spending (which is off-budget) by $600 million, and Medicare spending by $300 million between 2018 and 2027. Federal direct spending for assistance for higher education would also increase, by $500 million in that timeframe under the bill, CBO estimates. Most significantly, however, "CBO and JCT estimate that enacting S. 1615 would increase outlays for subsidies for health insurance purchased through the marketplaces by $11.8 billion over the 2018-2027 period." In reaching the $0.9 billion revenue increase figure, CBO assumes that more employees would work "on the books", and therefore report their income, increasing revenue, "mostly in the form of Social Security taxes, which are categorized as off-budget." It finds, however, that "increased reporting of employment income would result in increases in tax deductions by businesses. ... As a result, corporations would report lower taxable profits and pay less in income taxes." In addition: "Noncorporate businesses, such as partnerships and sole proprietorships, also would report lower taxable income, which would decrease individual income taxes paid by the partners and owners." Finally: CBO and JCT estimate that there would be a $1.2 billion decrease in revenues over the 2018-2027 period associated with increases in the nonrefundable portion of the premium assistance tax credit provided through the health insurance marketplaces established under the Affordable Care Act. Therefore, CBO concludes, the increases in revenues "would be mostly offset" by the decreases. In the longer run: CBO estimates that enacting S. 1615 would increase net direct spending by more than $2.5 billion and on-budget deficits by more than $5 billion in at least one of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2028. Several factors would drive an increase in spending on federal benefits: <span class='card-underline'>The direct beneficiaries</span> of S. 1615 <span class='card-underline'>would continue to naturalize</span>, <span class='card-underline'>making them eligible to sponsor immediate relatives for LPR status without an annual limit. </span>The later recipients of conditional LPR status and all family-sponsored legal permanent residents would exceed five years in LPR status, conferring eligibility for full Medicaid benefits and SNAP. (Legal permanent residents who naturalize after five years also would become eligible for SSI.) <span class='card-underline'>Both the direct beneficiaries</span> of S. 1615 <span class='card-underline'>and their family members</span> who later receive LPR status <span class='card-underline'>would</span> pay enough years of payroll taxes to <span class='card-underline'>become eligible for Social Security and Medicare.</span> In reaching these conclusions, CBO estimates that 3.25 million aliens would potentially be eligible for conditional lawful permanent resident status, but that not all of them will apply for that status or be approved. Consequently, CBO estimates that approximately two million aliens would be granted conditional lawful permanent resident status under that bill. Conditions would be removed for 1.6 million of those aliens, and "roughly 1 million of the 1.6 million people receiving unconditional LPR status would become naturalized U.S. citizens during the 2018-2027 period, and that a substantial number of people would naturalize in the following decades." <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Needless to say</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>S.</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> 1615 will have a significant effect on the federal deficit</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Deficit reduction has long been a goal of congressional Republicans.</span></span> For example, Sen.

Similarly, although the estimate is less precise, for given average schooling, if the children reside in a </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>high skill price country</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> and thus have higher rewards for their skill, the probability and amount of transfers provided are lower</span></span>. Because only a fraction of the children reside in the home county, the direct skill price estimate is attenuated in this sample. <span class='card-underline'>However, it is notable that the higher the proportion of the immigrant’s children resident in the United States, who face a significantly higher skill price, the less likely is the parent to provide a transfer and the lower the levels of transfers.8 Finally, again consistent with altruism, parents with higher levels of schooling, given their children’s characteristics, are more likely to remit and remit more and those with no earnings remit less. The coefficient on actual parental earnings also has a positive sign, but it is not estimated precisely</span>.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>We now look at estimates of the probability that an individual child of the immigrant respondent and who is age 17 and above receives a transfer from the parent</span>, based on the subsample of 1,918 children who are neither citizens nor residents of the United States. The first column of Table 10 reports estimates from a specification that includes parental, child and country characteristics, with coefficient standard errors clustered at the country level. While the coefficient estimates conform to the altruism model, and to the immigrant-level coefficient estimates of Table 9 - <span class='card-underline'>child schooling and the log skill price have a negative effect on the probability of the child receiving a transfer and parental schooling has a positive effect - the coefficients are imprecisely estimated</span>.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>In the second column we report estimates that include a country fixed effect. Here the estimate of the effect of parental earnings on the transfer probability is positive and statistically significant, the effect of the parent-immigrant having no earnings is negative and statistically significant, and the child schooling effect is negative and statistically significant, patterns again consistent with altruism</span>. In the last column the estimates reported are from a specification that include a family fixed effect, in which are impounded all country and parent characteristics, measured or unmeasured. <span class='card-underline'>The estimates thus </span><span class='card-underline'>indicate who among of an immigrant’s children are more likely to receive a transfer. And the estimates again indicate that among the children, a child with higher schooling attainment is less likely to receive a transfer from the parent compared to her less educated sibling. The negative child schooling effect is statistically significant at the .04 level (one-tail test) and the point estimate indicates that a one-standard deviation increase in schooling decreases the probability of the child receiving a remittance by 30%</span>.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Remittance inflows counteracts inequality – resolves food insecurity for poorer people and creates sustainable climate adaptation</div><div class='cite'>Musah-Surugu et al, 18 – Senior Research Felow at West African Center for Climate and Environmental Governance, University of Ghana (Issah,  Albert Ahenkan, Justice Nyigmah Bawole, Samuel Antwi Darkwah, 2018, "Migrants’ remittances: A complementary source of financing adaptation to climate change at the local level in Ghana," International Journal of Climate Change Strategies and Management, DOA: 6-30-2018 ) //SS </div><div class='card-body'><p>4.6 Discussion of data</p><p>4.6.1 Financing climate change-induced incremental cost related to consumption. </p><p><span class='card-underline'>The data gathered support the claims that in times of environmental shocks</span>, <span class='card-underline'>remittances provide a significant financial buffer for poorer people</span> (Couharde and Generoso, 2015; World Bank, 2015; Quartey and Blankson, 2004; Findley, 1994).

Such <span class='card-underline'>diversification is based on anticipation of possible failures in their traditional revenue streams owing to climatic variability</span>. <span class='card-underline'>For many rural dwellers, investment helps them to maintain a range of income activities that protect them against expected poor agricultural or fishing season</span>.

As a result, <span class='card-underline'>many rural households tend to reduce risk by diversifying into activities with lower covariate risk to make consumption and incomes less volatile</span>. It was also observed within the transitional and Guinea ecological zones of the study area that many non-farming income activities tend to peak during the dry seasons when there is a decline in farm activities, which forces smallholder farmers to diversify their labour. However, it is remittance-recipient households that are more capable of engaging in other incomegenerating activities such as livestock rearing and marketing and retailing during the offseason. The use of remittances to invest in various productive activities such as risk diversification mechanism also confirms some previous studies that are of the opinion that remittances can be counter-cyclical, which could be used to invest in physical and human capital (Cooray and Mallick, 2013).</p><p>4.6.3 Financing climate change-induced incremental cost related to infrastructure.</p><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Remittance recipients’ households have on many occasions used their funds to improve or reconstruct their ageing houses and canoes or build new infrastructure </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>in an attempt to</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> boost their adaptive capacity against the impact of climate change</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>. </span>It has been reported that an effectively globalised communication system and lived experiences have provided good climate knowledge to farmers and fisherfolks in Africa (Mertz et al., 2009; Yaro, 2013). As a result, <span class='card-underline'>farmers and fisherfolks usually devise means to adapt to expected impacts of climate change and therefore invest some of their income (e.g. remittances) in activities that could boost their adaptive capacity</span>. The data from the respondents show that <span class='card-underline'>the decision to invest part of remittances in sustainable activities was based on their awareness of climate change</span>. This finding is consistent with previous studies which show <span class='card-underline'>that rural people in SSA have good knowledge of climate change and its related impacts</span> (Mertz et al., 2009; Mortimore and Adams, 2001). Similarly, surveying 11 countries from SAA, Maddison (2007) noted that significant numbers of rural people are aware that climate is changing and therefore find a way to adapt, accommodate or retreat. Evidence from the data also confirms that successful transition from hard-hit disaster homes to a healthy and resilient home in the study areas largely depended on access to remittances. This confirms King et al.’s (2014) claim that remittances support households to reduce their exposure to flood risk by building a flood-resistant infrastructure or relocating to a safer area.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Climate change disrupts <span class='card-underline'>food supply</span> and risks <span class='card-underline'>global catastrophe</span> – developing <span class='card-underline'>resilience</span> is key to prevent <span class='card-underline'>extinction</span></div><div class='cite'>Baum et al, 15 – Baum is the executive director of the Global Catastrophic Risk Institute, a think tank focused on existential risk.

This paper discusses options for increasing the resilience of food supplies to these risks. In contrast to local catastrophes, global food supply catastrophes cannot be addressed via food aid from external locations. Three options for food supply resilience are identified: food stockpiles, agriculture, and foods produced from alternative (non-sunlight) energy sources including biomass and fossil fuels. Each of these three options has certain advantages and disadvantages. Stockpiles are versatile but expensive. Agriculture is efficient but less viable in certain catastrophe scenarios. Alternative foods are inexpensive pre-catastrophe but need to be scaled up post-catastrophe and may face issues of social acceptability. The optimal portfolio of food options will typically include some of each and will additionally vary by location as regions vary in population and access to food input resources. Furthermore, if the catastrophe shuts down transportation, then resilience requires local self-sufficiency in food. Food supply resilience requires not just the food itself, but also the accompanying systems of food production and distribution. Overall, increasing food supply resilience can play an important role in global catastrophic risk reduction. However, it is unwise to attempt maximizing food supply resilience, because doing so comes at the expense of other important objectives, including catastrophe prevention. Taking all these issues into account, the paper proposes a research agenda for analysis of specific food supply resilience decisions.</p><p>1 Introduction</p><p>Human civilization is threatened by a range of global catastrophic risks. The severity of such catastrophes is so large (indeed, it may be infinite) that these risks are important even if their probability is low. And so, scholars over several decades have argued that reducing these risks should be an important priority for society today (e.g., Sagan 1983; Ng 1991; Bostrom 2002; Beckstead 2013).1</p><p>Several known global <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>catastrophic risks cause harm to human civilization by disrupting global food supplies, threatening severe global food security crises</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>.</span> Volcanic eruptions, asteroid and comet impacts, and nuclear wars all send particulate matter into the stratosphere. The particles spread globally, blocking incoming sunlight, rapidly lowering surface temperatures and reducing precipitation, and in turn lowering agricultural yields (Robock et al. 2009; Xia et al. 2015). A rapid increase in surface temperatures can follow from the abrupt cessation of stratospheric geoengineering, a technology proposed in response to global warming (e.g., Matthews and Caldeira 2007);2 this rapid warming could have similarly harmful agricultural effects. Even without geoengineering, natural <span class='card-underline'>climate change could also be abrupt</span> (Lenton et al. 2008; Valdes 2011). Plant pathogens and invasive species, including novel organisms produced through biotechnology, could destroy major classes of crops (Dudley and Woodford 2002; Mann 1999; Saigo 2000). There may <span class='card-underline'>be additional risks to global food supplies that have not yet been identified. These unknown risks could relate to environmental change, emerging technologies, and/or some other force</span>.3 Because so many known global catastrophic risks impair food supplies, it is likely that unknown global catastrophic risks would as well. Collectively, these risks make <span class='card-underline'>risks to food supplies one of the largest classes of global catastrophic risk</span>.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Ideally, these catastrophes would be prevented, such that there would be no major loss of food. </span>To the extent that these catastrophes can be prevented, efforts to prevent them should be made. However, such efforts may not succeed. Furthermore, some of the risks, such as volcanic eruptions, cannot readily be prevented. Finally, the unknown risks, if there are any, potentially could be prevented, but it is not known how to do so. For these reasons<span class='card-underline'>, it is possible that a global food supply catastrophe will occur</span>, despite efforts made to prevent it.</p><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The prospect of global food supply catastrophe suggests a role for increasing civilization’s resilience to such catastrophes</span></span>. <span class='card-underline'>Resilience can be defined as “the ability to prepare and plan for, absorb, recover from, and more successfully adapt to adverse events” </span>(NAS 2012:1). <span class='card-underline'>Risk analysts have increasingly recognized the importance of resilience in managing a variety of risks</span> (Haimes 2009; Aven 2011; Park et al. 2013; Linkov et al. 2014), <span class='card-underline'>including global catastrophic risks (</span>Maher and Baum 2013; Baum and Handoh 2014). <span class='card-underline'>A resilient system </span><span class='card-underline'>is able to</span><span class='card-underline'> retain critical functionality in the face of disruptions, even while it may make adaptations of noncritical attributes. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>In the face of global food supply catastrophes, a resilient global human system will adapt its food procurement practices to keep people alive and keep civilization intact</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>.</span></p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Remittances are better than government-led adaptation measures – provide specialized and localized relief</div><div class='cite'>Musah-Surugu et al, 18 – Senior Research Felow at West African Center for Climate and Environmental Governance, University of Ghana (Issah,  Albert Ahenkan, Justice Nyigmah Bawole, Samuel Antwi Darkwah, 2018, "Migrants’ remittances: A complementary source of financing adaptation to climate change at the local level in Ghana," International Journal of Climate Change Strategies and Management, DOA: 6-30-2018 ) //SS </div><div class='card-body'><p>5.

In fact, industrialization and <span class='card-underline'>overpopulation</span><span class='card-underline'> are helping to </span><span class='card-underline'>facilitate</span><span class='card-underline'> a </span><span class='card-underline'>mass extinction</span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>comparable to</span><span class='card-underline'> that of the </span><span class='card-underline'>dinosaurs</span>. According to National Wildlife Federation, in a report titled Population and the Environment, “nearly 20 plant and animal species become extinct every hour” (Effects of Overpopulation).</p><p>Along with fueling massive animal extinction, <span class='card-underline'>population growth</span><span class='card-underline'> contributes heavily to </span><span class='card-underline'>habitat loss</span>. Around the world, in low-density regions as well as in high-density ones, <span class='card-underline'>population pressures create incentive to clear and develop land, </span><span class='card-underline'>in particular forests</span>. <span class='card-underline'>Deforestation</span><span class='card-underline'> not only eliminates land and </span><span class='card-underline'>destroys ecosystems</span><span class='card-underline'>, but also fragments and changes many animals’ migration patterns and makes them easier targets for poachers. </span>In addition, the expansion of suburbs further and further away from urban areas clears significant amounts of natural land and puts many animals and plants in danger. To avoid the continuation of these patterns, humans must cease clear-cutting forests and promote vertical development rather than outward development.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Deforestation heavily contributes to habitat loss and mass extinction</span>, and our forests continue to thin every year. In 2004, a Population Reference Bureau article stated that since the 1980s, “agricultural expansion, logging, development, and other human activities caused the deforestation of more than 120,000 square kilometers each year” (Meyerson). By contrast, only about 12,000 square miles per year was being reforested. Because of human actions, as well as natural climate shifts, forests today comprise less than half the area they did at their peak (Meyerson).</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Overpopulation affects deforestation on a truly global scale, even in relatively uninhabited regions</span>. From deforestation-overpopulation studies to date, <span class='card-underline'>a clear correlation exists between extremely low population density and maintenance of forests</span>. Generalizing from these studies, at population densities less than two people per square kilometer, populations generally tend to be able to sustain themselves without agriculture and timber products (Meyerson). However, in many low-density regions, such as in many Amazonian areas, forests are being destroyed despite a lack of people. This would counter the claim that overpopulation leads to deforestation and habitat loss, except for the fact that most of this land clearing results from external factors such as demand for timber or livestock from high population regions of the globe (Meyerson). In order to satisfy the needs and desires of the ever-growing number of humans across the globe, forests continue to be destroyed in areas that do not depend on cleared land for survival.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>The developed world also feels the effects of land clearing and habitat destruction</span>. For instance, in Florida, from 1950-2000, the population rose at a rate of four percent annually. To accommodate the rapidly increasing population, almost of a quarter of the state’s land (all forest and wetland habitats) was cleared for human use. According to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, “in 1990, about 19 acres per hour of forest, wetland, and agricultural land [were] being converted for urban uses” (Effects of Overpopulation). And because of this massive growth, Florida’s ecosystems, on the whole, are more threatened than the ecosystems in all other U.S. states.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Suburban sprawl also contributes heavily to habitat loss and mass extinction</span>. According to the National Wildlife Federation, “<span class='card-underline'>The conversion of natural areas for homes, offices, and shopping centers has become one of the most serious threats to America’s native plant and animal species</span>” (Ewing and Kostyack). As the population grows, more land is needed to provide housing and jobs, and development stretches farther and farther away from urban areas. <span class='card-underline'>And with increased sprawl likely comes increased habitat loss and degradation. In fact, in the first quantitative study of the sources of animal endangerment in California, scientists discovered that sprawl threatens California’s animals more than any other factor</span> (Ewing and Kostyack). Low-density outward development destroys acres among acres of natural land and destroys the homes of thousands of plant and animal species, putting many in danger of population decline or even extinction.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Habitat loss, </span><span class='card-underline'>in particular deforestation</span><span class='card-underline'>, also fragments and alters animal migration patterns</span>. Not only are <span class='card-underline'>animal species unable to survive in the remnants of forested land left behind, but the “fragmentation of forests due to road, agriculture and human settlement development also impacts on wildlife by reducing the corridors used to move or migrate</span>” (Forest Animals Threatened). For example, years of illegal clear cut logging in the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve in Mexico has impacted the migration corridors for the endangered monarch butterfly. Millions of monarch butterflies migrate to the reserve annually for the winter months, but a thinning forest has the potential to change that as only an intact, continuous forest canopy can protect the monarchs “from both freezing cold during winter storms and from excessive warmth during the days” (“Deforestation in Monarch Butterfly Reserve”).</p><p>Deforestation also makes animals easier targets for poachers, as hiding and camouflage become more difficult. For these reasons, many species’ numbers subside and some eventually cease to exit (Forest Animals Threatened). In fact, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) approximates that human-led deforestation in the past 100 years has reduced the number of species living in forests by more than 30 percent (Forest Animals Threatened).</p><p>In many countries around the world, <span class='card-underline'>overpopulation fuels habitat loss and places many plant and animal species in peril</span>. As the author of the Audubon publication, Population and Habitat: Making the Connection, suggests, “<span class='card-underline'>The destruction of the natural world we see across the globe today is “fallout” from the human population explosion that has occurred over the course of the last 50 years</span>” (Effects of Overpopulation). Population pressures require forests to be cut down for agriculture, cleared for development, or harvested unsustainably for human consumption. In addition, rapid growth in the demand for suburban housing has pushed human development farther and farther away from cities, destroying more habitats and endangering more species. To avoid a continuation of the “sixth mass extinction,” humans must stop clear-cutting forests and attempt to promote vertical development rather than sprawl<span class='card-underline'>. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>If we, as a species, don’t change our behavior, other species will continue to die off, biodiversity will be threatened, and ecosystems will be threatened.</span></span></p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Remittances lower fertility in every region of the world – empirics and most comprehensive studies prove</div><div class='cite'>Anwar and Mughal, 16 –  Anwar is an Associate Professor of Economics at Cape Breton University; Mughal is an Associate Professor of Economics and Finance at Pau Business School (Amar and Mazhar, 2016, "Migrant remittances and fertility," Applied Economics, 48:36, 3399-3415, DOA: 6-28-2018 ) //SS </div><div class='card-body'><p>ABSTRACT</p><p>This study examines the role of migrants’ remittances in developing countries’ fertility transition.

The monetary aspects of international migration may therefore be more important for the region’s demographic transition than social remittances.</span></p><p>I. Introduction</p><p>The role that international migration and remittances resulting from the process play in the global economy has attracted increasing attention of researchers and policymakers. Although development impacts of international remittances have been extensively examined in a developing country context, such as those on poverty and inequality (Acosta et al. 2008; Adams 1992, 1998; Adams and Page 2005; Lucas 2005; Mughal and Anwar 2012), educational and health outcomes (Edwards and Ureta 2003; Fajnzylber and Humberto Lopez 2008; McKenzie and Rapoport 2011) and workforce participation (Amuedo-Dorantes and Pozo 2006; Funkhouser 1992; Görlich, Mahmoud, and Trebesch 2007; Makhlouf and Mughal 2013), demographic consequences of remittance flows have so far received scant attention.</p><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>During the last half century, the developing world has passed through a spectacular period of demographic transition moving from a high mortality, high birth regime towards a stable low infant and child death rates, low birth regime</span></span>. Migration is one of the key coping strategies in the societies faced with high population growth. Migrants relieve economic pressure on the community by seeking employment opportunities elsewhere. <span class='card-underline'>Money sent home by these migrants not only sustains the </span><span class='card-underline'>staybehind</span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>households, but</span><span class='card-underline'> can also modify the households’ reproductive </span><span class='card-underline'>behaviour</span>. This can take the shape of either the income or substitution effect. The additional household income that results from migrant remittances alleviates the economic constraints impeding the fulfilment of the stay-behind household’s pent up reproductive desires (the socalled ‘Malthusianism of poverty’), thereby allowing a bigger family size (Abernethy 1996; Stark 1981). Assuming children to be normal goods, higher income would allow an increase in consumption (Becker 1960; Becker and Gregg Lewis 1973). This effect can be termed as the remittances’ income effect on left-behind household’s fertility.	</p><p>On the other hand, <span class='card-underline'>improved household economic prospects as a result of migrant remittances</span> allow parents to develop their financial nest egg and reduce the need for children for ensuring parents’ financial requirements after retirement. This is particularly the case in societies where public social security systems are less developed and the traditional role of children as insurers of parents’ old age security from economic hardship is mostly intact. Lower financial constraints <span class='card-underline'>allow parents to focus on children’s human capital development, which leads to a further decrease in fertility in the subsequent generations</span>.</p><p>Moreover, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>better finances provide the migrant households access to previously unavailable medical care and contraceptive protection, and help the households attain the desired fertility level by reducing the risk of unwanted pregnancies</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Lower fertility through these channels could be termed the remittances’ substitution effect on fertility</span></span> (Beine, Docquier, and Schiff 2008 called it the old-age security effect). The overall impact of remittances on household fertility therefore depends on whether the income or the substitution effect dominates, i.e. whether remittances increase the ‘quantity’ or the ‘quality’ of children.</p><p>In addition to these monetary impacts of international migration on the migrants’ home-country fertility, migration directly influences the homecountry fertility through social remittances in the form of transfer of reproductive norms and practices prevalent in migrants’ host countries (Beine, Docquier, and Schiff 2008; Fargues 2006).</p><p>A handful of empirical studies have examined the role of international remittances in the demographic evolution of developing countries. Fargues (2006) explored the fertility situation of three Mediterranean countries: Morocco, Turkey and Egypt, and found that remittances are associated with lower fertility in the first two and higher fertility in the third one. He suggested that differences in fertility rates of the main destination countries for the migrants from these countries might be the cause of this divergent fertility behaviour. Migrants from Turkey and Morocco mostly reside in Europe where demographic transition is complete, while Egyptian workers mainly live in the states of Persian Gulf where fertility rates have until recently remained high. In a cross sectional analysis of global fertility evolution and international migration, Beine, Docquier, and Schiff (2008) found evidence for a small positive effect of international remittances on home country fertility. However, their study indicates a much larger impact of the transfer of fertility norms. In another cross sectional study, Mughal and Anwar (2014) concluded that the receipt of foreign remittances is associated with lower fertility rates among migrant households in Pakistan, and remittances appear to have the strongest effect on household fertility among all the economic factors examined. Naufal and Vargas-Silva (2009) also found evidence of a negative impact of international remittances on the receiving country’s fertility rates. <span class='card-underline'>Examining a panel of 59 developing countries, they inferred a negative relationship between remittances and fertility for the overall sample as well as for Latin America and Africa</span>. However, they did not find a similar robust relationship for Asian countries.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>In this study, we examine fertility responses of international remittances in the context of South Asia</span>. The countries that constitute the South Asian region include Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. <span class='card-underline'>South Asia’s significance lies in the fact that it is the world’s top remittance receiving region with $87.5 billion or 25.5% of the $343 billion global remittances received in 2014</span>. The region accounts for about a quarter of the world population, and is host to some of the highest population growth rates in the developing world. <span class='card-underline'>Traditional fertility norms still survive in many </span><span class='card-underline'>parts of the region, while focus on children’s education is growing as is contraceptive prevalence, even though access is still patchy and subject to households’ financial resources. As a result, either of the two effects of migrant remittances is possible.</span></p><p>South Asian countries have a diverse migration profile with sizeable migrant communities present in various OECD and non-OECD countries. However, more than half of the region’s migrant stock is located in the Middle East from where bulk of remittance flows to the region originates (United Nations 2013). If remittances to South Asian countries induce fertility changes in line with those in Egypt shown by Fargues (2006), remittances may end up slowing down the region’s demographic transition. In contrast, an opposite effect would suggest that migrant remittances are helping slow down the region’s population growth regardless of the migration destination.</p><p>II. Overview of fertility evolution in South Asia</p><p>South Asia is among the most densely populated parts of the world. Three of the region’s countries (India, Pakistan and Bangladesh) are among the world’s top 10 populous countries. India is the world’s second most populous country with a population of over 1.26 billion in 2014 (World Bank 2014), while Bangladesh has the highest population 3400 A. I. ANWAR AND M. Y. MUGHAL density of any medium or large-sized country at over 1,203 persons per square kilometre. South Asia’s fertility transition1 began late and the region has lagged behind most other developing parts of the world. Women of child bearing age in the region at an average gave birth to 6.5 children in the 1960s, and can still expect 2.9 children over their lifetime (World Bank 2014). <span class='card-underline'>From the 1950s to the 2000s, the mean number of children per woman fell by around 40% in Nepal and Pakistan, by 47% in India, by over 50% in Bangladesh and Bhutan, by 60% in the Maldives and by 65% in Sri Lanka</span> (Véron 2008).</p><p>As shown in Figure 1, fertility rates in the region ranged from a low of 2.2 in Sri Lanka to a high of 7.8 in Afghanistan during the 1970–2013 period. In Sri Lanka, the demographic transition started earlier than other parts of the region, and the process in the country is almost complete.2 At the other extreme, Afghanistan has only recently begun witnessing a fall in fertility rates.3 Barring these two outliers, fertility rates in the other six countries of the region are comparable, ranging from 2.4 in the Maldives to 3.6 in Pakistan during the 2005–2009 period4 (Figure 2).</p><p><span class='card-underline'>A feature of the region’s demographic evolution is the sharp fertility declines witness in the 1980s and 1990s</span>. <span class='card-underline'>Bangladesh and Maldives saw some of the sharpest drops in fertility witnessed anywhere in the world</span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> The total fertility rate (TFR) in Bangladesh fell from 6.3 in 1971–1975 to 3.3 in 1994–1996 (BDHS 1997).5 Remarkably, much of the drop in fertility in South Asia occurred at development levels much lower than elsewhere around the world (Ram 2012; Siddhisena and DeGraff 2009), and resulted from complex social, demographic and institutional changes in the society. For instance, Fertility in Sri Lanka and Southern Indian state of Kerala reached rates seen in OECD countries at per capita income about a tenth of the OECD levels.</p><p>Over all, TFRs in the four southern and eastern countries of South Asia are lower compared with countries located in the north and west of the region. At subnational level, fertility rates have fallen at a greater pace in more developed areas, with rural– urban TFR differing by one or two in several countries (Eini-Zinab 2013; Frost 2011; Ram 2012). <span class='card-underline'>Fall in birth rates in the region has gone hand in hand with decrease in infant and child mortality rates</span> (Table 1). Pakistan’s infant mortality rate (IMR), for instance, more than halved from over 180 in 1960–70 in 2013, while Maldives’ dropped even more spectacularly from 215 in the 1960s to 8 in 2013.</p><p>This sizeable drop in fertility rates witnessed in some of the countries of South Asia was partly the result of sustained government-run family planning programmes and exposure to radio, television and the print media (Caldwell 1982; Cleland 1994). Other major reasons behind the fall in the region’s fertility levels include marriage at later age (particularly that of women), increasing use of various forms of contraception and abortion. Early and universal marriage has historically been the norm in the region, and pre-marital motherhood is rare. Marriage postponement can account for 20–30% of decline in fertility in Pakistan and Sri Lanka (Abeykoon, 2006; Cleland 2001), where female age at marriage reached 23 in 2007. However, in other parts of the region, ages at marriage for women have risen more slowly. For instance, female Singulate Mean Age at Marriage (SMAM) for Bangladesh and India was still 19 and 20 in 2011 and 2006, respectively, with 44.5% of Indian women aged 20–24 years getting married before 18 years (Raj et al. 2009).6 <span class='card-underline'>In these countries, progress in contraceptive availability and abortions account for most of the decline in fertility levels. Use of contraceptive methods among women of child bearing age has risen from 13% to 53% in Bangladesh and from 35% to 55% in India. Although Contraceptive Prevalence Rate (CPR) has grown in Afghanistan too in recent years, the country still </span><span class='card-underline'>lags behind</span><span class='card-underline'> other countries in the region with a CPR of under 20% reported in 2010 (AMS 2010).</span></p><p>Across the region, contraceptive use is much higher among literate and educated households. For instance, Pakistani women with at least secondary education are twice as likely to use a contraceptive method as women with no education (PDHS 2008). Tubal ligation, oral contraceptives and condoms remain the most popular contraceptive methods in South Asia. Increase in access to contraceptive methods in the region during the last 50 years has been in great part due to government family planning programmes which have frequently accompanied reproductive health awareness campaigns.</p><p>Increased abortion is another cause of fall in fertility across the region. Although the practice is reportedly widespread, its extent is not fully understood because abortion is generally illegal and unrecorded (Véron 2008). In Pakistan, for instance, one in seven pregnancies is reportedly terminated through induced abortion (Sathar and Zaidi 2009). In India, abortion rates have climbed sharply since the widespread availability of sex determination technology, with the child sex ratio in 2001 reaching 126 and 122 in the Indian states of Punjab and Haryana, respectively (Ram 2012). Son preference is widespread in South Asia (Leone, Matthews, and Zuanna 2003; Zubair et al. 2007).</p><p>III. Overview of remittance flows to South Asia</p><p>During the past four decades, South Asia has been an important region of emigration. Substantial South Asian migrant communities have developed in the Persian Gulf states, Europe, North America and East Asia. Although South Asian migrants residing in all of these four regions send substantial sums of money back home, remittances from the six Persian Gulf states (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates) constitute the largest share of flows to the region. <span class='card-underline'>South Asia receives the highest amount of international remittances of any world region, with three of the region’s countries</span> (India, Bangladesh and Pakistan) <span class='card-underline'>among the top ten recipients in the world</span> (World Bank 2014). Aggregate remittance inflows to the South Asian countries for the period 1975–2013 are shown in</p><p>Figure 3.</p><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Remittance flows to the region exceed foreign direct investments, portfolio investments and official development assistance received by the </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>region, and</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> constitute the most important source of foreign exchange after exports receipts</span></span> (World Bank 2014). Relative to the size of the economy, the magnitude of remittance flows varies across the region with minor amounts received by countries like Bhutan and Maldives and substantial ones going to Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka (Table 2). In fact, <span class='card-underline'>Nepal receives one of the highest remittance flows relative to the GDP, with remittance flows in 2013 surpassing 28% of the country’s annual output.</span> At the regional level, distribution of remittances has greatly evolved during the past 30 years. In the 1980s, Pakistan received as much as one half of the total receipts, whereas in the 2000s, roughly the same share went to India. Figure 4 shows the countrywise distribution of aggregate remittances to South Asia for the 1975–2013 period. In addition to these officially registered remittances, significant amounts have traditionally been remitted to the region through informal means such as Hundi/Hawala and hand carry.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Remittances in South Asia decrease fertility – leads to higher human capital accumulation through more emphasis on education</div><div class='cite'>Anwar and Mughal, 16 –  Anwar is an Associate Professor of Economics at Cape Breton University; Mughal is an Associate Professor of Economics and Finance at Pau Business School (Amar and Mazhar, 2016, "Migrant remittances and fertility," Applied Economics, 48:36, 3399-3415, DOA: 6-28-2018 ) //SS </div><div class='card-body'><p>V. Findings</p><p>Tables 5 and 6 show various specifications of fixedeffect models. <span class='card-underline'>Remittances to South Asia are found to have a statistically significant negative association with the fertility rate</span>. Marginal effects computed from the baseline estimation (Table 5, column 1) indicate <span class='card-underline'>that a 1% increase in remittances relative to GDP is associated with a 1.7% decrease in fertility rate of the migrant sending country</span>. <span class='card-underline'>The association between remittances and fertility seems stronger and more significant than several other </span><span class='card-underline'>factors, and</span><span class='card-underline'> reflects the prevalence of the substitution effect rather than the income effect</span>. The latter effect which kept fertility rates high in the region’s traditional societies seems to have weakened. <span class='card-underline'>The substitution effect leads the households towards lower fertility by raising the opportunity cost of producing and raising children and shifts the quantity–quality equation in </span><span class='card-underline'>favour</span><span class='card-underline'> of quality</span>. Better financial wherewithal resulting from receipts from abroad also improve access to contraceptive methods among home country households which in turn leads to lower fertility.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>We also carry out the above estimations by using crude birth rate as an alternative definition of fertility. The results for the baseline specification (column 2) corroborate our main findings</span>. <span class='card-underline'>Migrant remittances retain their significant and negative association with </span><span class='card-underline'>fertility</span> . A one percentage increase in remittance flows relative to home country GDP is associated with 0.15% fewer births per 1000 population.</p><p>In contrast to Beine, Docquier, and Schiff (2008), we find mixed evidence for a significant transfer of fertility norms from the main host countries of the South Asian migrants as the migration stockweighted host fertility variable often shows no significant association with South Asian fertility rates (even though the sign of the coefficient is usually positive as expected). This is in line with the inconclusive graphical evidence seen in Figure A1. This finding may owe to the fact that South Asian migrant communities, particularly those in the Persian Gulf, are substantial in size and maintain close networks. Moreover, many South Asian guest workers reside in the host countries on temporary, often non-renewable job contracts. Socialization and interaction with the host society is therefore limited. As a result, fertility patterns in the host societies filter through slowly to the home countries.</p><p>Weighting the host fertility measure with respect to the male and female migrant stock of the corresponding South Asian country shows that unlike male migration, female migration is negatively associated with home fertility (Table A2). Among other findings, infant mortality shows a significant positive association with the TFR. Decreasing mortality rates in the region are therefore associated with falling fertility rates. This association is also valid for under 5 mortality (Table 6, column 1).</p><p>Likewise, the association between the share of child bearing women in the population is expectedly positive, though mostly insignificant. Alternatively, another age-related variable: the dependency ratio shows a significant positive association with TFR (Table 6, column 6). This throws light at the role of South Asia’s young demographic profile. Median ages in the eight South Asian countries are low (for instance, median age of Afghans is only 15 years (ElBadry and Swanson 2012), and women’s age at marriage are barely above 18 (19 in Bangladesh, 20 in India). Gradual maturing of South Asian population (and hence smaller proportion of under 18) should predictably be related with decline in the region’s fertility rates.</p><p>On the other hand, contraceptive prevalence seems to be playing its expected role: improved availability of birth control methods is negatively associated with fertility rates, even though the relationship is not universally significant.</p><p>Female labour participation’s association with fertility, however, is strongly significant, implying that increased access to work in South Asia during recent times has contributed to reduction of fertility rates in the region.</p><p>In contrast, <span class='card-underline'>per </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>capita national income shows a significant positive association with fertility, suggesting that at the early stage of economic development experienced in the region during the previous decades, more income does not seem to have helped reduce net population growth, as the resulting rising survival rates might have compensated for the decrease in birth rates in the region</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>.</span> <span class='card-underline'>The relationship is similarly valid if lagged per capita is instead used to </span><span class='card-underline'>take into account</span><span class='card-underline'> a possible time lag in fertility response to improving average household income </span>(Table 6, column 5).8</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Education shows an intuitive association with fertility, as primary school enrolment rates have a significant and negative relationship with the TFR. Girls’ primary education is likewise related</span> (Table 6, columns 1 and 2). The association also holds in the case of net primary enrolment rates (column 3). The relationship between education and fertility does not appear to go beyond the primary level as the association with secondary school enrolment (column 4) is statistically insignificant.</p><p>In addition to the above described parsimonious specifications, we consider several extensions to the baseline model by including other explanatory variables and alternative variable definitions:</p><p>Changes in government policy on population welfare and birth control may significantly influence the fertility rates through concerted media and social awareness campaigns. We construct two dummy variables that take the value of one for a particular year if policies for checking population growth and reduce fertility are in place during that year. Findings suggest a strong helpful role of government policies in lowering fertility rates in South Asia (Table 5, columns 3 and 4). As already discussed in Section II, sustained family planning policies, especially in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and India, played an important role in the remarkable drop in fertility levels witnessed in the region during the last three decades.</p><p>On the other hand, policies on healthcare represented by the public health spending to GDP ratio and per capita health expenditure seem to have little association with total fertility (columns 5 and 6). Similarly, the proportion of rural population in the country’s population is taken as an indicator of changing spatial distribution of the population (column 7), and the ratio of industrial and services sectors value added to that of agriculture taken as an indicator of changes in the economy’s structure (column 8) both appear to have no significant relationship with home countries’ fertility.</p><p>Table 7, columns 1–3, shows specifications with different remittance variables. Employing per capita remittance amount in place of remittance to GDP ratio (column 1) does not affect the significant negative relationship between remittances and fertility. Squares of the two remittance variables are included in addition to the two respective variables (columns 2 and 3). The squared variables exhibit opposite signs reflecting the non-linearity of the remittance– fertility relationship.</p><p>Columns 4 and 5 show estimations excluding outliers. India is South Asia’s largest and most populous country, accounting for around 70% of the region’s annual output. Afghanistan, Bhutan and the Maldives, on their part, are small economies with few available observations. The three countries together account for 58% of the missing observations in the dataset. Controlling for these outliers does not compromise the gist of our findings. An interesting finding from the estimation excluding India is that host country TFR’s association with home country TFR is stronger in the smaller countries. This is probably because several of these countries have proportionally large migrant communities and may therefore have a greater exposure to host country social and reproductive norms.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Remittance are likewise found to be significantly and negatively associated with fertility in the </span><span class='card-underline'>firstdifferenced</span><span class='card-underline'> model</span> (columns 6 and 7). The relationship maintains its statistical significance even though several variables are no more significant. We also obtain Arellano and Bond, and System GMM dynamic panel estimations. <span class='card-underline'>The remittance–fertility association obtained is again </span><span class='card-underline'>similar to</span><span class='card-underline'> the baseline finding</span> (estimations not shown).</p><p>To sum <span class='card-underline'>up, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>we find strong support for the substitution effect of migrant remittances on </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>homecountry</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> fertility. This finding is robust across specifications, variable definitions and econometric techniques</span></span>. Nonetheless, the evidence needs to be considered with a major caveat: The analysis is based on a dataset with a large number of missing observations, and relatively little data are available on some indicators (particularly those pertaining to policy or educational attainment).</p><p>VI. Concluding remarks</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Population growth rates in developing world have been high during the last half century. South Asia’s population, for instance, has grown from 573.2 million in 1960 to over 1.69 billion in 2014 </span>(World Bank 2014). <span class='card-underline'>This study examined the role of international remittances sent by South Asian overseas migrants in the region’s fertility evolution during the 1970–2014 period. We found that remittances have a </span><span class='card-underline'>significant association with decline in the region’s fertility rates.</span> This association is similar to the one found by Fargue (2006) for remittance inflows to Morocco and Turkey and unlike the one found in the case of remittances to Egypt. We propose that <span class='card-underline'>this helpful relationship may be due to rising opportunity cost of producing and raising children as household incomes increase thanks to migrant remittances which may be pushing the quantity–quality paradigm in </span><span class='card-underline'>favour</span><span class='card-underline'> of quality</span>. This highlights international migration’s helpful role in the demographic transition of the developing countries of South Asia, which exerts itself mainly through the monetary channel of remittances and not through transfer of social norms from the host countries as suggested in previous studies. These findings suggest that by <span class='card-underline'>contributing to the decline in the region’s high fertility rates, migrant remittances to South Asia participate in the human capital accumulation through higher emphasis on education</span>. International remittances can therefore be considered a useful flow of resources which contribute to the receiving countries’ future economic development.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Fertility decline key to multiplying fast growth – especially in the context of developing nations</div><div class='cite'>Karra et al, 17 – Assistant Professor of Global Development Policy at the Frederick S.

Our model is thus more useful for the insights it may provide into underlying processes and their interactions than for the predictions themselves. Including additional mechanisms in such a model adds realism but also increases complexity and risks decreasing the transparency of the findings. To make our model as transparent as possible, we include a full description of its structure and assumptions in Appendixes 1 and 2, and its parameterization in Tables A1 and A2.</p><p>We recognize that while our projections for the effects of fertility reduction are roughly double those that have previously been predicted, our estimated effects are generated by relatively large reductions in fertility (one birth) over a relatively short period of time (15 years). While such significant declines in fertility have been observed in settings where strong family planning programs have been implemented, one may ask whether it is realistic to assume that similar programs and policies can replicate such results in sub-Saharan Africa, where ideal family size and desired fertility are higher than in other parts of the world (Bongaarts 2011). Clearly, family planning programs have costs and the programs cited here were expensive (Simmons, Balk, and Faiz 1991). Nevertheless, even the most expensive family planning programs have been shown to be cost-effective when compared to other interventions, even without considering their effects on economic growth (Simmons, Balk, and Faiz 1991; Schultz 1992; Cleland et al. 2006; Hughes and McGuire 1996).</p><p>Like Ashraf, Weil, and Wilde (2013) and others, we acknowledge that the economic growth brought about by fertility decline would not be sufficient to help a developing country “vault into the ranks of the developed” (National Research Council 1986). <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>With that said, we argue that asking whether fertility decline alone could determine a country’s path to economic growth and development was never an appropriate question to begin with. </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>It is clear that there</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> are many determinants of economic growth, and it is also clear that demographic change brought about by a reduction in fertility is one of these determinants</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> We would also highlight institutional factors, such as good governance, a market-based economy, openness to international trade, public investment in infrastructure and education, and improvements in total factor productivity as additional important mechanisms in a holistic view of economic development. Even if fertility were to decline and income per capita were to roughly double as we predict, it would still not be enough to close the estimated 30-fold gap in income per capita between rich and poor countries. To close such a gap would require several doublings in income per capita (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development 2002). However, while not the whole story, <span class='card-underline'>our model suggests that reducing fertility can make a substantial contribution to economic development in Africa.</span></p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Mass consumption of resources ensures ecosystem collapse – extinction</div><div class='cite'>Gertz, 16 – New York-based journalist who reports on the environment and science, climate change, and conservation (Emily J.

All you need to know is that every living being has evolved to have a set of habitat requirements.</p><p>An organism can’t live where the temperature is too hot or too cold. If it lives in water, it requires not only an appropriate temperature range, but also appropriate salinity, acidity and other chemical characteristics. If it is a butterfly, it must have access to plants suitable for its caterpillars to eat. A lion requires plant-eaters to catch and devour. A tree needs a certain amount of sunlight and access to soil nutrients and water. A falciparum malaria parasite can’t survive and reproduce without Anopheles mosquitos in its habitat and a human bloodstream to infest.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>The human population has grown so large that roughly 40% of the Earth’s land surface is now farmed to feed people – and none too well at that. Largely due to persistent problems with distribution, almost </span><span class='card-underline'>800 million people go to bed hungry, and between one and two billion suffer from malnutrition. </span><span class='card-underline'>As a consequence of</span><span class='card-underline'> its booming population, Homo sapiens has taken much of the most fertile land to grow plants for its own consumption</span>. But guess what? That cropland is generally not rich in food plants suitable for the caterpillars of the 15,000 butterfly species with which we share the planet. Few butterflies require the wheat, corn or rice on which humans largely depend. From the viewpoint of most of the Earth’s wildlife, farming can be viewed as “habitat destruction”. And, unsurprisingly, few species of wildlife have evolved to live on highways, or in strip malls, office buildings, kitchens or sewers – unless you count Norway rats, house mice, European starlings and German roaches. Virtually everything humanity constructs provides an example of habitat destruction.</p><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The more people there are, the more products of nature they demand to meet their needs and wants: timber, seafood, meat, gas, oil, metal ores, rare earths and rare animals to eat or to use for medicinal purposes. Human demands cause both habitat destruction and outright extermination of wildlife. </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>So</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> when you watch the expansion of the human enterprise; when you see buildings springing up; when you settle down to dinner at home or in a restaurant; you are observing (and often participating in) the sixth mass extinction.</span></span></p><p><span class='card-underline'>The expanding human population not only outright destroys habitats, it also alters them to the detriment of wildlife (and often people themselves). The more people there are, the more greenhouse gases flow into the atmosphere, and the greater the impacts on wildlife that require specific temperature ranges.</span></p><p><span class='card-underline'>And </span><span class='card-underline'>th</span><span class='card-underline'>n</span><span class='card-underline'>e</span><span class='card-underline'> more people there are, the more cities, roads, farm fields, fences and other barriers preventing wildlife from moving to areas of more </span><span class='card-underline'>favourable</span><span class='card-underline'> temperature or humidity in a rapidly changing climate. Less </span><span class='card-underline'>recognised</span><span class='card-underline'>, but perhaps even more dangerous to both people and wildlife, is the increasing toxification of the entire planet with synthetic chemicals. Growing populations want myriad more items of plastic that often leak toxic chemicals: more cosmetics, cleansing compounds, pesticides, herbicides, preservatives and industrial chemicals. Many of these novel chemicals mimic natural hormones, and in tiny quantities can alter the development of animals or human children, with potentially catastrophic consequences. As with climate disruption, this is one more case of human overpopulation threatening </span><span class='card-underline'>civilisation</span><span class='card-underline'>.</span></p><p>So we don’t really need the evidence meticulously gathered and analysed by the scientific community showing the unusual and accelerating extermination of wildlife populations – and ultimately, species – to know that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>human population growth is a major and growing driver of the sixth mass extinction, just as it is with the related accelerating climate disruption</span></span>.

In general, the inconclusive results of the impact of remittances on economic growth are largely due to the difficulty of separating the cause from the effect: <span class='card-underline'>if remittances react countercyclically to growth, then the negative relationship between the two is a result of reverse causality running from growth to remittances, not </span><span class='card-underline'>vice versa.</span>33 Some studies have found remittances to have negative impacts on currency valuation and labor market participation.

While governments cannot tell migrants and their families how to spend their own money, <span class='card-underline'>policymakers can put in place sufficient incentives and mechanisms for migrants and their families to invest remittances in capital-accumulation projects (involving both human and physical capital) that are beneficial to the whole economy.</span></p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Remittances prevent civil wars – serves as an economic smoothing mechanism</div><div class='cite'>Regan and Frank 14 Patrick Regan is a Professor of Political Science at the University of Notre Dame and Richard Frank is a lecturer at the Australian National University’s School of Politics and International Relations (Patrick and Richard, “Migrant remittances and the onset of civil war,” Sage Journals, 2/24/14) // SR</div><div class='card-body'><p>Civil wars</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Civil wars have long been thought of in terms of competing centers of authority within one country</span> (Tilly, 1978). <span class='card-underline'>Models of the movement from political stability to armed civil conflict generally focus on the aggregation of economic and social grievances into a mobilized and armed opposition. The conditions that lead to grievances sufficiently intense to generate armed insurgent activity remain a topic of research, but various aspects of deprivation (relative or absolute), inequality (land or income), income shocks and avarice provide the foundation of our understanding of the institutional and personal motivations behind grievances</span> (Collier, 2000; Gurr, 1970, 2000; Midlarsky, 1988). General economic models of rebellion have been articulated by Grossman (1992), Azam (2001), Bates (2001), Gates (2002) and others. Most scholars, however, recognize that individual grievances alone are insufficient to generate an armed rebellion; some vehicle must help mobilize communities of people around a common set of grievances.</p><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>A substantial body of empirical research finds that </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>national wealth is one of the strongest predictors of civil war onset</span></span><span class='card-underline'> (</span>Collier and Hoeffler, 1998; Fearon and Laitin, 2003; Hegre and Sambanis, 2006; Sambanis, 2002). Interpretations of this empirical correlation, however, range from low state capacity to higher levels of material grievances. Our interpretation of per capita gross domestic product (GDP) as a predictor of civil war onset is consistent with the notion of low state capacity, but we posit that the functional importance of low state capacity is how it constrains states’ ability to offer political and economic concessions in response to opposition demands (Gartner and Regan 1996; Moore, 1998; Regan and Norton, 2005).</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Moreover, civil wars often break out along cultural lines, even though the evidence suggests that ‘‘ethnic’’ and ‘‘non-ethnic’’ wars have similar pedigrees (</span><span class='card-underline'>Sambanis</span><span class='card-underline'>, 2001). </span><span class='card-underline'>Gurr’s</span><span class='card-underline'> (1970, 2000) work points to cultural status and discrimination based on ethnic or religious identification as important civil war determinants.</span> Discrimination based on cultural characteristics can also increase a group’s ability to mobilize against the government by disproportionately encouraging grievances among a homogeneous population (Gurr, 2000). Many multiethnic countries survive the tumultuous seas of domestic politics, but when combined, ethnic dominance and economic deprivation can lead to groups coalescing around their common identity and common cause (Collier, 2000).</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Mobilization can be facilitated by recourse to cultural ties (Ross, 2007), firmly held grievances (Weinstein, 2007), cross-border affinities (</span><span class='card-underline'>Salehyan</span><span class='card-underline'>, 2009), and community or kin relationships (Petersen, 2001)</span>. Moreover, biologists see kinship or group identity as forming a key element in the survivability and fitness of groups in relation to other groups (Wilson, 2002). Game theoretic models of cooperation also suggest that within-group behaviors facilitate survivability (Axelrod, 1997). Put differently, kinship patterns are associated with group fitness, remittances can be viewed in terms of kinship support, and mobilization can be driven by strong kinship ties.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>If economic grievances can be linked to rebellious activity or civil </span><span class='card-underline'>war</span><span class='card-underline'> then mechanisms for smoothing economic difficulties should influence both the ability and willingness of aggrieved citizens to take up arms</span>. That is, communities rely on welfare provisions from the state, and to the extent that these provisions are constrained, insufficient or poorly targeted, local populations have increasing incentives to mobilize against the state. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Migrant remittances help dampen the shocks from economic instability</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>, which can in turn </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>reduce the pressure on the government from political opposition</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>.</span></span></p><p>Migrants and their remittances</p><p><span class='card-underline'>In 2010, there were an estimated 215 million people—or about 3% of the world’s population—working in foreign countries</span> (World Bank, 2011). <span class='card-underline'>By World Bank estimates. formal remittances from foreign workers amounted to US$372 billion in </span><span class='card-underline'>2011, and</span><span class='card-underline'> may account for as much of 30% of the GDP of recipient countries</span> (World Bank, 2011). <span class='card-underline'>Roughly two-thirds of this amount went to developing countries. This level of remittances is over twice the amount of global official development assistance (ODA) in the same year and almost two-thirds of foreign direct investment. Research finds that the home countries gain more from remittances than they lose in lost tax revenue from emigration. Adelman and Taylor (1990) calculate that Mexico’s GDP jumps by US$2.69 to US$3.17 for every dollar received.</span></p><p><span class='card-underline'>By way of comparison, ODA is distributed by governments to governments and any transmittal to individuals must go through the recipient government. Foreign direct investment (FDI) is another form of financial transfer, but in this case money flows from private industry to private or government industry. Distributions to individuals or villages and towns are a function of the vagaries of economic production through jobs and other forms of infrastructural development tied to industrial enterprises</span>.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>One of the key conceptual differences between these various financial transfers lies in how they are transmitted to the local level. In the case of migrant remittances, money is transmitted from individuals—often a relative—to individuals, forging a closer link between demand for and impact from remittances than more official transfers might provide</span>. ODA and FDI generally operate at the macro-economic level and often take years of budgeting and planning before they are implemented. The difference in mechanisms is so extreme that Miguel (2007) calls for a special program within the US foreign aid apparatus to (on an emergency basis) target the individual level as a means of forestalling political instability. <span class='card-underline'>Put differently, he calls for aid to work much like migrant remittances do, where short-term increases can be manipulated and targeted locally</span>.</p><p>Formal and informal remittances</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Migrant remittances are transferred via either formal or informal mechanisms</span>. This distinction is critical for our argument, and we stress that we focus exclusively on formal remittance mechanisms. <span class='card-underline'>Formal remittances are transferred through existing financial institutions, which are regulated, and ultimately subject to state-level decisions</span>. Western Union is one of the largest examples of institutions that handle remittances. <span class='card-underline'>An individual in one country deposits money, which is then transferred either through a bank or a Western Union office in the recipient’s country, where someone else picks up the funds</span>. Not only is the transmission transparent, but the office in the recipient country is subject to the policies of that country. US efforts to shut down transfers to Islamic organizations linked to terrorism can be seen as an example of how formal remittances can be controlled by placing constraints on the financial institutions (Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering, 2003; Elu and Price, 2012<span class='card-underline'>). Informal remittances, on the other hand, circumvent these institutional chokepoints by sending cash by hand, by </span><span class='card-underline'>courier or by local agents in the host and home countries. This is not always clandestine or nefarious in intention, simply another mechanism for kin to transfer money to their relatives.</span></p><p><span class='card-underline'>The World Bank estimates informal remittances might reach the level of 50% of those transmitted through formal mechanisms</span> (Ratha, 2003), while the IMF estimate is 35–75% (Freund and Spatafora, 2008). Conventional wisdom and some scholarship posit that remittances provide a potential source for rebel recruitment and arming, and as such constitute one of the facilitating mechanisms behind rebellion (Collier, 2000; Elu and Price, 2012; Gunaratna, 2003). <span class='card-underline'>Examples of informal remittances into civil war environments include the support of the Irish Republican Army from expatriates in the USA, the support of Eritrean rebels by the Eritrean diaspora, and support in Canada for in Sri Lanka’s LTTE.</span></p><p><span class='card-underline'>To date, the civil war literature has </span><span class='card-underline'>more often than not</span><span class='card-underline'> seen diasporas as a source of rebel start-up financing. We argue that those who postulate a rebel-funding role from diasporas are focusing on informal remittances, reflecting the smaller of the two remittance types</span> (Collier, 2000; Collier and Hoeffler, 2004a). Since the informal approach is not subject to the same level of state interdiction or regulation, this informal stream may indeed be a source for the funding of rebels. However, because informal remittances are outside any mechanism to record amounts or recipients, we have no way to verify or comparatively examine such claims. Regardless of how informal remittances play out, our argument and empirical tests center on formal remittances and how they influence civil war onset.</p><p>Remittances and economic cycles</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Evidence suggests that remittances are remarkably stable. Of five types of foreign exchange inflows—FDI, non-FDI private capital inflows, exports, official aid and remittances—the International Monetary Fund (2005: 73) finds that remittances are on average the least volatile. Remittance flows are also counter-cyclical</span> (Frankel, 2009; Singer, 2010; Singh et al., 2011). <span class='card-underline'>‘‘In those countries and in time periods where growth is relatively weak’’, the International Monetary Fund (2005: 73–76) argues, remittances increase both because ‘‘emigration increases and because workers already abroad increase their financial help to families back home’’. Thus, two factors are potentially at work in </span><span class='card-underline'>driving up remittances during hard economic times</span><span class='card-underline'>. First, recessions or other forms of economic stress can encourage those that can move abroad to do so. Second, those already abroad frequently increase the amount they send back to their families to help mitigate the worst of their families’ economic hardships</span> (Agarwal and Horowitz, 2002; Page and Plaza, 2006). <span class='card-underline'>Economic stresses can go beyond price volatility and can present increasingly difficult times for state institutions that transcend the ability of normal financial flows to moderate.</span></p><p><span class='card-underline'>For example, survey research finds that Philippine migrants’ remittances replace roughly 60% of economic loss owing to economic shocks, suggesting that, </span><span class='card-underline'>in spite of</span><span class='card-underline'> their overall stability</span><span class='card-underline'>, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>remittances are an effective mechanism for smoothing economic downturns</span></span> (Frankel, 2009; Yang and Choi, 2007). <span class='card-underline'>Yang and Choi’s panel design uses a household survey with a rainfall-induced shock as an instrument for income decline. During periods of such income decline the demands on social welfare resources by individuals and groups would be at their highest, while at the same time the ability of the state to provide those resources would be most constrained. Absent a financial accounts buffer, the state would confront difficult choices. The easiest among this constrained set of choices may be to cut social welfare provisions, a policy often advocated by international lending institutions</span> (Stiglitz, 2002). <span class='card-underline'>The cumulative effect of these counter-cyclical </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>remittances</span></span><span class='card-underline'> should be to </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>reduce the risk of political instability and civil war</span></span><span class='card-underline'> that is generated by social welfare contraction. Remittances are often intended to compensate for </span><span class='card-underline'>poor economic conditions in the home country, and therefore should have a negative relationship with income growth</span> (Acosta et al., 2008; Chami et al., 2005; Singh et al., 2011).</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Remittances often have a compounding effect at the micro-level on growth and development by increasing the recipients’ funds to spend on consumption, education and other human capital accumulation</span> (Acosta, 2006; Adams and Cueceucha, 2010; Calero et al., 2008; Rapoport and Docquier, 2005; Ratha, 2003; Yang, 2006). <span class='card-underline'>The long-term micro-level effect has macro-level consequences through the development of a state’s human and physical capital</span> (International Monetary Fund, 2005: 72). <span class='card-underline'>Researchers are thus converging on evidence that remittance flows are large enough to play a role in encouraging macro-economic growth and development</span> (Carling, 2005; International Monetary Fund, 2005; Keely and Tran, 1989; World Bank, 2006), <span class='card-underline'>and we posit that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>this economic impact has political ramifications in terms of government stability</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>.</span></span></p><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Remittances can also have a long-term impact in reducing poverty</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. Adams and Page (2003: 21–22) argue that individual remittances have a demonstrable macro-level ability to help decrease poverty, and they find that, in their data on 74 developing countries, ‘‘a 10 percent increase in the share of remittances in country GDP will lead to a 1.6 percent decline in the share of people living on less than $1.00 per person per day’’. Adams and Page suggest that remittances increase personal income and as a result decrease the number of structurally poor or severely impoverished members of a society</span> (see also Fagan and Bump, 2006; Page and Plaza, 2006).</p><p>Remittances and civil war onset</p><p><span class='card-underline'>We approach the moderating effect of remittances on civil war from the premise that most, but not all, civil wars result from grievances that can find their roots in economic hardship. That is, people are motivated to demand change when they endure forms of structural poverty, often triggered by income shocks; they are mobilized during these periods by entrepreneurs who can exploit this motivation. We recognize that political or social cleavages are important aspects of the grievance and mobilization process, but that economic distributions are often a function of political access and therefore social cleavages</span>. We also recognize that these are not independent conditions within any one society. <span class='card-underline'>Moreover, civil wars generally require a sustained period of grievances born of hardship before a sufficient level of mobilization can occur that would pose a challenge to the state</span>. Some type of trigger is often necessary to solidify opposition resistance (Harff and Gurr, 1998), and sharp economic downturns can provide one type of trigger (Miguel et al., 2004).</p><p><span class='card-underline'>While contemporary scholarship has not provided a sufficient empirical foundation for understanding the temporal sequence by which grievances and triggers interact to facilitate mobilization around an armed strategy for political change, we posit that longer-term structural conditions create the motivation to organize in opposition to government policy and that shorter-term economic and political constraints provide the immediate opportunity to rebel</span>. That is, mobilizing for an armed insurgency is risky and holds out a low probability of achieving its desired goals. <span class='card-underline'>Under these conditions opposition entrepreneurs can exploit the economic conditions to mobilize rebels in support of their cause, and there is greater willingness on the part of </span><span class='card-underline'>each individual</span><span class='card-underline'> to do so. Such economic crises also make it easier for rebel leadership to purchase rebel labor (Azam, 2001; Collier, 2000; Gates, 2002; Grossman, 1991). If the effects of economic stress fall disproportionately on a </span><span class='card-underline'>particular identity</span><span class='card-underline'> group—for example a minority already at risk (</span><span class='card-underline'>Gurr</span><span class='card-underline'>, 2000)—then the mythologies and common narratives can </span><span class='card-underline'>create a source for economic hardship that appears rooted in deliberate state policy</span> (Ross, 2003). We also see economic crises and political demands to redress economic constraints acting in concert.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>At the core, our argument is that </span><span class='card-underline'>economic crises which generate political demands lie at the foundation for the motivation to rebel</span>. That is, neither poverty alone nor weak state capacity will be sufficient to push disadvantaged groups into the ranks of rebel organizations. Difficult economic conditions exacerbated by persistent economic strains can turn the tide between enduring hardship and supporting rebel movements. <span class='card-underline'>Persistent economic struggles can be thought of in terms of a grind that threatens the status quo level of subsistence, at worst, or one that pushes otherwise comfortable conditions closer to the margins.</span></p><p><span class='card-underline'>In industrialized countries inflation is generally moderated by structured increases in wages, what we commonly refer to as cost-of-living increases. However, in countries without the labor structure or government capacity to offset increasing inflationary pressure with rises in income, inflation poses a harsh economic poison at the individual and societal level. Moreover, inflation for one year can be more easily addressed by government or industrial policy, but as inflation persists at high levels over extended periods, people can get pushed towards the margins and remedial policies become less adaptable. Economic decline also poses hardships on those closest to the margins, where declining domestic production leads to reductions in labor demands, and ultimately economic hardship at the individual level.</span></p><p>Economic recession in any one year—as with inflation—can be mitigated by policy and expectations, but chronic economic contraction poses more serious problems, both for the individual and for the state. <span class='card-underline'>Economic and political instability are linked processes. We know from prior research that political institutional instability is a strong predictor of civil war, where anocracy and transitions through an </span><span class='card-underline'>anocratic</span><span class='card-underline'> condition impose greater risks on the state</span> (Hegre et al., 2001; Regan and Bell, 2010). <span class='card-underline'>That is, political instability precipitates mobilization of an armed opposition group seeking to challenge the state for authority. The specific components that lead to instability within the institutions of government are less clear. We argue that economic instability and political institutional instability are linked, such that during harsh economic times the political institutions that already face an increased risk of civil violence confront pressures from two sides: the political elite dissatisfied with access to the political process, and the public dissatisfied with its economic plight.</span></p><p>In the face of political and/or economic difficulties, mobilization by the opposition is necessary for the onset of civil war. A government has policy mechanisms that can reduce the motivation to rebel, particularly policies that influence economic conditions or the distribution of national resources. <span class='card-underline'>If a civil war is less preferred than stability, then the smoothing of poor economic conditions by the increased influx of migrant remittances is in the interest of the individual recipients, as well as the government. Put differently, </span><span class='card-underline'>in spite of</span><span class='card-underline'> economic and political conditions that push toward civil war, </span><span class='card-underline'>external remittances can work to counteract these internal pressures </span><span class='card-underline'>by providing welfare payments that the government can no longer— or chooses not to—provide. Moreover, the state has an interest in facilitating the transfer of remittances, at least through formal institutions, which they can regulate.</span></p><p><span class='card-underline'>Continuing to provide for basic social welfare by smoothing economic contractions may be one of the keys to political stability in the most at-risk countries. While we do not propose a theory of migrant remittances, we postulate that expatriate </span><span class='card-underline'>family members remit out of both obligation and concern</span> (Agarwal and Horowitz, 2002; Amuedo-Dorantes and Pozo, 2006; Yang and Choi, 2007). <span class='card-underline'>During </span><span class='card-underline'>economic hardship family members living abroad would prefer a local sacrifice in return for increased security for their families ‘‘back home’’ over other options</span>. Panel studies tend to confirm this trend (Chami et al., 2005; Clarke and Wallsten, 2003; Rapoport and Docquier, 2005). <span class='card-underline'>Therefore, states have an incentive to permit, if not encourage, remittances from migrant workers during difficult economic times. Furthermore, since rebellion is both risky and costly, those families who are most burdened by economic downturns have an incentive to try to increase remittances from relatives during times when their status quo is jeopardized</span>.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>State capacity has many aspects, including but not limited to counter-insurgency efforts (Hendrix, 2010; Sobek, 2010). If economic or political grievances are at the core of insurgency movements, then letting market forces smooth economic declines might be less costly than counter-insurgency programs. Given the choice between policies that contribute to stability by facilitating externally generated social welfare payments (remittances) or counterinsurgency initiatives to snuff out rebellious movements, </span><span class='card-underline'>a policy of encouraging migrant remittances would be more economically efficient as well as socially altruistic.</span></p><p>There are two related components to our argument. <span class='card-underline'>The first is that economic instability contributes to the motivation to rebel against the state. Absent a grievance, rebellion is too costly given expectations of potential payoffs. Second</span><span class='card-underline'>, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>migrant remittances serve as an economic smoothing mechanism by which the impact of economic triggers is muted, therefore reducing the risk of civil war by moderating the incentives to participate in armed struggle</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>.</span> <span class='card-underline'>More directly, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>increases in migrant remittance will decrease the probability of observing a civil war during periods of economic and political stress</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> <span class='card-underline'>Two testable propositions derive from our argument: first, a more general expectation is that as a country’s migrant remittances increase, the likelihood of a civil war onset decreases. From this perspective we would expect annual changes in remittances to be a significant predictor of the likelihood of civil war onset. Second, and more specifically, as migrant remittances increase during periods of crisis, the likelihood of a civil war decreases. That is, migrant remittances have their greatest impact on civil war when they act in a counter-cyclical manner to economic performance. In the most entrenched economic downturns increases in remittances will reduce motivations to rebel.</span></p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Remittances undermine authoritarian party regimes and lower the risk of civil war – creates a spillover of civic and democratic values</div><div class='cite'>Escriba-Folch et al. 15 Abel Escriba-Folch is an Associate Professor at the Department of Political and Social Sciences of Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Abel, Covadonga Meseguer, and Joseph Wright, “Remittances and Democratization,” International Studies Quarterly, 2015, 571-586) // SR</div><div class='card-body'><p>The Political Consequences of Remittances</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Remittance flows to developing countries amounted to $325 billion in 2010, according to the World Bank, and continue to grow.5 Foreign remittances have exceeded official aid flows and non-FDI private capital inflows to low- and middle-income countries since the late 1990s</span> (Chami, Barajas, Cosimano, Fullenkamp, Gapen, and Montiel 2008:12). <span class='card-underline'>We see the same patterns in autocratic regimes. Further, remittance inflows are on average less volatile than other non-tax resources—such as oil rents and foreign aid</span>.6 Figure 1 shows that average oil income in autocracies remained steady through the 1990s and increased in the past decade as oil prices rose. <span class='card-underline'>While remittances also rose with oil prices in the </span><span class='card-underline'>2000s, foreign aid to autocracies has not evidenced the same spike. The rise of remittances in the past two decades means that some countries’ economies have become increasingly dependent on these flows.</span> In countries as diverse as Albania, Lesotho, Haiti, and Jordan, remittances constitute more than 15 percent of GDP. Do these flows have political consequences for receiving countries?</p><p>Relying on previous sociological and anthropological work, political scientists now explore how patterns of transnational engagement influence political attitudes and behaviors in home countries as well as how emigrants exert “voice” after “exit” (Hirschman 1978; Goodman and Hiskey 2008; Iskander 2010; Careja and Emmenegger 2012; Meseguer and Burgess 2014). Abundant case studies show that emigrants engage in the politics of their home countries (Levitt 1998; Kapur 2010). Yet, we know little about the macropolitical consequences of this transnational engagement for sending countries, as most studies focus on one country—mainly Mexico—or use individual-level data.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>One group of studies uses survey data that asks respondents about their migratory experience—including receiving remittances—and political behavior. Other research examines how remittances affect electoral outcomes, such as voting for incumbent parties. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Whereas the first set of work finds that emigration has a demobilizing effect, the second shows that remittances generally reduce electoral support for incumbent parties and thus may </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>further political change</span></span>. <span class='card-underline'>Extant research therefore associates remittances with both decreased political mobilization and increased political change at the same time</span>. In this section, we review the mechanisms for these two opposing effects and then, in the next section, discuss how these mechanisms influence the prospects of democratization in different autocratic contexts.</p><p>Using a variety of surveys based on Mexican respondents, Perez-Armendariz and Crow (2010), Goodman and Hiskey (2008), and Germano (2013) find that emigration experience reduces certain types of political behavior, such as voting, talking about politics, punishing incumbent parties in elections, and seeking political information. Two mechanisms may explain these findings. <span class='card-underline'>First, Goodman and </span><span class='card-underline'>Hiskey</span><span class='card-underline'> (2008:170) posit that having relatives abroad and receiving remittances reorient individuals toward transnational political activities as they rely more on families and less on the state to satisfy their needs. Second, and more importantly, remittances may insulate recipient households from domestic economic conditions and thus </span><span class='card-underline'>reduce economic grievances</span>. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Remittances</span></span><span class='card-underline'> usually accrue to households in countercyclical patterns, which help to </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>smooth domestic economic shocks and consumption volatility</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. This might reduce dissatisfaction with the incumbent regime and preclude political change, perhaps </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>by </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>lowering the risk of civil war</span></span> (Regan and Frank 2014:5–8).</p><p><span class='card-underline'>In contrast, other studies contend that remittances foster political change, and even democratization, via three main mechanisms: an income effect, contentious mobilization, and social learning. First, remittances increase recipient households’ income, which in turn augment resources necessary for political participation,</span> such as time and money. <span class='card-underline'>One version of this argument posits that additional non-labor income in the form of remittances makes individuals less dependent on the state’s </span><span class='card-underline'>clientelistic</span><span class='card-underline'> spending, prompting individuals to reduce their electoral support for incumbent parties or to </span><span class='card-underline'>engage in other forms of participation such as protests</span>. For example, using municipal election data in Mexico, Pfutze (2012, 2014) tests the social learning and the income mechanism but only finds support for the latter: <span class='card-underline'>Remittances reduce turnout for the ruling </span><span class='card-underline'>Partido</span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>Revolucionario</span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>Institucional</span><span class='card-underline'> (PRI) in municipalities where the PRI was entrenched</span>. Similarly, Diaz-Cayeros, Magaloni, and Weingast (2003) show that a higher percentage of a municipal population living in the United States—a proxy for remittances—is associated with municipality defection from the PRI and voting for the opposition.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Second, remittances may support </span><span class='card-underline'>particular candidates</span><span class='card-underline'> and parties in receiving countries or finance protest activities back home</span>.7 <span class='card-underline'>Remittances thus influence domestic politics in sending countries when they directly fund opposition political groups</span>. Migrant diasporas, for example, are a key source of financing for some domestic rebel groups, which increases the feasibility of an armed uprising and, as a result, raises the likelihood of civil conflict (Collier and Hoeffler 2004: 565, 568). Using survey data from sub-Saharan Africa, Dionne, Inman, and Montinola (2014) show that individuals who report receiving remittances are more likely to participate in protests but less likely to vote than those who report receiving no remittances. In more institutionalized polities, remittances finance legal opposition parties and thus increase their capacity to challenge the incumbents in elections.8 Others find that emigrant remittances increase the resources available for collective challenges to the state, increasing the risk of civil war (Miller and Ritter 2014).</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Third, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>remittances</span></span><span class='card-underline'> may </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>involve the transfer</span></span><span class='card-underline'> of “social remittances,” which consist of the </span><span class='card-underline'>flow of </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>new ideas, values, and behaviors from migrants to their sending countries</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>(Levitt 1998). <span class='card-underline'>The transfer of social remittances occurs through long-distance cross-border interactions, face-to-face cross-border interactions, and migration information networks </span>(Levitt 1998; Perez-Armendariz and Crow 2010; Perez-Armendariz 2014). <span class='card-underline'>Thus, contact with emigrant relatives may increase participation and dissent through a process of social learning via the </span><span class='card-underline'>spillover of civic and democratic values</span>, <span class='card-underline'>which alter the distribution of political preferences and behaviors in sending communities</span> (Pfutze 2012, 2014; Perez-Armendariz 2014). <span class='card-underline'>For example, Perez-Armendariz and Crow (2010) find that knowing migrants—whether friends or relatives— increases political participation as well as dissatisfaction with incumbents in Mexico.</span></p><p>Most current research focuses on how remittances influence politics in new democracies and specifically Mexico (Goodman and Hiskey 2008; Perez-Armendariz and Crow 2010; Tyburski 2012; Germano 2013; Perez-Armendariz 2014; Pfutze 2014).9 However, research on the political influence of remittances need not be restricted to democratic settings (Diaz-Cayeros et al. 2003; Pfutze 2012). The only paper that examines remittances and macropolitical change using a broad sample of autocracies is Ahmed (2012), which examines two types of foreign income together: aid and remittances.10 This study posits that autocracies use aid to finance patronage (an income effect) and that as remittances increase private consumption, governments divert expenditures from the provision of welfare to private spending (a substitution effect). Both mechanisms result in extra resources for regimes to fund patronage. However, as noted above, inflows of aid—if fungible—accrue directly to the state while individual remittances accrue largely to households. Hence, these two income flows may have distinct (even opposite) effects on democratization. Moreover, by focusing on how autocracies differ from democracies, this research ignores the question of how regimes in different autocratic contexts benefit from or are harmed by remittance flows. The next section discusses the proposed mechanisms linking remittances to the prospects of democratic change in different autocratic regimes and advances a theory to explain why remittances further democracy in party-based dictatorships.</p><p>Remittances and Autocratic Regime Survival</p><p>Are some regimes more vulnerable to workers’ remittances? <span class='card-underline'>Autocratic regimes differ along many dimensions, such as the size of their support coalition (Bueno de Mesquita, Smith, </span><span class='card-underline'>Siverson</span><span class='card-underline'>, and Morrow 2003), the group from which elite supporters are selected (Geddes 1999), and the extent to which they </span><span class='card-underline'>co-opt potential opponents with policy concessions (Gandhi 2008). These characteristics influence a regime’s durability and its vulnerability to domestic and foreign shocks</span>. <span class='card-underline'>We argue that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>foreign remittances reduce citizens’ dependence on government transfers and public goods and thus destabilize autocracies</span></span>. <span class='card-underline'>By giving individuals and households an exit option from the regime’s patronage network, remittances sever the </span><span class='card-underline'>clientelistic</span><span class='card-underline'> link between voters and incumbent dictators causing defections from their support coalition. Further, by increasing the resources of opposition parties and groups, remittances may increase the capacity of these parties to challenge the regime in autocratic elections</span>.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>These mechanisms, we argue, are more likely to occur in dictatorships that hold multiparty elections regularly and rely primarily on broad-based distribution of goods to purchase the loyalty of large coalitions and deter investment in the opposition. Concretely, remittances should </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>reduce voters’ dependency on state-delivered goods</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> and thus </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>undermine dominant-party-regimes’ capacity to mobilize political support</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>.</span></span></p><p><span class='card-underline'>Dominant-party-regimes are dictatorships in which “a party organization exercises some power over the leader at least part of the time, controls the career paths of officials, organizes the distribution of benefits to supporters, and mobilizes citizens to vote and show support for party leaders in other ways” </span>(Geddes 1999:124). The latter two features help us understand how remittances weaken these regimes. <span class='card-underline'>Dominant-party dictatorships tend to have broader and deeper support coalitions than other regimes. Their survival therefore depends not only on institutionalized power-sharing agreements and the provision of private goods to top party officials and other elites (patronage), but also on the delivery of (often local) public goods to large segments of the population (clientelism) aimed at mobilizing mass support</span> (Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2003:87; Magaloni and Kricheli 2010; Malesky, Abrami, and Zheng 2011). <span class='card-underline'>Thus, parties not only serve to channel elites’ demands and credibly share power with significant groups, but also work as large </span><span class='card-underline'>clientelistic</span><span class='card-underline'> machines through which benefits are distributed in an effort to mobilize supporters</span> (Magaloni 2006:15, 65–66; Greene 2007:40, 2010; Pepinsky 2007:143; Levitsky and Way 2010:66–67).11 <span class='card-underline'>The party’s ability to politicize public resources, transforming them into patronage goods, enhances its capacity to organize the distribution of benefits to supporters (Greene 2010:808). This usually results in party-regimes having large public sectors</span> (Desai, Olofsgard, and Yousef 2009:111; Greene 2010).</p><p><span class='card-underline'>The party monopoly over state resources makes it possible for the regime to control access to public housing, social services, property, fertilizers, subsidies, scholarships, jobs, and even food. And, most importantly, it allows the incumbent to make this access conditional on support for the regime party. This ensures that important segments of society depend on the regime economically</span> (Magaloni and Kricheli 2010<span class='card-underline'>). Benefits to citizens also take the form of private goods</span>. For example, the People’s Action Party’s (PAP) public housing programs in Singapore are a key source of support and votes for the regime since 1960. During elections in Malaysia, workers from the ruling party, the United Malays National Organization (UMNO), visit rural households to dispense cash payments to supporters and deter opponent mobilization (Pepinsky 2007:144). But most commonly, the benefits delivered from dominant parties take the form of targeted public goods and services. In Malaysia, federal politicians distributed grants for rural development to local clients to reward support for UMNO (Pepinsky 2007:146). Blaydes (2011:74) shows that during Mubarak’s rule in Egypt, areas that voted for the opposition saw little improvement in sewerage and water coverage between the mid-1980s and 1990s. The PRI in Mexico systematically directed PRONASOL funds, mainly consisting of public works targeting municipalities, to ensure voters’ loyalty in contested municipalities and withdrawn from those supporting the opposition (Magaloni 2006:68, Chapter 4).</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Individuals receive targeted benefits and public goods and services in exchange for supporting the regime. This support may entail tacit acquiescence or party membership, but also often involves endorsing the ruling party in elections</span>. Elections are not uncommon in dictatorships; indeed, a majority of dictatorships held multiparty elections in the past decade (Gandhi and Lust-Okar 2009; Hyde and Marinov 2012). Almost all dominant-partyregimes hold regular national elections, and these regimes hold elections more frequently than other types of autocracies (Geddes 2003). Autocrats use elections to deal with different kinds of threats and intend to win them (Gandhi and Lust-Okar 2009). Consequently, among other strategies such as voter intimidation and restrictions on opposition parties, party-regimes exploit their resource advantage to fund clientelistic practices— where ruling parties exchange votes for material benefits and services—and to enjoy a privileged economic and media position during electoral campaigns (Dixit and Londegran 1996; Magaloni 2006; Greene 2010).</p><p><span class='card-underline'>The previous section identified three mechanisms through which remittances may foster political change: severing </span><span class='card-underline'>clientelistic</span><span class='card-underline'> links between citizens and the ruling party; increasing funding for opposition parties and groups; and social remittances, or the spillover of civic and democratic values. Our hypothesis suggests that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>remittances should undermine autocratic survival in dominant-party-regimes</span></span><span class='card-underline'> principally through the income effect of remittances and possibly through an increase in resources available to opposition parties. We argue </span><span class='card-underline'>that </span><span class='card-underline'>remittances weaken party-regimes </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>by reducing citizens’ dependence on </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>clientelistic</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> transfers</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and thus increase their economic autonomy, namely their “ability to earn a living independent of the state”</span> (McMann 2006:28). <span class='card-underline'>By increasing private income, remittances reduce the marginal utility of state-provided targeted benefits as well as local public goods and services</span>.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>This argument builds on the stylized fact that </span><span class='card-underline'>remittances increase household consumption</span><span class='card-underline'> to acquire goods and thus represent a substitute for goods provided by the regime. Existing research shows that recipient households use remittance income to finance private consumption but also as investments in education, health, agriculture, and business</span> (World Bank 2006a,b; Fajnzylber and Lopez 2007:23–33; Chami et al. 2008<span class='card-underline'>). Additionally, remittances enable citizens to obtain local public goods that substitute for government welfare and infrastructure expenditures</span>. For example, Adida and Girod (2011:17) find that Mexican households use remittances to purchase access to public services, such as sanitation and clean water, undermining the state monopoly on the provision of these goods. <span class='card-underline'>In Yemen, during the 1970s, local cooperatives used remittances to invest in road construction, schools, clinics, and farming projects (Chaudhry 1989:133–134). In Senegal, migrant associations (</span><span class='card-underline'>dahiras</span><span class='card-underline'>) use remittances to fund projects and social services in their communities of origin “without having to rely on state intervention</span>” (Diedhiou 2011:6). <span class='card-underline'>These examples suggest that remittances provide households and individuals with an “exit” from the regime’s </span><span class='card-underline'>clientelistic</span><span class='card-underline'> network</span> (Diaz-Cayeros et al. 2003; Ahmed 2011; Pfutze 2012).</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Two requisite conditions underpin the logic of the income effect: (1) Remittance recipients care about ideological preferences, and (2) the regime cannot substantially expand its budget by extracting revenue from remittances, which they then use to buy political support from remittance households. The first condition is a standard assumption in models of clientelism, where voter utility is a positive function of income and a negative function of support for the regime/incumbent party as captured by the distance between their own ideological position and that of the party they support</span>. Hence, clientelistic transfers decrease (to zero at the limit) as an individual’s support for the regime increases or as the voter’s ideology moves closer to the incumbent party’s position. Transfers, in these models, are the price the regime pays to alter the individuals’ political behavior.12 As Magaloni and Kricheli (2010:128) argue, <span class='card-underline'>“[c]</span><span class='card-underline'>itizens</span><span class='card-underline'> with alternative sources of income can better afford to make ‘ideological investments’ in democratization and oppose the regime.” Likewise, McMann (2006:28) posits that “economic autonomy” explains citizens’ willingness to challenge local authorities instead of self-censoring their preferences.</span> <span class='card-underline'>Further, </span><span class='card-underline'>clientelistic</span><span class='card-underline'> networks easily trap poorer voters, as lower incomes reduce the price the regime must pay in exchange for support. Substantial evidence suggests that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>remittances benefit the poor and help reduce poverty</span></span>.13 <span class='card-underline'>By increasing income and thus the monetary value of transfers needed to buy support, remittances weaken state clientelism, lowering the marginal utility of such transfers and increasing the importance of ideological preferences in voting and other political decisions.</span></p><p><span class='card-underline'>The second condition is that the regime does not substantially augment its resources by capturing remittances, which are then used to offset the increase in the price of continued support. Numerous studies agree that remittances are largely nontaxable</span> (Chaudhry 1989; Abdih et al. 2012; Ahmed 2012; Pfutze 2012, 2014). The World Bank (2006a:93), for example, notes that “[m]ost remittance-receiving countries today do not impose taxes on incoming remittances.” In practice, governments rarely tax remittances directly because they are highly elastic to the tax rate as remitters can easily evade formal controls (Eckstein 2010). Thus, directly taxing remit tances is likely to result in fewer remittances sent through formal channels (Freund and Spatafora 2008<span class='card-underline'>). For this reason, we follow the extant research in suggesting that remittances are generally not taxable and do not substantially increase nondemocratic governments’ revenues.</span>14</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Empirical tests of this argument in Mexico show that remittances decrease votes cast for the incumbent and benefit the opposition by weakening of </span><span class='card-underline'>clientelistic</span><span class='card-underline'> ties</span> (Pfutze 2012, 2014). Dahou and Foucher (2009:17) concur, noting that “[t]he shift of the Senegalese economy from groundnuts to migration and its increasing dependence on resources generated abroad could be seen as the final stage in the process of ending the hegemony once enjoyed by the state over Senegalese society.” Senegal transitioned to democracy in 2000 when the incumbent Socialist Party lost the presidential election. However, we lack systematic tests of this argument for a large number of autocracies.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Thus, we expect </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>remittances to increase the likelihood of democratic transition</span></span>. We should find the strongest support for this expectation in dominant-party dictatorships as opposed to other autocracies because the former typically (i) have organized opportunities for collective action and the expression of dissent, particularly via elections and (ii) have broader and deeper support coalitions comprising poor households in which we expect the income effect of remittances to operate most strongly. <span class='card-underline'>To explore the proposed mechanism linking remittances to democratization, we further examine whether remittances alter electoral behavior in autocracies in a way that punishes the incumbent</span>.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>First, weakening clientelism permits individuals to revise their evaluation of the government and express their true preferences about the regime. When the utility of registering</span> <span class='card-underline'>disapproval of the regime—given remittances—is larger than that of supporting it, expressing dissent cannot be too costly. On one hand, dominant-party-regimes are both less repressive (Davenport 2007) and more likely to have regular, institutionalized mechanisms for leadership turnover that typically occur through elections (</span>Geddes 2003). If the ruling party loses an election, this generally leads to a democratic transition. In other regimes, in contrast, destabilizing dissent more often entails contentious collective action (Ulfelder 2005).</p><p>Second, dominant-party-regimes have broader winning coalitions than other autocracies and politicize public resources to mobilize support. To retain power, the regime party typically wins elections. <span class='card-underline'>Broader support coalitions in these dictatorships are more likely to contain poorer households that rely on remittances. In many countries, the share of households that receive remittances is substantia</span>l.15 Further, the positive income effect of remittances may not be limited to direct recipients, as foreign income can have multiplier effects leading to improvements in the living conditions of non-migrant households as well (World Bank 2006a: 70, 95). <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>These </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>spillover effects</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> increase “environmental economic autonomy”</span></span> (McMann 2006:31–34). <span class='card-underline'>Through the income mechanism, remittances undermine </span><span class='card-underline'>clientelistic</span><span class='card-underline'> ties and make some individuals and localities more likely to manifest disapproval or withdraw their support for the regime party</span>. Elections reflect the loss of political support from the coalition, as a decline in turnout for the incumbent party may lead to electoral victory for opposition parties, as occurred in Mexico and Senegal in 2000.</p><p>Other dictatorships—particularly personalist regimes— also rely on the distribution of benefits to supporters, but they are more likely to have a relatively small coalition comprised mainly of individuals with family and ethnic ties to the leader (Geddes 2003:72–74). In contrast, party-regimes more often co-opt large groups of potential opponents into the support coalition or rely on large preexisting organizations such as labor unions or independence movements (Bratton and van de Walle 1994; Geddes 1999; Smith 2005). In personalist dictatorships, which typically have smaller support coalitions than party dictatorships, this group is less likely to contain poorer individuals whose main income comes from remittances. <span class='card-underline'>The political support of relatively </span><span class='card-underline'>lowincome</span><span class='card-underline'> supporters is therefore less likely to be necessary to retain power in non-party-based regimes. Further, benefits accruing to each member of a personalist coalition are private goods and thus substantially larger</span> (Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2003:129–132). <span class='card-underline'>It is therefore less likely that utility from remittances exceeds the benefits obtained by supporting the regime. Thus, even though patronage politics is central to the logic of personalist rule, we do not expect remittances to undermine the patronage links between regime supporters and the dictator in personalist regimes</span>.16 In military regimes, patronage may be present too but it is not the main instrument such regimes use to retain power. Rather, repression and institutional power-sharing between branches or factions within the military are the most significant instruments (Davenport 2007; Geddes, Frantz, and Wright 2014a).</p><p><span class='card-underline'>There may be other mechanisms through which remittances enhance the prospects of democratization, particularly in dominant-party-regimes. However, these mechanisms are likely to strengthen our argument. For example, migrant diasporas directly influence political events in sending countries by disseminating information, framing political issues, financing candidates and parties, as well as by lobbying foreign governments and international organizations.</span> As O’Mahony (2013:805) notes, <span class='card-underline'>“[p]</span><span class='card-underline'>olitical</span><span class='card-underline'> contributions may be given directly to parties by migrants or passed on to politicians by migrants’ families.” Thus, remittances work in conjunction with migrant diasporas that help finance and mobilize domestic opposition groups.</span></p><p>The influence of augmented political resources for opposition mobilization should differ across autocratic contexts as well. Regular elections in dominant-partyregimes often pit legal opposition parties against the incumbent. The ruling party wins these elections because it enjoys resource advantages thanks to its monopoly access to public resources and state-controlled institutions such as the media (Magaloni 2006: Chapter 1; Greene 2007:5–6). Excluded from such resources, opposition parties benefit from foreign contributions, increasing their ability to compete for office, thus facilitating democratic transition. Hence, in dominant-party-regimes, remittances undermine the resource advantage ruling parties enjoy by providing opposition groups with funds they are unable to generate domestically.</p><p>For example, in Ethiopia, opposition parties that boycotted the 1995 and 2000 elections won 172 seats in the 2005 parliamentary election, while the ruling EPRDF retained “only” 327 seats—more than 150 fewer seats than it had won in the 2000 election. As Lyons (2007:540) emphasizes, “[t]he two main opposition coalitions that participated in the May 2005 elections had clear roots in the diasporas of North America and Europe.” In fact, most of the campaign funding for one of the main opposition coalition groups, the Coalition for Unity and Democracy, came from diaspora communities (Arriola 2008:120).</p><p><span class='card-underline'>In contrast, in regimes that are less likely to have regular and competitive mechanisms for leadership succession, remittances may simply increase the capacity of outside groups to forcibly oust the regime. In autocratic contexts where opposition groups and parties are banned, diaspora funds thus finance insurgencies</span> (Collier and Hoeffler 2004).17 <span class='card-underline'>While remittances in these cases may increase the prospects of a forced, or even violent, regime change, these regime ousters usually lead to a subsequent autocracy and not to democracy</span> (Geddes, Wright, and Frantz 2014b).</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Finally, emigration also fosters social learning by transmitting ideas and information about social norms, including democratic values, to those left behind</span> (Levitt 1998; Perez-Armendariz 2014). <span class='card-underline'>However, the social learning mechanism would operate provided emigrants settle in advanced, well-governed democracies, which is far from the rule in many developing countries</span> (World Bank 2011:12). <span class='card-underline'>Further, emigration—rather than economic remittances—should be a better measure of transferring values because migration is more likely to reflect political preferences as citizens leave when they dislike the state of political affairs at home</span> (Hiskey, Montalvo, and Orces 2014). Thus, their departure may decrease turnout for the incumbent (Pfutze 2014). Addressing the multiple mechanisms through which emigration may influence democratization requires timeseries data on emigration, but existing data are low quality, with poor coverage for most autocratic countries.18 Yet, we acknowledge that emigration can be a potentially confounding variable and show that the influence of remittances is robust to controlling for net migration, which is the best available measure given our research design.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Remittances vital to improving economic prospects and human capital development in Africa</div><div class='cite'>African Leadership 18 – (“Remittances: An Overlooked But Important Economic Driver in Africa”, African Leadership, http://africanleadership.co.uk/remittances-overlooked-important-economic-driver-africa/ // AA)</div><div class='card-body'><p>[chart omitted]</p><p>The forces of globalization and migration have become particularly potent on the global economic scene in the last two decades and they don’t appear to be slowing down.

The poorest 30% in Mexico, largely due to remittances, are approaching nationally average levels and spending 23% of household expenditures on food and 5% of household expenditures on clothing.7 This indicates that <span class='card-underline'>the poorest sectors of the population are shifting from subsistence to purchasing household goods. The increase in purchasing increases the demand for goods and services which, in turn, increases the portion of the population that actively participates as market consumers.</span> With an increase in poorer sectors of the population participating in market activity and consumption, demand for goods and services increases.

These increases in spending can often increase demand for non‐tradable goods, such as water and electricity, or goods that are not easily imported.  In developing countries, remittances are most often received by low and middle income people. These individuals are the most likely to increase their consumption in household items, transportation, communication and non‐tradable goods. Large increases in non‐tradable good demand can increase prices, as larger segments of the population either gain access to or increase their use of non‐tradable goods. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>This increase in prices creates upward pressure on the local currency and increases real exchange rates. This has the effect of increasing the competitiveness of foreign goods and increasing their consumption</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span><span class='card-underline'> Given that </span><span class='card-underline'>Mexico is a critical market for U.S. exports</span><span class='card-underline'>, this is great news for U.S. manufacturers.</span></p><p>Remittances may also change the type of consumption taking place.   High income earners in developing markets already have access to non‐tradable goods.

In an immediate sense, this appears reasonable because there is a direct link between organized crime and terrorism: most terrorist acts are themselves crimes (Dandurand and Chin 2004).

This result is not particularly surprising given the contradictory evidence from various empirical studies. On the one hand, the study by Lopez, et al. (2007), who analysed a panel of 20 countries from 1990 to 2003, seemed to confirm that real exchange rates appreciated due to remittance inflows and, as a result, widened the current account deficit; thus suggesting that remittances may have been a cause of Dutch disease. Similar results were found by Amuedo-Dorantes and Pozo (2004) for 13 Latin American and Caribbean countries, Lartey et al. (2012) in their a sample of 109 countries between 1992 and 2003, as well as Gazi, Hassan and Holmes (2013), who report a long run relationship between remittance inflows and Dutch disease. Conversely, the findings of others studies are consistent with this study: i.e. that the impact of remittances on exchange rates is generally weak and not statisically significant. Barajas et al. (2010) reported that <span class='card-underline'>countries tend to offset exchange rate appreciation and Dutch disease due to remittances by having relatively flexible labor markets</span> (to reduce resource movement effects), <span class='card-underline'>more open economies and higher volumes of trade</span>. A study in South African by Gossel and Biekpe (2012) did not find that remittances appreciated the rand. <span class='card-underline'>The main culprit of exchange rate appreciation</span>, they argued, <span class='card-underline'>was private investment portfolios. </span>This was confirmed by Combes, et al. (2011) who found that portfolio inflows were the most volatile, and had a greater effect on real exchange rate appreciation than either FDI or bank loans. <span class='card-underline'>Remittances contributed the least to rising real exchange rates.</span> Similarly, Ben <span class='card-underline'>Naceur</span><span class='card-underline'>,</span> Bakardzhieva and Kamar (2012) <span class='card-underline'>found that portfolio investment, foreign borrowing, and aid all resulted in some degree of real exchange rate appreciation, while remittances showed not clear pattern of exchange rate appreciation</span>.</p><p>The somewhat trite conclusion is that these contradictory findings are probably due to a host of factors operating on economies at different stages of development. These broadly include the amount of remittances (as a percentage of GDP), the flexibility of labor markets, the depth of financial markets, patterns of consumption and investment, and the extent of an economy’s openness and level of trade. Other factors are also at play. Exchange rate appreciation from capital inflows may also depend on the business cycle and the level of excess capacity within a developing economy. The greater the excess capacity the more an economy can absorb remittances without adding inflationary pressures and seeing the currency appreciate. This would apply especially when remittances substitute for deficits on the balance of trade on the current account. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Another factor that probably mitigates exchange rate appreciation is the tendency – unlike portfolio inflows – of </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>remittances to rise gradually, allowing the economy to adjust over time</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> without triggering macro-economic instability</span></span> or exchange rate appreciation.

Indeed Homo Sacer offers itself as a supplement to Foucault, arguing the need to complete his inquiry into the grand renfermement of hospitals and prisons that, for Agamben, should have culminated in those exemplary places of modern biopolitics, the concentration camp and the totalitarian state.45 Even Edward Said’s Orientalism, that founding text of postcolonial studies, is also very consciously a supplement to Foucault’s analysis of the operation of power from the late eighteenth to the mid-twentieth century. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Foucault’s neglect of the colonial dimension of</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span>his archaeology of <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>modernity</span></span>, however<span class='card-underline'>, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>cannot simply be compensated</span></span><span class='card-underline'> by inference or supplement</span>. <span class='card-underline'>The difficulties</span> it <span class='card-underline'>presents run much deeper</span>, as Ann Laura Stoler has shown.46 This is a matter I shall return to later. <span class='card-underline'>The Foucauldian tradition</span> <span class='card-underline'>can</span> also too readily see renfermement wherever it looks, while forgetting the paradoxical ways in which Foucault understood power as having operated through this period and into our own. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Tempting as it is to exploit the ease with which ‘the leper’ so readily becomes the ideal type of concepts such as Kristeva’s abjection and Agamben’s bare life, the reality for lepers in the modern period was often more complex</span></span>. As we shall see, mid-nineteenthcentury <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>metropolitan medicine resisted the idea that lepers should be isolated and lose their human </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>rights</span></span>, and was supported in this by British governments of the time. Agamben argues that within the biopolitical horizon that characterizes modernity, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the physician and the scientist supervise the camps of bare life</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, </span>47 <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>but the integration of medicine with politics he is indicating was also resisted by liberal medicine for much of the nineteenth century</span></span>. And <span class='card-underline'>in the eyes of the missionary sent out to run a leper colony</span>, <span class='card-underline'>Agamben’s space of exception was the ante-room to a place of especial privilege with God</span>. In other words, for much of the nineteenth century <span class='card-highlight'>‘</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the leper’ was less an emblem of bare life than a contested prototype of an emergent biopolitics</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> My aim is to historicise the processes that Foucauldian cultural history and theory conceptualise, and to suggest <span class='card-underline'>they were not always as totalitarian and clear-cut as Gilroy and Agamben, for </span><span class='card-underline'>example</span><span class='card-underline'>, assume.</span> <span class='card-underline'>Reading back from the Nazi concentration camps</span> <span class='card-underline'>into the nineteenth century can imply a more lethal biopolitics than is always strictly justified.</span> This is not to deny many of the lines of continuity that Gilroy and Agamben trace, but to suggest a more conflicted genealogy and a more nuanced history. This argument will be picked up in later chapters. These matters have a particular bearing on the kind of medico-cultural history I am attempting. Foucault’s explorations of marginality have had a special appeal for interdisciplinary scholars, particularly for those practising history at its boundaries whose infringements have often been resisted by academic historians.48 There has been closely related border tension around the fringes of the history of medicine. This has been well discussed by Roger Cooter, who describes how on the one hand the historian of medicine has concentrated on the historical context of biomedical knowledge and practice, while, on the other, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the literary-somatic turn in cultural studies has resulted in the appropriation of the body</span></span><span class='card-underline'> as a crucial element in the attempt at writing a conceptual history of modernity</span>.49 In a less polarised summary of this field he describes ‘an intellectually and methodologically motley traffic of social, literary and cultural historians and critics pursuing, and ...reproblematising, the politics of the body and its representations’.50 Despite his relative even-handedness, <span class='card-underline'>Cooter</span>, a historian of medicine himself, <span class='card-underline'>is critical of the ‘historical emptiness’</span> he discerns <span class='card-underline'>in much literary-cultural ‘body-work’</span>: ‘<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>One ends up with</span></span> myriad <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>revelations</span></span><span class='card-underline'> well described and often arresting</span>, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>but no explanation</span></span><span class='card-underline'> either </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>of the genesis or</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> the </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>context in which particular discourses are sustained</span></span>. Aesthetics prevail.’ And as he puts it more acerbically, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>by exceptionalising and homogenising biomedicine</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>these ‘literary champions of the </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>discursive’ produce ‘fictitious</span></span><span class='card-underline'> (if critically convenient) </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>harmonious translations ... between alleged social and scientific domains’</span></span>.51 </p><p>These strictures are not unfair. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The somatic turn</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> in Foucauldian-influenced</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>literary and cultural <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>studies</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>has resulted in some facile analogies between the medical, the social and the ideological</span></span>, the<span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>product of free-floating metaphor rather than materially grounded history</span></span><span class='card-underline'>; </span><span class='card-underline'>whereas some recent medical history of more conventional-seeming appearance has found ways of avoiding the narrative of progress that the history of medicine has often found difficult to escape,</span> and employed versions of the indeterminacy favoured in theory, if not always in practice, by literary somaticians. One such is Michael Worboys’ Spreading Germs (2000), which demonstrates that the concept of ‘germs’ lacked any fixity of meaning in the period leading up to the development of bacteriology, and that even after this there was no ‘single bacterial model for germs or their actions in any branch of the profession’.52 Worboys’ scrupulous investigation of germ ideas and practices in the second half of the nineteenth century should be an important check on metaphorically inclined cultural critics who see infection, contagion and invasion wherever they look. Only in the 1890s, Worboys argues, was the ‘military analogy of invading germs in conflict with the body’s defences’ becoming widely used.53 Yet a history such as Worboys’ is confined to the medical profession and its local cultures, and there is every reason for historians and others of a more broadly cultural inclination to examine the ubiquity of disease and infection language in this period and beyond. The task should be to try and bring these different worlds into more considered relation with each other. </p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Don’t buy their totalizing claims – metaphors of leprosy  assume a single disease that caused exlcusoion—their analysis is based on the flawed assumptions of the nature of leprosy. </div><div class='cite'>Edmond 6 (Rod Edmond, July 2006, Professor of Modern Literature and Cultural History at University of Kent, United Kingdom, “Leprosy and Empire: A Medical and Cultural History”, Cambridge University Press, https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511497285, pages 5-6) //SJK</div><div class='card-body'><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Already there are problems</span></span> with my discussion<span class='card-underline'>. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Does the leprosy of Leviticus</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, of fourteenth-century </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>France and</span></span><span class='card-underline'> twentieth-century </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Hawaii</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>describe the same clinical entity</span></span><span class='card-underline'>?</span> <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>And does the concern of</span></span><span class='card-underline'> the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Leviticus</span></span><span class='card-underline'> writer, the panic of late medieval southern </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>French society</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>and</span></span><span class='card-underline'> the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>fear of the anti-communist</span></span><span class='card-underline'> investigator </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>derive from some common transhistorical</span></span><span class='card-underline'> Judeo-Christian </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>revulsion at the disease</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>or does each</span></span><span class='card-underline'> of these instances </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>have a historical specificity that makes it </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>misleading</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> to run them together</span></span><span class='card-underline'> in the way that I have so far been doing?</span> <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The</span></span><span class='card-underline'> simple </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>answer to the first of these questions is almost certainly not</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span><span class='card-underline'> </span>Even within the Bible, <span class='card-underline'>the symptoms of </span>leprosy in Leviticus <span class='card-underline'>are different</span>, for example<span class='card-underline'>, from those described by Aaron</span> in Numbers. <span class='card-underline'>The Leviticus</span> writer<span class='card-underline'> is concerned with blemishes of the skin</span>, and there is no equivalent of the account in Numbers, which describes it as a condition in which the flesh is ‘half consumed’ (12: 12). Mary Douglas argues that Leviticus’s description suggests not one but various skin diseases, including skin cancer, psoriasis, tropical ulcers, yaws, and major infectious diseases such as smallpox or measles.14 <span class='card-underline'>In medieval and early modern Europe </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>leprosy was very often a generic term</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>for a wide range of skin diseases</span></span> and, clinically speaking, it is only in the early nineteenth century that a sustained attempt was begun to distinguish leprosy from other skin disorders, and to distinguish between different types of leprosy itself. That said, the <span class='card-underline'>Leviticus writer is obsessively concerned with establishing ‘true leprosy’ and with distinguishing it</span> fromothersuperficiallysimilardiseases.Andforallthatleprosycontinued to be run together with other skin diseases, it was also imperative to differentiate a disease that was believed to be highly contagious and whose consequences for the sufferer were so serious. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Accurate</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>diagnosis was</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, on the one hand, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>impossible, and</span></span><span class='card-underline'> on the other, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>essential</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> Versions of this dilemma haunted the disease until well into the twentieth century. Does a constant set of causes underlie the apparent continuity of response to leprosy since biblical times? For a medical scientist such as Olaf K. Skinsnes, leprosy is a disease with a unique medical pathology that produces a unique social response; a constant set of causes results in an identical stigma wherever the disease appears.15 And a literary critic like Nathaniel Brady also sees the resurfacing of fears about leprosy in Europe in the nineteenth century, after centuries during which the disease had virtually disappeared, as testimony to its constant power as an emblem of sin and moral decay.16 For Zachary Gussow, however, to regard the reaction to leprosy as a psychological and cultural constant is to augment the very process being described and to endorse the idea of the long unchanging history of leprosy’s taint; ‘[h]umanity’s dread is termed a natural response’, and leprosy becomes perpetually identified with stigma. Biblical tradition and the literary imagination, he suggests, have been particularly important in sustaining this account of the history of the disease.17 Gussow himself denies the universality of both the response and its causes, arguing that leprosy was ‘retainted’ in the modern colonial period; around the turn of the twentieth century it was transformed from ‘a feared clinical entity’ into ‘a stigmatised phenomenon’.18 He sees a number of interlocking reasons for this: the discovery of the leprosy bacillus in 1874 which offered scientific support for those who argued the disease was contagious rather than hereditary; the belief that leprosy was racially selective, and had become a tropical rather than a European disease; the movement of indentured labour around the world following the abolition of slavery, and consequent fear of the disease spreading; and the organised involvement of Western missionaries in leprosy work in the wake of the expansion of European empires.19 This approach is clearly more satisfactory than trans-historical and trans-cultural explanations that see the fear of leprosy as constant and unchanging. <span class='card-underline'>The idea of ‘retainting’ also fits the sequence proposed by Foucault in which leprosy disappeared from the Western world at the end of the Middle Ages, with criminals and the insane taking the part previously played by the leper</span>.20 Gussow builds on some of the possibilities opened up by Foucault’s argument.21 There are, however, significant differences between the two. <span class='card-underline'>Gussow treats modern leprosy almost as if it were a new diseas</span>e, although he declines to be drawn into the question of the continuity or otherwise of biblical and medieval leprosy with its modern forms.22 In terms of its stigmatisation <span class='card-underline'>he insistently emphasises discontinuity</span>: ‘It is unnecessary to search the human psyche deeply or to reach far back into history to account for modern lepraphobia. A close look at the expanding Western world during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries suffices.’23</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>The metaphor of the Panopticon is no longer applicable – we live in the era of post-panopticism</div><div class='cite'>Boyne 2000 (Roy Boyne is the Emeritus Professor in the Department of Sociology at Durham College, “Post-Panopticism,” https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/030851400360505 ///ghs-sc)</div><div class='card-body'><p>According to Zygmunt Bauman’s analysis, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the ‘“Panoptic” model</span></span><span class='card-underline'> of securing</span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>and perpetuating social order’ </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is now defunct</span></span>.

He writes: Most of us are socially and culturally trained and shaped as sensation-seekers and gatherers, rather than producers and soldiers. Constant openness for new sensations and greed for ever new experience, always stronger and deeper than before, is a condition sine qua non of being amenable to seduction. It is not ‘health’ with its connotation of a steady state, of an immobile target on which all properly trained bodies converge – but ‘fitness’, implying being always on the move or ready to move, capacity for imbibing and digesting ever-greater volumes of stimuli, exibility and resistance to all closure, that grasps the quality expected from the experience-collector, the quality that indeed she or he must possess to seek and absorb sensations.

Bauman’s analysis is persuasive inside those areas of contemporary society where hunger for movement is, oxymoronically, a required luxury. His analysis is, however, just a little too deeply impressed by a tendency which can also be seen, mutatis mutandis, in the work of Pierre Bourdieu, a tendency slightly to over-generalize the condition of what Bourdieu called the ‘fun ethic’ of the ‘rising petit-bourgeoisie’ (Bourdieu 1984: 365–71). Memorably, Bauman has written of ‘tourists and vagabonds’, ‘globals and locals’, inhabitants of a new st and a new second world: For the inhabitants of the rst world – the increasingly cosmopolitan, extraterritorial world of global businessmen, global culture managers or global academics, state borders are levelled down, as they are dismantled for the world’s commodities, capital and nances. For the inhabitant of the second world, the walls built of immigration controls, of residence laws, and of ‘clean streets’ and ‘zero tolerance’ policies, grow taller; the moats separating them from the sites of their desire and of dreamed-of redemption grow deeper, while all bridges, at the rst attempt to cross them, prove to be drawbridges. (Bauman 1998: 89) In Bauman’s view, in the hydraulic era of mass armies and huge workforces, the Panopticon could quite properly be seen as a ‘diagram of a mechanism of power reduced to its ideal form’ (Foucault 1979: 205), as the conceptual essence of interior regulation.

It ‘had been seen by very few; most of the medical men even had not read it ...It seemed as if not above two or three copies had ever reached each colony; in more than one, the Government offices were without a copy.’7 Milroy’s task now became one of spreading the word according to the College of Physicians to a superstitious and incredulous colonial world. Throughout his tour he drummed home the message that leprosy was hereditary and not contagious, and therefore that strict isolation was unwarranted and the neglect of patients inhumane. He wanted lepers to be treated alongside other chronically ill patients, and for the ‘leprosy’ label to be dropped from the title of institutions:</p><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>As long as</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> the terms ‘leper’, ‘leprosy’, are continually being repeated, it will be very difficult to disabuse the public mind of the dread and aversion which the words have hitherto suggested.

As I said, this title has two clear meanings, which endorse each other and reflect the character of the narrative. (The story, I should say, concerns the courage of a young woman in the face of certain death.) These two meanings are genuine meanings; they are not private associations. Derrida associates the title with a third idea that is, I think, absolutely foreign to it, the idea of a ridge or backbone — arête, in French. He then looks for this ridge in the story. It is not described there: it would add nothing to the meaning if it were. (The word arête is normally used in common speech when cooking or eating fish.) So Derrida concludes that the ridge must be concealed in the structure of the story. It is this structural ridge which is of supreme importance, and which provides the point of departure for the impossible task of reading. There is no admissible distinction between meaning and association, and so nothing that we could say to suggest that he is straying from the point.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Such </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>sideways slithering through associated ideas is</span></span><span class='card-underline'> in fact wholly </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>characteristic of deconstructive criticism</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>which treats the text as a pretext, and speaks a private ‘metalanguage’ of its own</span></span>.

It is this conceptual density that gets trafﬁcked into, unknowingly perhaps, the debates about free blacks in antebellum society. The epigraph raises these concerns, without explicitly making bare the existential presumptions about blackness that anchor it. For J.C. Calhoun, freedom for blackness is death, a form of death worse than mere biological expiration—mental death, or insanity[irrationality]. Since the human-being names a relationship of care between the “self, ” Being, and its projection into the external world(freedom), claiming that the black is incapable of such care places him[them] outside the realm of freedom and into the domain of the unfree, the care-less, and the unthought. But this realm of unfreedom is also a form of “death,” according to Orlando Patterson, because <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>anti-blackness strips the captive of this fundamental existential relationship by objectifying this “self”</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and presenting this relationship to the captor for his pleasure.</span> Thus, <span class='card-underline'>we have a strange play between deaths, deaths reconﬁgured as life, which seems to be the only existential option for blackness in modernity:</span> <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>freedom engenders mental death and unfreedom engenders social death</span></span>.

The same [Mexican] underclass has migrated north to find jobs on the border, bringing the parasite and the sickness—cysticercosis—its eggs can cause[.] Cysts that form around the larvae usually lodge in the brain and destroy tissue, causing hallucinations, speech and vision problems, severe headaches, strokes, epileptic seizures, and in rare cases death.”3 <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The problem</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, however, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is not confined to the border</span></span><span class='card-underline'> region, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>as</span></span><span class='card-underline'> illegal </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>immigrants have rapidly spread across the country</span></span><span class='card-underline'> into many new economic sectors such as food processing, construction, and hospitality services. </span>Typhoid struck Silver Spring, Maryland, in 1992 when an immigrant from the Third World (who had been working in food service in the United States for almost two years) transmitted the bacteria through food at the McDonald’s where she worked.

Approximately 500,000 legal immigrants and 80,000 refugees come to the United States each year, and an additional 700,000 illegal immigrants enter annually, and three-quarters of these illegal immigrants come from Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Legal immigrants</span></span> and refugees <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>are required to have a medical examination for migration</span></span><span class='card-underline'> to the United States</span>, while they are still overseas. This is the responsibility of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which provide instructions to the Panel Physicians who conduct the medical exams. The procedure consists of a physical examination, an evaluation (skin test/chest x-ray examination) for tuberculosis (TB), and blood test for syphilis. Requirements for vaccination are based on recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Individuals who fail the exam</span></span><span class='card-underline'> due to certain health-related conditions </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>are not admitted to the Uni</span></span><span class='card-underline'>ted </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>S</span></span><span class='card-underline'>tates. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Such conditions include</span></span> drug addiction or communicable diseases of public health significance such as TB, syphilis, gonorrhoea, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>leprosy</span></span>, and a changing list of current threats such as polio, cholera, diphtheria, smallpox, or severe acute respiratory syndromes. Illegal immigrants crossing into the United States could bring any of these threats, however. Southern Texas Border Patrol agent Chris Cabrera warns: "What's coming over into the US could harm everyone. We are starting to see scabies, chicken pox, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections, and different viruses." Illegal <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>immigration may expose Americans to diseases that have been</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>virtually eradicated, but are highly contagious</span></span>, as in the case of TB. This disease rose by 20% globally from 1985 to 1991, and was declared a worldwide emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1995. Furthermore, TB frequently occurs in connection with the human immunodeficiency virus. Fortunately, more than 90% of Central Americans are vaccinated against TB, according to the WHO. The federal government's Department of Homeland Security has public health controls in place to minimize any possible health risks, including medical units at the busiest border stations and measures to protect Customs and Border Protection including gloves, long-sleeve shirts, and frequent hand washing. In addition, the CDC’s Division of Global Migration and Quarantine has measures in place to protect the population from communicable diseases. The agency works through a variety of activities to prevent the introduction, transmission, and spread of communicable diseases in the United States. It operates Quarantine Stations at ports of entry; establishes standards for medical examination of persons headed legally for the United States; and administers interstate and foreign quarantine regulations governing the international and interstate movement of humans, animals, and cargo. The agency also alerts state authorities of newly arrived immigrants with certain health conditions. The CDC's Epidemiology Team also monitors infectious diseases among immigrants and refugees with their disease surveillance systems, investigations of disease outbreaks, and their Migrant Serum Bank of anonymous immigrant and refugee blood samples available for research. Other branches of the CDC protect US health through ensuring the quality of overseas medical exams required of immigrants and refugees. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Concerns have been</span></span><span class='card-underline'> specifically </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>raised about children, due to the risk of infections spreading in</span></span><span class='card-underline'> public </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>schools</span></span>. But the CDC currently believes that the children arriving at US borders "pose little risk of spreading infectious diseases to the general public." The CDC also confirms that vaccinations are provided to all children who do not have valid documentation. All children are initially screened for visible and obvious health issues (for example, lice, rashes, diarrhea, and cough) when they first arrive at Customs and Border Protection facilities.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Although public charge applies to some nonimmigrants, plan is written to only apply to legal permanent residents, AND nonimmigrants can normally overcome the public charge issue- no significant solvency deficit.</div><div class='cite'>National Immigration Law Center(NILC), 2018 [“Changes to ‘Public Charge’ Instructions in the U.S. State Department's Manual.” National Immigration Law Center, National Immigration Law Center, 8 Feb. 2018, <span class='card-underline'>www.nilc.org/issues/economic-support/public-charge-changes-to-fam/</span>, AM]</div><div class='card-body'><p><span class='card-underline'>Since the first weeks of the Trump administration</span>, when a draft executive order about immigrants and public benefits was leaked to the media, <span class='card-underline'>concerns about changes to “public charge” policies have caused considerable anxiety.</span> On January 3, 2018, <span class='card-underline'>the U.S. Department of State published revised sections of its Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM) that deal with “public charge.” These State Department instructions underscore the administration’s interest in restricting family immigration and deterring families from securing critical services.</span></p><p>Some <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>non–U.S. citizens who seek to enter the U.S. or who seek lawful permanent resident, or LPR, status must show that they are not likely to become dependent on the government for cash assistance or long-term </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>care</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Certain</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> immigrants</span></span><span class='card-underline'> — including refugees; asylees; survivors of trafficking, domestic violence and other serious crimes; and other “humanitarian” immigrants </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>are not subject to this public charge test</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span></p><p>The <span class='card-underline'>FAM provides instructions</span> that <span class='card-underline'>officials in U.S. embassies and consulates abroad use to make decisions about whether to grant a person permission to enter the U.S. as an immigrant or on a nonimmigrant visa.</span> It does not govern decisions made by immigration officials inside the U.S. However, the FAM revision foreshadows other changes that we may see this year.</p><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Federal law allows immigration authorities to deny entry to the U.S. to non–U.S. citizens who are likely in the future to depend on the governmen</span></span><span class='card-underline'>t for subsistence by relying on cash assistance or long-term care at government expense (i.e., people who are likely to become a public charge).</span> In making a public charge determination, the government must look at a person’s age, health, family situation, income, resources, education, and skills, and may also consider an affidavit of support or contract signed by a sponsor promising to support the immigrant.

CSIS published their report on HIV/AIDS and immigration in March 2007,4 which outlined the flaws and highlighted the contradiction of the ban with the global efforts of the United States in the HIV/AIDS epidemic. CSIS called for a change in the law, either to change the language of the INA to allow for removal of the HIV ban or to broaden the availability of waivers.4 In July 2008, with the renewal of PEPFAR funding, Congress removed the phrase ‘‘which shall include infection with the etiologic agent for acquired immune deficiency syndrome,’’ from the INA.2 This allowed the DHHS to reclaim authority to independently determine the definition of a “communicable disease of public health significance.” The following year, <span class='card-underline'>under</span> the new <span class='card-underline'>Obama</span> administration, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>DHHS proposed a rule removing HIV from the list of inadmissible infections and with it, removing HIV testing from the scope of required immigrations examinations</span></span>.

While Mr. Trump cannot claim all the credit for this, the recent Republican tax cut is likely to be seen as a positive contribution to general prosperity despite its adding to long-term fiscal deficits.

It is important for research to examine more closely whether risk for bias victimization is worse for certain groups of youth, in different contexts, and how that risk is changing over time. <span class='card-underline'>For example, although we did not find African-American youth to be at heightened risk for bias-based victimization in our national survey, as noted above, there may be particular communities in which their risk is higher.</span> Additionally, there may be trends in understudied subgroups of youth who may not have been a significant focus of previous research. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Immigrant youth and Islamic youth may be seeing heightened bias victimization in recent years, as political and cultural climates change</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> In general, ongoing research is needed measuring how risk for bias-based victimization for different vulnerable youth vary by local contexts (e.g., school and neighborhood climate and demographic make-up), and as a result of shifts in larger cultural and political contexts. Research is also needed to help understand how to prevent the perpetration of bias-based peer harassment and other bias victimization. For example, research is needed to understand which youth are more likely to perpetrate bias-based harassment. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Research has already identified links between early homophobic name calling behavior and later sexual harassment perpetration</span></span><span class='card-underline'> (Espelage et al., 2017).</span> Similarly, future research might examine whether early bias-based harassment is linked to later perpetration of more serious bias-based assaults and hate crimes. There also may be protective factors across ecological levels that, if better understood, could provide clues to developing preventive interventions to reduce victimization, or negative impact on victims (Hong & Espelage, 2012). <span class='card-underline'>Parent-child relationships, peer relationships, and peer group dynamics, for example, all may mediate the experience and impact of bias-based victimization.</span><span class='card-underline'> </span>For schools and policy-makers, the findings suggest the importance of expanding the focus on youth victimization beyond just bullying (Finkelhor, Shattuck, Turner, & Hamby, 2016). <span class='card-underline'>Bullying has received a lot of attention from researchers, school professionals and parents, but the current study suggests that bias-based harassment can also be distressing for youth.</span> <span class='card-underline'>An incident of harassment that includes bias language, may not necessarily meet the typical criteria for bullying (repeated aggression by a perpetrator who is more powerful than the victim) (Gladden et al., 2014; Olweus, 2007), and therefore could be dismissed by caregivers and school professionals. While the use of explicit racial slurs at school might attract adult intervention, many other bias-based harassment incidents may be dismissed as ‘common name-calling’</span>. Our data suggest that the use of bias language in a harassment incident should signal to caregivers and school professionals that careful follow-up is called for and intervention may be warranted. It is critical that schools work to prevent bias-based victimization through social-emotional learning programs and diversity and inclusiveness education. Researchers must help to identify educational programs and strategies that are most effective in reducing this kind of victimization. Additionally, schools can be proactive in identifying victims of bias-based harassment by asking questions about bias language during incident inquiries. <span class='card-underline'>If present, this and other research suggests that the youth may need additional emotional support and assistance.</span><span class='card-underline'> </span>Positively, there are indications that bias victimization may be declining at least for some types of victimization. The School Crime Survey finds rates of youth exposure to hate language have dropped from 12% in 2001 to 7% in 2015 (Zhang et al., 2016). Similarly, the 2015 National School Climate Survey found that the percentage of students hearing homophobic remarks dropped from over 80% in 2001 to less than 60% in 2015, although LGBTQ students reported a higher incidence of negative remarks about gender expression in 2015 compared to 2013 (Kosciw et al., 2016). This is encouraging but also emphasizes the importance of research that tracks youth experiences with bias victimization by asking detailed questions about multiple kinds of victimization experiences as part of national surveys. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Bias-based harassment victimization is a common occurrence for youth, with over one-half of harassment incidents containing bias language</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. Study findings indicate that such incidents are linked with elevated distress and negative social and school consequences for targeted youth</span>. Data show that these harassment incidents may not meet formal definitions of bullying, but nonetheless have significant negative impact on youth, suggesting that prevention and intervention policies need to incorporate these into bullying education efforts. <span class='card-underline'>Raising awareness, tracking youth bias victimization experiences across time and contexts, increasing education, and improving prevention strategies surrounding bias-involved victimization is crucial for ensuring the safety and wellbeing for youth.</span><span class='card-underline'> </span></p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Anti-immigrant messages affect families nationwide, making them to feel extremely unwelcome</div><div class='cite'>Jessic Weiss(International Women's Media Foundation Fellow), Six months of hate: how anti-immigrant sentiment is affecting Latinos in the United States, 14, June, 2017(JTR)</div><div class='card-body'><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Marvin del Cid wakes up to find the words "fu**ing Mexicans, get out" spray painted on the side of his trailer.</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>Dreamers Justino Mora, Iván Ceja and Belen Sisa endure weeks of threatening messages — and even death threats — online after posting on social media about being undocumented.</span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Kids plead with their parents not to send them to school after chants of "build the wall</span></span><span class='card-underline'>."</span><span class='card-underline'> </span>In recent months, hate incidents and hate crimes have targeted Latinos around the country, in small towns and big cities, coast-to-coast. Though the weeks immediately before and after the presidential election saw the most reports, incidents have continued at a steady tick. Since the presidential election, Univision has received nearly 200 reports of hate and bias perpetrated against our readers and viewers, sent to us through the Documenting Hate project. From those reports, we have interviewed dozens of Latinos who have been the victims of racist slurs and harassment, intimidation, vandalism and even assault. Here are some of the trends we've observed: "Go back to your country" <span class='card-underline'>"Send them back to their own f**king country," a woman is heard saying in the direction of a Hispanic family in a video recorded earlier this month at a Sears in New Jersey.

Unlike hard-power assets (such as armed forces), <span class='card-underline'>many soft-power resources are separate from the government and are only partly responsive to its purposes. In a liberal society, the absence of official cultural policies can itself be a source of attraction</span><span class='card-underline'>. Hollywood movies</span> like The Post, which showcase independent women and press freedom, <span class='card-underline'>can attract others. So, too, can the charitable work of US foundations or the benefits of freedom of inquiry at American universities.</span></p><p>It is true that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>firms, universities, foundations and other non-governmental groups develop soft power of their own</span></span> which may reinforce or be at odds with the US foreign policy goals. And <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>all of these private sources of soft power are likely to become increasingly important in the global information age</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> That is all the more reason for governments to make sure that their own actions and policies create and reinforce rather than undercut and squander their soft power.</p><p>Domestic or foreign <span class='card-underline'>policies that appear hypocritical</span>, arrogant, indifferent <span class='card-underline'>to others’ views, or based on a narrow conception of national interests can undermine soft power.</span> For example, the steep decline in the attractiveness of the US in opinion polls conducted after the invasion of Iraq in 2003 were a reaction to the George W. Bush administration and its policies, rather than to the US generally.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>The Iraq War was not the first government policy that made the US unpopular. In the 1970s, many people around the world objected to the US war in Vietnam, and America’s global standing reflected the unpopularity of that policy. When the policy changed and the memories of the war receded, the US recovered much of its lost soft power. Similarly, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>in the aftermath of the Iraq war, the US managed to recover much of its soft power in most regions of the world.</span></span></p><p>Sceptics might still argue that the rise and fall of American soft power does not matter much, because countries cooperate out of self-interest. But this argument misses a crucial point: <span class='card-underline'>Cooperation is a matter of degree, and the degree is affected by attraction or repulsion. Moreover, the effects of a country’s soft power extend to non-state actors</span> — for example, by aiding or impeding recruitment by terrorist organisations. In an information age, success depends not only on whose army wins, but also on whose story wins.</p><p><span class='card-underline'>One of the greatest sources of America’s soft power is the openness of its democratic processes. Even when mistaken policies reduce its attractiveness, America’s ability to criticise and correct its mistakes makes it attractive to others at a deeper level. When protesters overseas were marching against the Vietnam War, they often sang ‘We Shall Overcome’, the anthem of the US civil rights movement.</span></p><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>America, too, will almost certainly overcome.

Still, by far and away world history’s most extensive empire, the U.S. has at least 800 military bases spread across more than 80 foreign countries and “troops or other military personnel in about 160 foreign countries and territories.” The U.S. accounts for more than 40 percent of the planet’s military spending and has more than 5,500 strategic nuclear weapons, enough to blow the world up 5 to 50 times over. Last year it increased its “defense” (military empire) spending, which was already three times higher than China’s, and nine times higher than Russia’s.

A Pentagon study released last summer laments the emergence of a planet on which the U.S. no longer controls events. Titled “At Our Own Peril: DoD Risk Assessment in a Post-Primary World,” the study warns that competing powers “seek a new distribution of power and authority commensurate with their emergence as legitimate rivals to U.S. dominance” in an increasingly multipolar world. China, Russia and smaller players like Iran and North Korea have dared to “engage,” the Pentagon study reports, “in a deliberate program to demonstrate the limits of U.S. authority, reach influence and impact.” What chutzpah! This is a problem, the report argues, because the endangered U.S.-managed world order was “favorable” to the interests of U.S. and allied U.S. states and U.S.-based transnational corporations<span class='card-underline'>. Any serious efforts to redesign the international status quo so that it favors any other states or people is portrayed in the report as a threat to U.S. interests. </span>To prevent any terrible drifts of the world system away from U.S. control, the report argues, <span class='card-underline'>the U.S. and its imperial partners</span> (chiefly its European NATO partners) <span class='card-underline'>must maintain and expand “unimpeded access to the air, sea, space, cyberspace, and the electromagnetic spectrum in order to underwrite their security and prosperity.” </span>The report recommends a significant expansion of U.S. military power. <span class='card-underline'>The U.S. must maintain “military advantage” over all other states and actors to “preserve maximum freedom of action” and thereby “allow U.S. decision-makers the opportunity to dictate or hold significant sway over outcomes in international disputes,” with the “implied promise of unacceptable consequences” for those who defy U.S. wishes.</span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>“America First” is an understatement here. The underlying premise is that Uncle Sam owns the world and reserves the right to bomb the hell out of anyone who doesn’t agree with that</span> (to quote President George H.W. Bush after the first Gulf War in 1991: “What we say goes.” It’s nothing new. From the start, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the “American Century” had nothing to do with advancing democracy</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> As numerous key U.S. planning documents reveal over and over, the <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>goal of that policy was to maintain and</span></span>, if necessary, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>install governments that “favor[ed] private investment of domestic and foreign capital, production for export, and the right to bring profits out of the country</span></span><span class='card-underline'>,”</span> according to Noam Chomsky. Given the United States’ remarkable possession of half the world’s capital after World War II, <span class='card-underline'>Washington elites had no doubt that U.S. investors and corporations would profit the most. Internally, the basic selfish national and imperial objectives were openly and candidly discussed. </span>As the “liberal” and “dovish” imperialist, top State Department planner, and key Cold War architect George F. Kennan explained in “Policy Planning Study 23,” a critical 1948 document: We have about 50% of the world’s wealth, but only 6.3% of its population. … In this situation, we cannot fail to be the object of envy and resentment. Our real task in the coming period is to devise a pattern of relationships which will permit us to maintain this position of disparity. … To do so, we will have to dispense with all sentimentality and day-dreaming; and our attention will have to be concentrated everywhere on our immediate national objectives. … We should cease to talk about vague and … unreal objectives such as human rights, the raising of the living standards, and democratization. The day is not far off when we are going to have to deal in straight power concepts. The less we are then hampered by idealistic slogans, the better. <span class='card-underline'>The harsh necessity of abandoning “human rights” and other “sentimental” and “unreal objectives” was especially pressing in the global South</span>, what used to be known as the Third World. <span class='card-underline'>Washington assigned the vast “undeveloped” periphery of the world capitalist system—Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia and the energy-rich and thus strategically hyper-significant Middle East</span>—a less than flattering role. <span class='card-underline'>It was to “fulfill its major function as a source of raw materials and a market</span>” (actual State Department language) <span class='card-underline'>for the great industrial (capitalist) nations</span> (excluding socialist Russia and its satellites, and notwithstanding the recent epic racist-fascist rampages of industrial Germany and Japan). <span class='card-underline'>It was to be exploited both for the benefit of U.S. corporations/investors and for the reconstruction of Europe and Japan as prosperous U.S. trading and investment partners organized on capitalist principles and hostile to the Soviet bloc.</span><span class='card-underline'> </span>“Democracy” was fine as a slogan and benevolent, idealistic-sounding mission statement when it came to marketing this imperialist U.S. policy at home and abroad. Since most people in the “third” or “developing” world had no interest in neocolonial subordination to the rich nations and subscribed to what U.S. intelligence officials considered the heretical “idea that government has direct responsibility for the welfare of its people” (what U.S. planners called “communism”), Washington’s real-life commitment to popular governance abroad was strictly qualified, to say the least. “<span class='card-underline'>Democracy” was suitable to the U.S. as long as its outcomes comported with the interests of U.S. investors/corporations and related U.S. geopolitical objectives. It had to be abandoned, undermined and/or crushed when it threatened those investors/corporations and the broader imperatives of business rule to any significant degree.</span> As President Richard Nixon’s coldblooded national security adviser Henry Kissinger explained in June 1970, three years before the U.S. sponsored a bloody fascist coup that overthrew Chile’s democratically elected socialist president, Salvador Allende: “I don’t see why we need to stand by and watch a country go Communist because of the irresponsibility of its own people.” <span class='card-underline'>The U.S.-sponsored coup government</span> that murdered Allende <span class='card-underline'>would kill tens of thousands of real and alleged leftists with Washington’s approval</span>. The Yankee superpower sent some of its leading neoliberal economists and policy advisers to help the blood-soaked Pinochet regime turn Chile into a “free market” model and to help Chile write capitalist oligarchy into its national constitution. “Since 1945, by deed and by example,” the great Australian author, commentator and filmmaker John Pilger wrote nearly nine years ago: “<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The U.S. has overthrown 50 governments, including democracies, crushed some 30 liberation movements and supported tyrannies from Egypt to Guatemala</span></span> (see William Blum’s histories). <span class='card-underline'>Bombing is apple pie</span>.” Along the way, Washington has crassly interfered in elections in dozens of “sovereign” nations, something curious to note in light of current liberal U.S. outrage over real or alleged Russian interference in “our” supposedly democratic electoral process in 2016. Uncle Sam also has bombed civilians in 30 countries, attempted to assassinate foreign leaders and deployed chemical and biological weapons. </p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'><span class='card-highlight'>No impact to </span><span class='card-highlight'>heg</span><span class='card-highlight'> – exhaustive studies prove. </span><span class='card-highlight'> </span></div><div class='cite'><span class='card-highlight'>Fettweis</span> 20<span class='card-highlight'>11</span> [Christopher J.

In fact, the limited data we do have suggest the opposite may be true.</span> <span class='card-underline'>During the 1990s, the United States cut back on its defense spending fairly substantially. By 1998, the United States was spending $100 billion less on defense in real terms than it had in 1990</span>.51 <span class='card-underline'>To internationalists, defense hawks and believers in hegemonic stability, this irresponsible “peace dividend” endangered both national and global security.</span> “No serious analyst of American military capabilities,” argued Kristol and Kagan, “doubts that the defense budget has been cut much too far to meet America’s responsibilities to itself and to world peace.”52 On the other hand, <span class='card-underline'>if the pacific trends were not based upon U.S. hegemony but a strengthening norm against interstate war, one would not have expected an increase in global instability and violence.</span> <span class='card-underline'>The verdict from the past two decades is fairly plain: </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The world grew more peaceful while the United States cut its forces</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> No state seemed to believe that its security was endangered by a less-capable United States military, or at least none took any action that would suggest such a belief. <span class='card-underline'>No militaries were enhanced to address power vacuums, no security dilemmas drove insecurity or arms races, and no regional balancing occurred once the stabilizing presence of the U.S. military was diminished.</span> The rest of the world acted as if the threat of international war was not a pressing concern, despite the reduction in U.S. capabilities. Most of all, the United States and its allies were no less safe. The incidence and magnitude of global conflict declined while the United States cut its military spending under President Clinton, and kept declining as the Bush Administration ramped the spending back up<span class='card-underline'>. No complex statistical analysis should be necessary to reach the conclusion that the two are unrelated.</span><span class='card-underline'> </span>Military spending figures by themselves are insufficient to disprove a connection between overall U.S. actions and international stability. Once again, one could presumably argue that spending is not the only or even the best indication of hegemony, and that it is instead U.S. foreign political and security commitments that maintain stability. Since neither was significantly altered during this period, instability should not have been expected. Alternately, advocates of hegemonic stability could believe that relative rather than absolute spending is decisive in bringing peace. Although the United States cut back on its spending during the 1990s, its relative advantage never wavered. <span class='card-underline'>However, even if it is true that either U.S. commitments or relative spending account for global pacific trends, then at the very least stability can evidently be maintained at drastically lower levels of both. In other words, even if one can be allowed to argue in the alternative for a moment and suppose that there is in fact a level of engagement below which the United States cannot drop without increasing international disorder, a rational grand strategist would still recommend cutting back on engagement and spending until that</span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>level is determined.</span> Grand strategic decisions are never final; continual adjustments can and must be made as time goes on. Basic logic suggests that the United States ought to spend the minimum amount of its blood and treasure while seeking the maximum return on its investment. And if the current era of stability is as stable as many believe it to be, no increase in conflict would ever occur irrespective of U.S. spending, which would save untold trillions for an increasingly debt-ridden nation. It is also perhaps worth noting that if opposite trends had unfolded, if other states had reacted to news of cuts in U.S. defense spending with more aggressive or insecure behavior, then internationalists would surely argue that their expectations had been fulfilled. If increases in conflict would have been interpreted as proof of the wisdom of internationalist strategies, then logical consistency demands that the lack thereof should at least pose a problem. <span class='card-underline'>As it stands, the only evidence we have regarding the likely systemic reaction to a more restrained United States suggests that the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>current peaceful trends are unrelated to U.S. military</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>spending<span class='card-underline'>.

Steven Pinker's studies into the decline of violence reveal that deaths from war have fallen and fallen since World War II .</span> But we should not just assume that the past is an accurate guide to the future. Instead, <span class='card-underline'>we must look at the factors which have led to the reduction in war and try to conclude whether the decrease in war is sustainable.</span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>So what's changed? Well, the first big change after the last world war was the arrival of mutually assured destruction. It's no coincidence that the end of the last global war coincided with the </span><span class='card-underline'>invention of atomic weapons.</span> <span class='card-underline'>The possibility of complete annihilation provided a huge disincentive to launching and expanding total wars.</span> Instead, <span class='card-underline'>the great powers now fight proxy wars</span> like Vietnam and Afghanistan (the 1980 version, that is), ra<span class='card-underline'>ther than letting their </span><span class='card-underline'>rivalries expand into full-on, globe-spanning struggles against each other.</span> Sure, accidents could happen, but the possibility is incredibly remote. More importantly, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>nobody in power wants to be the cause of Armageddon</span></span>. But what about a non-nuclear global war? <span class='card-underline'>Other changes — economic and social in nature — have made that highly unlikely too. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The world has become much more economically interconnected since the last global war. Economic cooperation treaties and free trade agreements have intertwined the economies of countries around the world</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> This has meant there has been a huge rise in the volume of global trade since World War II, and especially since the 1980s. <span class='card-underline'>Today consumer goods like smartphones, laptops, cars, jewelery, food, cosmetics, and medicine are produced on a global level, with </span><span class='card-underline'>supply-chains criss-crossing the planet.</span><span class='card-underline'> </span>An example: The laptop I am typing this on is the cumulative culmination of thousands of hours of work, as well as resources and manufacturing processes across the globe. It incorporates metals like tellurium, indium, cobalt, gallium, and manganese mined in Africa. Neodymium mined in China. <span class='card-underline'>Plastics forged out of oil, perhaps from Saudi Arabia, or Russia, or Venezuela. Aluminum from bauxite, perhaps mined in Brazil. Iron, perhaps mined in Australia. These raw materials are turned into components — memory manufactured in Korea, semiconductors forged in Germany, glass made in the United States.</span> And it takes gallons and gallons of oil to ship all the resources and components back and forth around the world, until they are finally assembled in China, and shipped once again around the world to the consumer. <span class='card-underline'>In a global war, global trade becomes a nightmare. </span><span class='card-underline'>Shipping becomes more expensive due to higher insurance costs, and riskier because it's subject to seizures, blockades, ship sinkings. Many goods, intermediate components or resources — including energy supplies like coal and oil, components for military hardware, etc, may become temporarily unavailable in certain areas. Sometimes</span> — such as occurred in the Siege of Leningrad during World War II — the supply of food can be cut off. This is why countries hold strategic reserves of things like helium, pork, rare earth metals and oil, coal, and gas. <span class='card-underline'>These kinds of breakdowns were troublesome enough in the economic landscape of the early and mid-20th century, when the last global wars occurred. </span>But in today's ultra-globalized and ultra-specialized economy<span class='card-underline'>? The level of economic adaptation</span> — even for large countries like Russia and the United States with lots of land and natural resources — <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>required to adapt to a world war would be crushing, and huge numbers of business and livelihoods would be wiped out.

Furthermore, <span class='card-underline'>co</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>nditions in immigrant detention facilities have been widely criticised as violating international law</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Sexual minorities in detention often face social isolation, physical and sexual violence directed at them because of their gender identity, and harassment</span></span><span class='card-underline'> by both facility staff and other detainees</span>. In most prison settings, <span class='card-underline'>sexual minorities face </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>a heightened risk of targeted physical and sexual violence</span></span>. Transgender women1 are particularly vulnerable to this abuse because they are usually housed with men; <span class='card-underline'>in the US, for instance, they are thirteen times more likely to be sexually assaulted than other detainees. LGBTI </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>detainees are often placed in ‘administrative segregation’</span></span><span class='card-underline'> in response to complaints of sexual or physical violence or as a preventive measure</span>. Although segregation may seem to be the only available means of protecting sexual minority migrants from violence, in many detention centres it is indistinguishable from solitary confinement, involving confinement for 23 out of 24 hours a day in a tiny cell with extremely limited access to the outdoors, exercise or other people. This practice can lead to severe mental health after-effects and may exacerbate Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) or other conditions developed in response to violence in the country of origin or during migration. (<span class='card-underline'>In some cases, LGBTI detainees may selfisolate so as to avoid stigmatisation by refugees from their countries of origin</span>.) <span class='card-underline'>Such solitary confinement is </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>held by international human rights bodies as amounting to torture</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, inhuman or degrading treatment when it deprives detainees of meaningful access to detention centre services or, although it is widely termed ‘non-punitive isolation’, is tantamount to conditions of penal solitary confinement.</span> The medical needs of sexual minorities in detention, whether or not they require a regular regimen of HIV medication or hormone therapy, are rarely met. In many migrant detention facilities, only urgent medical care is provided; interpreters are rarely provided during medical procedures; there are insufficient private spaces for medical consultations; and medical expenses are borne by the detainees. LGBTI migrants in detention face significant risk of HIV infection and exposure to other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Some arrive in detention infected,</span></span><span class='card-underline'> often due to a history of sex work or exposure to sexual violence. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Others are infected in detention, where rates of</span></span><span class='card-underline'> HIV, AIDS and other </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>STIs tend to be higher</span></span><span class='card-underline'> than the rate in the general </span><span class='card-underline'>population. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Infection as a result of sexual violence in detention is of particular concern to transgender women, who are often housed with men</span></span>. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Detention also increases exposure to other infectious diseases, which heightens risk of HIV-related morbidity</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The lack of medical care available is also evidenced by the limited access of transgender detainees to hormone and other treatment associated with gender transition.</span></span><span class='card-underline'> In the US, however, according to recent guidelines, transgender immigrant detainees may receive hormone treatment but only if they were undergoing such treatment prior to being detained. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Transgender migrant detainees also report invasive and voyeuristic medical examinations</span></span><span class='card-underline'> by officials who are unfamiliar with their medical needs or have had little exposure to individuals with gender non-conforming identities. Sexual minority migrants, who experience high levels of physical and sexual violence in countries of origin, often suffer serious mental health after-effects. Detention conditions – including the loss of physical liberty (particularly when segregated), staff abuse, marginalisation by other detainees, lack of access to appropriate medical care, substandard hygiene, combined with the often indefinite nature of immigration detention – exacerbate mental illness.</span> Voyeuristic or offensive questioning of LGBTI migrants by migration authorities also detrimentally affects their mental health. <span class='card-underline'>Since </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>access to mental health counselling</span></span><span class='card-underline'> in migrant detention </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is extremely rare</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, sexual minorities not only suffer ongoing after-effects of harm experienced in countries of asylum but also are often retraumatised by experiences in detention. While LGBTI detainees – particularly those who are transgender – are often so visible in immigration detention systems that they are put at grave physical risk, they remain invisible where their protection concerns matter most: in the policies and guidelines that are designed to protect all detainees from harm and process migrants equitably and with dignity under international law.</span> The core elements of protection in human rights law that relate to detainees include the prohibition on torture, the prohibition on arbitrary detention, limits on detention time, non-discrimination clauses, and the right to liberty. Both the UN Human Rights Committee and the UN General Assembly have confirmed that these tenets of human rights law must be applied without discrimination to all peoples, including migrants. Other refugee-specific legal standards promulgated by UNHCR prohibit penalising migrants for illegal entry or presence, and assert that detention of asylum seekers should only be contemplated as a last resort. In October 2012, UNHCR issued new guidelines governing the detention of refugees. Intended as guidance to governments, legal practitioners, decision-makers and others, they provide valuable leadership on the special concerns of LGBTI asylum seekers in detention. Guideline 9.7 states that: Measures may need to be taken to ensure that any placement in detention of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or intersex asylum-seekers avoids exposing them to risk of violence, ill-treatment or physical, mental or sexual abuse; that they have access to appropriate medical care and counselling, where applicable; and that detention personnel and all other officials in the public and private sector who are engaged in detention facilities are trained and qualified, regarding international human rights standards and principles of equality and non-discrimination, including in relation to sexual orientation or gender identity. Where their security cannot be assured in detention, release or referral to alternatives to detention would need to be considered. In this regard, solitary confinement is not an appropriate way to manage or ensure the protection of such individuals.2 Although extremely welcome, UNHCR’s new <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Detention Guidelines alone are insufficient to address the severe problems</span></span><span class='card-underline'> that characterise the detention of sexual minority migrants</span>. Ultimately, <span class='card-underline'>states must provide alternatives to detention for all self-identifying sexual minorities – establishing non-custodial measures and alternative sentencing procedures.3 In addition, migrant detention facility staff and management must be trained on and sensitised to the protection needs of LGBTI migrants.

In articulating a demand to reverse cover, Soto Vega is not an outlier so much as the continuation of a disquieting trend in sexual-orientation-based asylum law. </span>The case employs elements of the reasoning used in the landmark decision Hernandez-Montiel v. INS, in which the Ninth Circuit distinguished between subsets of the Mexican homosexual population. 14 The court granted the asylum application of a man who began dressing and acting like a woman at age twelve.' 5 It characterized his "'particular social group'" as "[g]ay men with female sexual identities," which it called a "subset of the gay male population,"'16 and based its decision on the claim that female-acting homosexual men are subject to higher levels of abuse than male-acting homosexual men.' 7 The Ninth Circuit has since reconfirmed this reasoning, in Reyes-Reyes v. Ashcroft. 1 8 <span class='card-underline'>In granting asylum to an effeminate gay man precisely because he was so effeminate, the Hernandez-Montiel court rewarded reverse covering. Standing alone, that decision said nothing about gay men who did cover; effeminacy simply helped to articulate the social group narrowly.19 But when the IJ in Soto Vega actually punished covering, the other shoe dropped. Taken together, Hernandez-Montiel and Soto Vega suggest that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>courts perceive gay asylum applicants on a covering spectrum stretching from those who "act straight," or cover, to those who "act gay," or reverse cover</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. Grants of sexual-orientation-based asylum increasingly depend on where the applicant lies on this covering spectrum.</span> Soto Vega involved a gay man with a male sexual identity who was thus denied asylum. In Hernandez-Montiel and Reyes-Reyes, on the other hand, the applicants were effeminate, and so the courts looked on them more favorably.2 The rest of this Comment will argue that the covering-spectrum framework incorrectly assumes that homosexual men who cover are less vulnerable to persecution and unjustifiably treats gays who cover as a social group distinct from those who don't. The covering spectrum is fundamentally about visibility. Among asylum applicants, those who do not or cannot cover are more visibly gay, and are thus seen as more vulnerable to persecution and ultimately more deserving of asylum than those who cover. The visibility requirement is neither unique to asylum law21 nor, within it, to sexual-orientation-based asylum. Of the four enumerated grounds for asylum-race, nationality, religion, and political opinion22-the last two are likely to be invisible characteristics. Yet political asylum cases have considered it important that an individual was "a highly visible member" of the party or group whose opinions were disfavored.23 Similarly, for religious asylum, courts have considered whether the petitioner's religion can be "readily identified., 24 Importing this reasoiing to the ill-defined social group category, 2 courts have observed that, like "race, religion, nationality and political opinion[,] the attributes of a particular social group must be recognizable., 26 Visibility is not an independent requirement for asylum but a means of ascertaining whether persecution occurs "on account of" the protected characteristic.27 In asylum cases, a nexus must exist between an asylum applicant's persecution and his protected characteristic. To satisfy this requirement, courts have suggested that at a minimum, it is necessary that "the persecutor could become aware" of the protected characteristic. 28 Visibility is the most obvious and convenient way of showing that this possibility exists. Thus, in cases such as Reyes-Reyes, appearance becomes the requisite nexus between fear of persecution and homosexuality.29 It seems superficially reasonable to conclude that, for a gay individual who appears and acts heterosexual, sexuality will never trigger persecution. However, well-founded fear of persecution is the central inquiry in any asylum claim. Denying asylum to gays who cover overlooks the possibility that they hide their sexual identity out of fear of the persecution that would result if they did not. For many homosexuals, gay visibility is inversely related to fear; when fear increases, visibility decreases. 30 A study of homosexual persecution in Egypt documents how an increasing public awareness that "colored underwear, long hair, and tattoos were all telltale signs" of homosexuality led the gay community to avoid these things.31 In another case, fear of persecution led a homosexual couple in Bangladesh to "conduct[] themselves in a discreet manner," 32 because being conspicuous would lead to "the possibility of being bashed by the police. 33 In these cases, invisibility, not visibility, serves as a nexus between the individual's fear of persecution and his homosexuality.34 When covering is the result of fear,35 denial of asylum based even in part on gay visibility contravenes the central goal of asylum law. Sexualorientation-based asylum seeks to protect a person's right to be homosexual when threatened by fear of official persecution.36 If we accept that covering is burdensome for gay individuals, 37 any voluntary assumption of this burden is then arguably evidence that a well-founded fear exists. Covering motivated by fear-what I call "reactionary covering"-is, in fact, more than mere evidence of fear of persecution: It constitutes persecution. Although the cases discussed thus far have dealt with "gay" traits (such as effeminate dress or bearing), "gay" acts (such as homosexual sex) can also reveal one's sexual orientation. As a result, covering can lead to the avoidance of all emotional and physical contact with the same sex, both public and private. When fear forces a gay individual to live like a straight one, covering approaches outright conversion, which has been seen by American courts as persecution that meets the fear-based standard.38 The High Court of Australia has taken the next logical step and recognized reactionary covering as grounds for granting asylum. 39 Treating covering as grounds to deny asylum, as in Soto Vega, is a troubling anomaly that needs to be undone. That the visibility requirement for sexual-orientation-based asylum overlooks the possibility of reactionary covering is reason enough to abandon it. More fundamentally, however, the problem with the visibility requirement is that it conceptualizes homosexual identity in a way that is inconsistent with the immutability element of asylum law. In Soto Vega and other cases that apply the covering spectrum, judges assume that sexual orientation is expressed through action-through the doing of all those "stereotypical things that society assesses to gays. 4 ° In placing applicants along a covering spectrum, the absence of gay behavior becomes indicative of a fundamental difference in gay identity. Within the framework of asylum law, however, one is either gay or not. Homosexuality is not treated as a behavior that is subject to gradations, but as an immutable trait. Several circuits, along with the BIA, have held that an immutable characteristic is sufficient to establish a particular social group.41 It is on this basis that homosexuals are recognized as a particular social group: homosexuality is immutable.42 An immutability-based legal standard for those persecuted on the basis of their sexual orientation must recognize that while some gay people are capable of resisting any expression of that orientation, they are still gay and not necessarily immune from fear of persecution. While the link between action and identity has been emphasized in other contexts,43 it has no place in sexual-orientation-based asylum. A "performative model"' 4 4 of identity would suggest that someone cannot be eligible for asylum on the grounds of sexual orientation unless he manifests his orientation through his appearance or behavior. This is not how homosexuality has been treated in asylum law. In In re Acosta, the BIA defined an immutable characteristic as one that individuals "either cannot change, or should not be required to change. 45 It is their core sexual identity, separate from action, that immigration courts have long recognized the inability of gay men to change.46 When courts deny asylum to gay individuals who do not act gay, using a performative model, they wrongly assume that homosexual identity is constituted by action.47 When gender-conforming homosexuals are less intensely persecuted in a specific country, it does not negate the fact that they are fundamentally persecuted for their homosexuality. 48 Crucially, immutable homosexual identity is distinct from social perception of what is "gay." A performative model contravenes the immutability standard because it relies on variable social and cultural perceptions 49 of what actions characterize homosexuality. American courts, driven by the immutability requirement, should focus on that which is temporally and culturally constant-an applicant's core homosexual identity. The sexual identity that asylum law seeks to protect is unchanged by covering and unrelated to visibility. </p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Detention centers break rules to abuse LGBTQ folks – no solvency and turn </div><div class='cite'>Gruberg 18</div><div class='card-body'><p>5-30-18 Sharita Gruberg is the associate director of the LGBT Research and Communications Project at the Center for American Progress. “ICE’s Rejection of Its Own Rules Is Placing LGBT Immigrants at Severe Risk of Sexual Abuse” https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/news/2018/05/30/451294/ices-rejection-rules-placing-lgbt-immigrants-severe-risk-sexual-abuse/</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Laura Monterrosa is a queer asylum seeker from El Salvador. After being targeted by homophobic gang violence and having her life threatened, she decided to seek safety in the United States. In May 2017, she presented herself at the border, seeking asylum, and was detained at the T. Don Hutto detention center, an all-women immigration detention facility run by the private prison company CoreCivic. In November, she reported to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that a guard had sexually abused her on multiple occasions. After ICE’s Office of Professional Responsibility and the local sheriff’s office looked into the allegations, ICE closed her case, saying that her account “could not be corroborated” and “lacked evidence to pursue any further action.”</span> Laura’s attorney reported investigators even asked if the relationship with the guard was consensual. After ICE closed the case, the FBI intervened and picked up the investigation. Despite a pending FBI investigation into these incidents, ICE would not release Laura—nor would it fire the guard. Laura remained trapped inside Hutto with her alleged abuser. Desperate, Laura ingested 51 prescription pain pills in an attempt to kill herself. In February 2018, ICE reportedly placed her in isolation for three days, during which time she claimed ICE tried to get her to recant her accusation of sexual abuse. A month later, Laura was finally released from detention after a judge ordered ICE to provide mental health care outside the detention facility. <span class='card-underline'>The Center for American Progress received information about ICE’s treatment of LGBT immigrants in detention for fiscal year 2017 from a congressional letter to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen from Rep. Kathleen Rice’s (D-NY) office. This information reveals that LGBT immigrants are being held in detention for long periods of time, in unsafe conditions, and at a far greater risk of sexual violence than the general population.</span> These facts indicate that Laura’s story is not unique under the Trump administration’s policy of treating every unauthorized immigrant as a deportation priority. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>LGBT immigrants in detention report high rates of sexual assault and sexual abuse</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>ICE’s 2014 Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) regulations require an annual publication of sexual assault data. Making the data publicly available is important as a means of helping advocates hold ICE accountable for its response to sexual assault in detention. While ICE has not yet publicly released any of the required annual data since 2014, Rep. Rice requested data from ICE on sexual assault of people in detention, and these findings are staggering—even compared with the high rate of sexual victimization of LGBT people in U.S. jails and prisons</span>. ICE reported to Rep. Rice that it received 227 reports of sexual abuse and assault in FY 2017. Twenty-eight of these reports involved an LGBT victim. In FY 2017, ICE detained 323,591 people. ICE reported to Rep. Rice that in FY 2017, 467 immigrants disclosed being LGBT during intake to a detention facility. This means that although LGBT people were 0.14 percent of the people ICE detained in FY 2017, they accounted for 12 percent of victims of sexual abuse and assault in ICE detention that year. In other words, assuming each report of sexual violence is substantiated and involves a separate victim, LGBT people in ICE custody are 97 times more likely to be sexually victimized than non-LGBT people in detention. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>ICE is housing transgender immigrants in unsafe situations</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>ICE is placing LGBT immigrants in harm’s way by not releasing them from detention when they should be and has reverted to its practice of detaining transgender women with men or in solitary confinement, contrary to its own rules</span>. In recognition of their heightened vulnerability to sexual abuse, DHS’ PREA rule requires an individualized placement determination for transgender people. In its response to Rep. Rice, ICE claims it is making these assessments. However, the custody data that Rep. Rice received indicate this is not the case. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Despite the continued existence of an Obama-era memo on caring for transgender immigrants, not one of the nearly 250 facilities ICE detains immigrants in is bound to comply with this guidance. Rather than automatically applying across DHS detention facilities, this guidance requires a contractual agreement with the facility</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. ICE opened a pod for transgender immigrants in Cibola County, New Mexico, but that facility’s contract with ICE does not include a requirement that it comply with the transgender care memo</span>. ICE reported to Rep. Rice that it detains transgender women in 17 facilities. Four are all-male facilities. Thirteen have a mix of male and female populations. Except for the transgender pod at Cibola, ICE has not provided information about whether ICE detained transgender women with other women, with men, or in isolation in these facilities. The average amount of time transgender people were detained in FY 2017 was 99 days, more than double the 43.7 day average all immigrants spent in ICE custody. With nearly 80 countries criminalizing LGBT people, the extended period of time they spend in detention may be due to waiting for a judge to review their cases for relief from deportation, such as asylum. Rep. Rice’s office also obtained information about the use of solitary confinement for LGBT immigrants in detention. In recognition of the risks that come with placing vulnerable populations, such as LGBT people, in solitary confinement, ICE’s own rules stipulate that solitary should only be used as a last resort. In those cases, solitary confinement should “not ordinarily exceed a period of 30 days.” According to Rep. Rice’s office, 1 in 8 transgender people detained by ICE were placed in solitary confinement in FY 2017. The United Nations recognizes the placement of LGBT people in solitary confinement for their own protection as a form of torture. After 15 days, solitary confinement may cause irreversible psychological damage. According to the information that ICE provided Rep. Rice, LGBT immigrants who were detained in solitary for more than 14 days spent an average of 52 days in solitary confinement.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Abuse is rampant – the aff’s mechanism is amoral </div><div class='cite'>Hananel 18</div><div class='card-body'><p>5-30-18 Sam Hananel - Associate Director of Media Relations at Center for American Progress. “RELEASE: LGBT Immigrants in Detention Centers at Severe Risk of Sexual Abuse, CAP Analysis Says” https://www.americanprogress.org/press/release/2018/05/30/451380/release-lgbt-immigrants-detention-centers-severe-risk-sexual-abuse-cap-analysis-says/</p><p><span class='card-underline'>Disturbing new government data shows that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>LGBT immigrants held at federal detention centers are 97 times more likely to be sexually assaulted than other detainees,</span></span><span class='card-underline'> according to an analysis by the Center for American Progress.</span><span class='card-underline'> </span>The CAP analysis is based on data from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that was requested by Rep.

But the anonymity of a being in a big city didn’t last long: During World AIDS Day in 2005, Anene says Nigeria’s then-president was visiting a health fair in Abuja where ARN had a booth. “One of the reporters yelled ‘Are you gay?’ ” Anene recalls. “The head of our organization admitted ‘Yeah, I’m gay’ on national TV. That was the beginning of the backlash.” Anene says that this moment of queer visibility ignited a national movement to crackdown on LGBTQ expression, despite the fact that gay sex was already illegal. The campaign culminated in the Same-Sex Marriage Prohibition Act of 2014, which imposes a 10-year prison sentence on anyone who “registers, operates or participates in gay clubs, societies, and organization.” The public persecution made Anene’s work increasingly risky: “I tried to keep a low profile,” he says. “But when you show up on the news, it starts to get really dangerous.” After being harassed and receiving multiple death threats, Anene says he began to fear for his life. So, during a visit to the United States five years ago, he reached out to Immigration Equality, a New York–based nonprofit organization that provides free legal representation to LGBTQ people, and began the process of seeking asylum. “My mom has a saying,” he says. “ ‘He who fights and runs away, lives to fight another day.’ ” <span class='card-underline'>Like Anene, thousands of people around the world are forced to flee their home country every year because of their sexual orientation or gender identity, and an increasing number end up in the United States.</span> According to a 2012 report from the Heartland Alliance, an estimated 3,500 LGBTQ refugees arrive in the U.S. annually: Every year, 1,250 queer people are granted asylum. <span class='card-underline'>But attaining refugee status is a complex and difficult journey, throughout which asylum-seekers like Anene must constantly negotiate visibility. Because while being out back home could get you killed or thrown in jail, during the asylum process, visibility can be the only way to prove you need protection. And even if their claim is successful, LGBTQ refugees are forced to confront the reality of a country that can often be hostile to immigrants, queers, and people of color.</span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>“</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Visibility is a double-sided sword</span></span><span class='card-underline'>,”</span> says Siobhán McGuirk, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University whose research focuses on migration and sexuality. “<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Being visible becomes necessary for a case, but </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>it also puts people at risk</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.”</span> Under international asylum law, to qualify for refugee status, asylum-seekers need to prove that they are members of a minority group and have a “well-founded fear of persecution.” To prove their membership to this marginalized group, in this case being LGBTQ, refugees have to show both visibility and immutability—the fact that their status is unchanging. “I don’t know what ‘looking gay’ means—it’s ridiculous.” Oliver Anene <span class='card-underline'>But for LGBTQ asylum-seekers, both of these criteria can be problematic. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Immutability often discounts people that are bisexual or sexually fluid,</span></span><span class='card-underline'> says McGuirk, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>and as for visibility, “Why would anyone be visible if visibility means persecution or death?”</span></span><span class='card-underline'> But in an interview with an adjudicator, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>asylum-</span></span><span class='card-underline'>seekers are required to offer evidence of their sexuality or gender identity.</span> “You might be asked for photos of you and your partner,” says Jackie Yodashkin, Public Affairs Director at Immigration Equality. “But often people don’t take them, and why would you keep them when it’s so dangerous?” Anene, from Nigeria, was lucky. While the visibility of his activism made him a target in Nigeria, it afforded him ample evidence for his asylum case, and his refugee status was approved relatively quickly. But for many people, the process can be much longer and more difficult. “<span class='card-underline'>Sometimes it </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>hinges on telling your story</span></span>,” says Yodashkin. “People get asked really invasive questions. It can be a harrowing process of recounting persecution.” Marja, 33, is a gay woman from Eastern Europe, where she was constantly trying to hide who she was: “I became a master of deflection,” she says. But eventually, the fear of being found out became too much. “I had to find an escape to save myself, to save my sanity, my life.” Diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder, she is seeking asylum in the U.S. But putting together her case has meant reliving the trauma she was trying to leave behind. “I came here to forget and to heal, so it’s hard to go through everything again,” she says. “It’s emotionally exhausting. The burden on top of the mountain of burdens.” <span class='card-underline'>McGuirk, the Georgetown professor, says </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>asylum-seekers must also confront preconceived notions of what an LGBTQ person looks like</span></span><span class='card-underline'> in the interview process: “Being out and proud is understood in a very homonormative, mainstream way,” she says. According to Anene, such attitudes mean asylum-seekers may try to conform to an adjudicator's stereotyped expectations. “The other day a friend was asking me if he should wear makeup or a dress to the interview to look more gay,” he says with a laugh.</span> “I don’t know what ‘looking gay’ means—it’s ridiculous.” While attitudes like these are improving in places like New York or San Francisco with large queer communities, McGuirk says that in the South, it can be more challenging to get past these kinds of outdated ideas about queer visibility: “The differences can be quite shocking,” she says. “There’s no consistency across asylum adjudication.” According to the report from Heartland Alliance, in 2010, there were 4,168 LGBT asylees living in California, versus just 263 in Texas. And while the national average for asylum approval is 48 percent, in states like Georgia it can be as low as 2 percent. This disparity disproportionately affects Latinx asylum-seekers, who are more likely to arrive as undocumented by crossing into the U.S. over land, and it privileges more financially stable refugees who can fly into places like New York. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Among those</span></span><span class='card-underline'> undocumented LGBTQ </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>people</span></span><span class='card-underline'> who do make it into the U.S., McGuirk says that all too often, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>they are thrown in detention</span></span><span class='card-underline'> by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>before even knowing that asylum is an option</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>.</span> “<span class='card-underline'>They’re immediately forced into the defensive</span>,” she says. A report from the Center for American Progress titled "ICE Officers Overwhelmingly Use Their Discretion to Detain LGBT Immigrants" found that “LGBT immigrants were detained with startling regularity regardless of legal requirements, vulnerability to abuse, or even the absence of flight risk or risk to public safety.” Immigration activists fear this could get worse under the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. “People are scared to go to Pride this year,” says Yodashkin. “They’re scared to be visible.” <span class='card-underline'>If detained, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>trans women especially face much greater dangers than cisgender immigrants</span></span><span class='card-underline'>: A November 2013 Government Accountability Office report found that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>one-fifth of confirmed sexual assault cases</span></span><span class='card-underline'> between 2009 and 2013 in detention facilities </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>involved trans immigrants</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> “It’s dangerous for anyone to be in an immigration detention center,” says Yodashkin. “But trans folks are especially targeted for violence. It’s just not a safe place.” ICE has attempted to address this issues by placing trans people in special individual pods, but this can lead to isolation, and, according to the CAP report, “even with this precaution, abuse persists.” The Trump administration’s travel ban, recently reinstated by the Supreme Court until it can consider the order’s constitutionality in October, is another major concern for LGBTQ asylum-seekers. The executive order, which bars entry to anyone from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, or Yemen and places a 120-day ban on refugees, could be particularly damaging to LGBTQ people, who may be fleeing anti-gay laws and persecution in these countries. “It disproportionately affects queer people,” says Yodashkin of the travel ban. “And it could leave people stuck in countries where it’s not safe.

I was fleeing Nigeria so I could stop hiding who I was, and here I was again trying to pretend to be straight.” Marja was lucky: She got taken in by a lesbian couple for her first few months in the U.S. “Seeing how they as a couple were so accepted by society, in a church setting, was extremely beneficial,” says Marja. “The beginning of stopping to hate myself for being gay. To see that you can be loved.” Once she got her work permit, Marja was able to find a steady job and move into her own place: She now lives with a gay Russian couple who are also applying for asylum. But working hasn’t been without difficulties. “I have a lot of coworkers who come from countries with similar views towards gay people,” she says. “I’m not comfortable being out and proud.” This, too, is common: According to Scott Pohl, Senior Community-Based Protection Advisor for UNHCR, LGBTQ refugees can often face discrimination even within immigrant communities: “When people flee, the stigma that they experienced prior to their flight can come with them.” After spending three months in the homeless shelter, Anene’s asylum application was accepted: that year, he marched in New York Pride for the first time. “To say we are Nigerians and we’re gay in public was so overwhelming,” he says. “To represent Nigerians and other Africans was elating.” He’s gone to every New York Pride since. But according to Yodashkin, marching in Pride and <span class='card-underline'>being so visible may be too big a step for some asylum-seekers: “A lot of people just aren’t ready,” she says. “</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>It can feel like you’re lining up to be a target.”</span></span> Marja says that she went to Pride in Washington, D.C. this year, and while she enjoyed watching it, she didn’t feel comfortable marching in the parade. “I guess I’m not OK with being gay—it’s part of the healing process,” she says. “I feel part of the gay community, but the part that’s not loud and proud.” Others face even greater challenges at Pride events that have become increasingly mainstream. McGuirk says she’s spoken to many LGBTQ Muslims who are “appalled by the comments made to them” at Pride events. “LGBTQ Muslims do want to engage and talk about transphobia and homophobia in their community,” she says. “But they’re also forced to talk about Islamophobia and transphobia in the gay community, and that can be very draining.” Anene, too, admits that “gay culture can be overwhelming.” But for him, the most difficult part of living in the U.S. has been confronting racism. “When you grow up in Africa as a gay man, that’s the only difference you have,” he says. “The color of your skin isn’t important. Then you move here and you start to see the inequality that’s happening.” For McGuirk, this is a part of the conversation on asylum that too often gets left out. “Being a black immigrant who is also LGBT, the U.S. is not a safe place for you,” she says. Yodashkin agrees: “There are so many different levels of discrimination that people have to navigate. It’s always a dance.” Despite his background in activism, Anene and his Nigerian friends found it hard at first to relate to the Black Lives Matter movement: “We don’t consider ourselves African American,” he says. “We didn’t feel like we should engage in the conversation.” But after experiencing discrimination firsthand too many times, Anene began to realize that racism doesn’t discriminate. “The system is rigged to deprive people of color of a healthy life,” he says. “A police officer isn’t going to be like ‘Oh, you’re from Africa, you’re OK.’ It’s not going to happen.” Still, Anene’s main focus continues to be LGBTQ rights, and he is working with and volunteering at several organizations in New York. But ultimately he wants to return to Nigeria, as soon as he gets American citizenship. “Going with a U.S. passport will offer me some protection, so I can get more involved, be louder,” he says. “Hopefully one day Nigeria will become more accepting. But people have to fight for it. That’s why I have to go back.” </p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'><span class='card-highlight'>No war – leaders have incentives to contain escalation – any claim to the contrary assumes the old guard</span>  </div><div class='cite'><span class='card-highlight'>Malin 12</span> [Martin Malin is the Executive Director on Project on Managing the Atom at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard, 5-28-2012, “Unconventional Wisdom”, The Bulletin,  http://thebulletin.org/unconventional-wisdom] </div><div class='card-body'><p><span class='card-underline'>As negotiations with Iran over the future of its nuclear program inch toward a possible deal, another intractable Middle East problem with a nuclear dimension is likely to start getting more serious attention. It is the question of whether there is any chance that Israel, Iran, and their Arab neighbors will agree to discuss establishing a regional zone free of all nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and their delivery systems</span>.¶ Earlier this month in Vienna, Jaakko Laajava, a Finnish diplomat and the facilitator of the proposed 2012 Middle East WMD-Free Zone Conference, reported to the Non-Proliferation Treaty preparatory committee meeting that although he had conducted more than 100 meetings -- both inside and outside the region -- he had yet to secure an agreement from all relevant states on participation. News of Laajava's no-news statement was met with another round of eye-rolling and finger-pointing: <span class='card-underline'>The likely holdouts are Israel and Iran, with a major question mark hanging over Syrian participation.</span>¶ After decades of backsliding, proliferation, and conflict in the Middle East, <span class='card-underline'>the conventional wisdom says the current round of efforts will fail.</span> I think <span class='card-underline'>the conventional wisdom is wrong.</span>¶ <span class='card-underline'>In the past, many leaders in the Middle East have seen chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons as an attractive answer to their problems. But this logic is changing.</span> <span class='card-underline'>Developments in the region are creating conditions that make progress on arms control and disarmament more possible, not less.</span>¶ Reviewing matters within. Internal conditions throughout the Middle East are becoming less conducive for either sparking or sustaining WMD programs. Arab protesters are demanding less corruption and more government accountability. Large, secretive WMD programs supporting unaccountable military-industrial cliques will be harder to support in the region's emerging political economies<span class='card-highlight'>.</span> <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The domestic political struggles underway across the Middle East have both leaders in power and their opponents focusing inward on reform, not outward toward old enemies</span></span>.¶ <span class='card-underline'>If democratic processes begin to take root </span>(and, admittedly, it is premature to say that they will), <span class='card-underline'>what effect will this have on the perceived role of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons? </span>Research by political scientists Harald Müller and Andreas Schmidt suggests that democratizing states, in need of international acceptance and support, are particularly sensitive to nonproliferation norms and loathe to violate them.¶ <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Regional evolution. The region's historic military rivalries have receded and the security rationale for WMD is receding with them</span></span>. Iraq, which was once Iran's bitterest enemy and in US crosshairs for its WMD programs (real and imagined), now closely coordinates its policies with both Tehran and Washington. <span class='card-underline'>Tension in the Saudi-Iranian relationship requires the attention of leaders in Riyadh and Tehran, but in no way resembles the military rivalry that once existed between Iran and Iraq.</span><span class='card-underline'>¶</span><span class='card-underline'> Inter-Arab animosity has also moderated.</span> In April, when demonstrations erupted outside its embassy in Cairo, Saudi Arabia quickly withdrew its ambassador, Ahmed Qattan. But within a week, Riyadh reinstated Qattan and promised a major aid package to Egypt. Contrast that incident with Saudi-Egyptian relations in the 1960s, when Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser deployed his country's troops in Yemen to defeat Saudi proxies and used poison gas to do the job. Times have changed¶ T<span class='card-underline'>he Arab-Israeli conflict, the original driver of Israel's nuclear weapons program, has been reduced</span> to two issues: the core question of Israeli-Palestinian relations and the future of the Golan Heights. <span class='card-underline'>Although </span>each problem <span class='card-underline'>is vexing, neither is any longer the spark that can ignite region-wide conflict and threaten Israel's very existence.</span> Israel's peace with Egypt may cool even further, but neither of Egypt's presidential candidates calls for abrogating the treaty because the treaty is as much an anchor of Egypt's national security as it is of Israel's.¶ Israeli and Iranian calculations. As Israel considers how best to secure its future, it must choose among three strategic options.¶ <span class='card-underline'>Israel can try to extend its nuclear monopoly by attacking or sabotaging the nuclear projects of Iran and perhaps other states down the road. This option</span>, Israel's policy for the past several decades, <span class='card-underline'>is becoming increasingly untenable. In the short- to medium-term, bombing carries the risk of retaliation, and the unintended consequence of fueling the nuclear ambitions it is trying to stamp out.</span> And Israel can only bomb what it knows about. But the long-term problem is more profound: Can Israel sustain a policy of militarily preventing nuclear development in a neighborhood of growing interest in nuclear power and a progressive diffusion of technology?¶ Israel's second option -- deterrence -- carries the price of eventually abandoning nuclear ambiguity, since maintaining an active deterrent through periods of crisis and change in Iranian capabilities will require explicit statements and even demonstrations of Israeli capability. Such demonstrations will threaten and provoke Arab states in a way that Israel's nuclear weapons now do not, further raising the costs and risks of deterrence.¶ In light of the above choices, Israel may come to see the third option as the least unpalatable: Entering into negotiations with its neighbors to establish rules for limiting the possession of WMD across the region, eventually putting its own capabilities on the negotiating table. Discussing a WMD-free zone would allow Israel to prolong its nuclear weapons monopoly with the fewest challenges for an interim period, while negotiating the terms of a transition to a nuclear and WMD free Middle East. It can also use a forum on regional arms control as a venue to raise its concerns about proliferation elsewhere in the region.¶ Iran has important security interests in pursuing a WMD-free zone. Tehran has a long-term strategic interest in denuclearizing Israel, and, odious as it might seem to Iran's leaders, direct negotiations with Israel on regional security and a WMD ban are the only way to do that. Iran would find other security benefits from engaging diplomatically on the issue: <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Regional security discussions can help Iran break out of its isolation.</span></span> In WMD-free zone discussions, Iran can split the US-Arab coalition against it and focus attention on Israel's nuclear weapons. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The creation of a zone -- if it were to occur in the next several years -- would leave Iran far ahead of its Arab neighbors in its nuclear knowledge and experience, preserving an important security hedge, while reducing the incentives for its neighbors to attempt to match its expensive fuel-cycle investment</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span><span class='card-underline'>¶</span> Wild cards. If the current P5+1 negotiations with Tehran collapse and Israel or the United States attack Iran, then both the political and security justifications for proliferation will be reinforced across the region. Voices within Iran calling for an operational deterrent will gain traction. And similar arguments will reverberate in Riyadh, Cairo, and possibly elsewhere. Failure of the proposal to hold a conference in 2012 on a Middle East WMD-free zone will be the least of concerns.¶ <span class='card-underline'>Syria also presents potential problems. In the short-term, having suspended its membership in the Arab League for its violent crackdown on protesters, many Arab states would prefer not to reward the Assad regime with a platform at a conference to discuss weapons of mass destruction. In the long-term, competitive external intervention in a Syrian civil war could help reverse the trends supporting the move toward WMD disarmament.</span> Syrian behavior, together with its chemical weapons stocks, should remind everyone why the discussion of a WMD-free zone and regional security more broadly in the Middle East is urgent. The short-term political costs of Syrian participation are trivial by comparison.¶ Predictions. In capitals across the Middle East, policy makers will soon be pressed for their responses to a proposal to meet in Finland to discuss a regional WMD ban, possibly in December. Though Tehran and Jerusalem will grasp at old arguments to insist that the idea is foolish or unnecessary, a cold, hard look at emerging security interests in the new Middle East will take a bite out of old dogmas. Invitations to Helsinki will bring Israel and Iran to the negotiation table. Undoubtedly<span class='card-underline'>, the process will be long and frustrating. But the conventional wisdom will be overturned.</span> </p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'><span class='card-highlight'>No regional war escalation – empirics prove time and time again</span></div><div class='cite'><span class='card-highlight'>Drum</span>  <span class='card-highlight'>7</span>[Kevin Drum is a political staff writer for the Washington Monthly, 9-9-2007, “The Chaos Hawks”, Washington Monthly, https://washingtonmonthly.com/2007/09/09/the-chaos-hawks/]</div><div class='card-body'><p>Having admitted, however, that the odds of a military success in Iraq are almost impossibly long, Chaos Hawks nonetheless insist that the U.S. military needs to stay in Iraq for the foreseeable future.

It is part of an attempt to make critical evaluation an intrinsic element of responsibility. Responsibility to this more fundamental ethic gives the ethic of consequences meaning. Consequentialism and responsibility are here drawn into what Schluchter, in terms that will be familiar to anyone conversant with constructivism in International Relations, has called a 'reflexive principle'. In the wilful Realist vision, <span class='card-underline'>scepticism and consequentialism are linked in an attempt to construct not just </span>a more substantial vision of <span class='card-underline'>political responsibility, but also the kinds of actors who might adopt it, and the kinds of social structures that might support it</span>. A consequentialist ethic is not simply a choice adopted by actors: it is a means of trying to foster particular kinds of self-critical individuals and societies, and in so doing to encourage a means by which one can justify and foster a politics of responsibility. <span class='card-underline'>The ethic </span>of responsibility in wilful Realism <span class='card-underline'>thus involves a commitment to both autonomy and limitation, to freedom and restraint, to an acceptance of limits and the criticism of limits</span>. Responsibility clearly involves prudence and an accounting for current structures and their historical evolution; but it is not limited to this, for it seeks ultimately the creation of responsible subjects within a philosophy of limits. Seen in this light, the Realist commitment to objectivity appears quite differently. Objectivity in terms of consequentialist analysis does not simply take the actor or action as given, it is a political practice — an attempt to foster a responsible self, undertaken by an analyst with a commitment to objectivity which is itself based in a desire to foster a politics of responsibility. <span class='card-underline'>Objectivity in the sense of coming to terms with the 'reality' of contextual conditions and likely outcomes </span>of action <span class='card-underline'>is not only necessary for success, it is vital for self-reflection, for sustained engagement with the practical and ethical adequacy of one's views</span>. The blithe, self-serving, and <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>uncritical stances of abstract moralism</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>or rationalist objectivism <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>avoid self-criticism by refusing to engage with the intractability of the world 'as it is'. Reducing the world to an expression of their </span></span><span class='card-highlight'>t</span>heoretical models, political platforms, or <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>ideological programmes, they fail to engage with this reality, and thus avoid the process of self-reflection at the heart of responsibility</span></span>. By contrast, Realist objectivity takes an engagement with this intractable 'object' that is not reducible to one's wishes or will as a necessary condition of ethical engagement, self-reflection, and self-creation.7 Objectivity is not a naive naturalism in the sense of scientific laws or rationalist calculation; it is a necessary engagement with a world that eludes one's will. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>A recognition of the limits imposed by 'reality' is a condition for a recognition of one's own limits — that the world is not simply an extension of one's own will</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>.</span> <span class='card-underline'>But it is also a challenge to use that intractability as a source of possibility, as providing a set of openings </span>within which a suitably chastened and yet paradoxically energised will to action can responsibly be pursued. In the wilful Realist tradition, the essential opacity of both the self and the world are taken as limiting principles. <span class='card-underline'>Limits upon understanding </span>provide chastening parameters for claims about the world and actions within it. But they also <span class='card-underline'>provide challenging and creative openings within which diverse forms of life can be developed: the limited unity of the self and the political order is the precondition for freedom. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The </span></span>ultimate<span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>opacity of the world is not to be despaired of: it is a condition of possibility for the wilful, creative construction of selves and social orders which embrace the diverse human potentialities</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>which this lack of essential or intrinsic order makes possible.8 But it is also to be aware of the less salutary possibilities this involves.

Any number of policies might work, and others, although seemingly consistent with the moral principle, will fail utterly. That deontological principles are an inadequate basis for environmental policy is evident in the rather significant irony that most forms of deontologically based environmental laws and regulations tend to be implemented in a very utilitarian manner by street-level enforcement officials. Moreover, ignoring the relevant costs and benefits of environmental policy and their attendant incentive structures can, as alluded to above, actually work at cross purposes to environmental preservation. (There exists an extensive literature on this aspect of regulatory enforcement and the often perverse outcomes of regulatory policy. See, for example, Ackerman, 1981; Bartrip and Fenn, 1983; Hawkins, 1983, 1984; Hawkins and Thomas, 1984.)

Moreover, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>anyone who claims to have such a theory</span></span>, or even part of one, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>almost certainly doesn't</span></span>. Instead, what that person probably has is a moral rationalization. It seems then, that we have somehow crossed the infamous "is"-"ought" divide. How did this happen? Didn't Hume (Hume, 1978) and Moore (Moore, 1966) warn us against trying to derive an "ought" from and "is?" How did we go from descriptive scientific theories concerning moral psychology to skepticism about a whole class of normative moral theories? The answer is that we did not, as Hume and Moore anticipated, attempt to derive an "ought" from and "is." That is, our method has been inductive rather than deductive. We have inferred on the basis of the available evidence that the phenomenon of rationalist deontological philosophy is best explained as a rationalization of evolved emotional intuition (Harman, 1977).<span class='card-underline'> Missing the Deontological Point </span>I suspect that <span class='card-underline'>rationalist</span> <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>deontologists</span></span><span class='card-underline'> will remain unmoved</span> <span class='card-underline'>by the arguments presented here</span>. Instead, I suspect, <span class='card-underline'>they</span> <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>will insist that</span></span><span class='card-underline'> I have</span> <span class='card-underline'>simply misunderstood</span> <span class='card-underline'>what</span>Kant and like-minded <span class='card-underline'>deontologists</span> <span class='card-underline'>are all about</span>. <span class='card-underline'>Deontology, they will say, isn't about this intuition or that intuition</span>. It's not defined by its normative differences with consequentialism. <span class='card-underline'>Rather, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>deontology is about taking humanity seriousl</span></span><span class='card-underline'>y</span>. Above all else, it's about respect for persons. It's about treating others as fellow rational creatures rather than as mere objects, about acting for reasons rational beings can share. And so on (Korsgaard, 1996a; Korsgaard, 1996b).<span class='card-underline'>This is, no doubt, how many deontologists see deontology. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>But this insider's view</span></span>, as I've suggested, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>may be misleading</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>.</span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The problem</span></span>, more specifically, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is that it defines deontology in terms of values that are not</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>distinctively</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>deontological</span></span>, though they may appear to be from the inside. <span class='card-underline'>Consider the following analogy with religion. When one asks a religious person to explain the essence of his religion, one often gets an answer like this: "It's about love</span>, really. It's about looking out for other people, looking beyond oneself. It's about community, being part of something larger than oneself." <span class='card-underline'>This sort of answer accurately captures the phenomenology of many people's religion, but it's nevertheless inadequate for distinguishing religion from other things</span>. This is because many, if not most, non-religious people aspire to love deeply, look out for other people, avoid self-absorption, have a sense of a community, and be connected to things larger than themselves. In other words, secular humanists and atheists can assent to most of what many religious people think religion is all about. From a secular humanist's point of view, in contrast, what's distinctive about religion is its commitment to the existence of supernatural entities as well as formal religious institutions and doctrines. And they're right. These things really do distinguish religious from non-religious practices, though they may appear to be secondary to many people operating from within a religious point of view. In the same way, I believe that most of <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the standard</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>deontological/Kantian self-characterizatons</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>fail to distinguish deontology from other approaches to ethics</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>.</span> (See also Kagan (Kagan, 1997, pp. 70-78.) on the difficulty of defining deontology.) It seems to me that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>consequentialists</span></span>, as much as anyone else, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>have respect for persons</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>are</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>against treating people as</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>mere</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>objects</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>wish</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>to act for reasons that rational creatures can share</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, etc</span>. <span class='card-underline'>A consequentialist respects other persons, and refrains from treating them as mere objects,</span> <span class='card-underline'>by counting</span><span class='card-underline'> every person's well-being</span> <span class='card-underline'>in the decision-making process</span>. <span class='card-underline'>Likewise, a</span> <span class='card-underline'>consequentialist</span> <span class='card-underline'>attempts to act according to reasons that rational creatures can share by acting according to</span> <span class='card-underline'>principles</span> <span class='card-underline'>that</span> <span class='card-underline'>give equal weight to everyone's interests</span><span class='card-underline'>, i.e. that are impartial</span>. This is not to say that consequentialists and deontologists don't differ. They do. It's just that the real differences may not be what deontologists often take them to be. What, then, distinguishes deontology from other kinds of moral thought? A good strategy for answering this question is to start with concrete disagreements between deontologists and others (such as consequentialists) and then work backward in search of deeper principles. This is what I've attempted to do with the trolley and footbridge cases, and other instances in which deontologists and consequentialists disagree. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>If you ask a deontologically-minded</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>person why it's wrong to push someone in front of</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>speeding</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>trolley</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>in order</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>to save five others</span></span>, you will getcharacteristically deontological <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>answers</span></span>.

"You have to respect people's rights." <span class='card-underline'>But</span>, as we know, <span class='card-underline'>these answers don't really explain anything</span>, because <span class='card-underline'>if you give the same people</span> (on different occasions) <span class='card-underline'>the trolley case</span> or the loop case (See above), <span class='card-underline'>they'll make the opposite judgment</span>, even though their initial explanation concerning the footbridge case applies equally well to one or both of these cases. <span class='card-underline'>Talk about rights,</span> <span class='card-underline'>respect for persons, and reasons we can share</span> <span class='card-underline'>are natural attempts to explain, in "cognitive" terms, what we feel</span> <span class='card-underline'>when we find ourselves having emotionally driven intuitions that are odds with the cold calculus of consequentialism</span>.

It also includes our interest in the lives of our children and grandchildren, and the hope that they will be able, in turn, to have the lives of their children and grandchildren as projects.  To the extent that a policy or practice seems likely to be favorable or unfavorable to the carrying out of this complex of projects in the nearer or further future, we have reason to pursue or avoid it.  … <span class='card-underline'>Continuity</span><span class='card-underline'> is as important to our commitment to the project of the future of humanity as it is to our commitment to the projects of our own </span><span class='card-underline'>personal futures</span><span class='card-underline'>.  </span>Just as the shape of my whole life, and its connection with my present and past, have an interest that goes beyond that of any isolated experience, so too <span class='card-underline'>the shape of human history over an extended period of the future</span>, and its connection with the human present and past, <span class='card-underline'>have an interest that </span><span class='card-underline'>goes beyond</span><span class='card-underline'> that of the</span> (total or average) <span class='card-underline'>quality of life of a population-at-a-time</span>, considered in isolation from how it got that way. We owe, I think, some loyalty to this project of the human future.  We also owe it a respect that we would owe it even if we were not of the human race ourselves, but beings from another planet who had some understanding of it.

Further, many theological perspectives deplore naturalistic existential catastrophes, especially ones induced by human activities:  If God created the world and the human species, one would imagine that He might be displeased if we took it upon ourselves to smash His masterpiece (or if, through our negligence or hubris, we allowed it to come to irreparable harm).[25] We might also consider the issue from a less theoretical standpoint and try to form an evaluation instead by considering analogous cases about which we have definite moral intuitions.

Bakhtin, it is only in this not‑yet accomplished world of anticipation and trial, leaning toward stubbornly an‑other Other, that life can be lived ‑ not in the world of the `events that occurred'; in the latter world, `it is impossible to live, to act responsibly; in it, I am not needed, in principle I am not there at all." Art, the Other, the future: what unites them, what makes them into three words vainly trying to grasp the same mystery, is the modality of possibility. A curious modality, at home neither in ontology nor epistemology; itself, like that which it tries to catch in its net, `always outside', forever `otherwise than being'. The possibility we are talking about here is not the all‑too‑familiar unsure‑of‑itself, and through that uncertainty flawed, inferior and incomplete being, disdainfully dismissed by triumphant existence as `mere possibility', `just a possibility'; possibility is instead `plus que la reahte' ‑ both the origin and the foundation of being. The hope, says Blanchot, proclaims the possibility of that which evades the possible; `in its limit, this is the hope of the bond recaptured where it is now lost."' The hope is always the hope of being fu filled, but what keeps the hope alive and so keeps the being open and on the move is precisely its unfu filment. One may say that the paradox of hope (and the paradox of possibility founded in hope) is that it may pursue its destination solely through betraying its nature; the most exuberant of energies expends itself in the urge towards rest. Possibility uses up its openness in search of closure. Its image of the better being is its own impoverishment . . . The togetherness of the being‑for is cut out of the same block; it shares in the paradoxical lot of all possibility. It lasts as long as it is unfulfilled, yet it uses itself up in never ending effort of fulfilment, of recapturing the bond, making it tight and immune to all future temptations. In an important, perhaps decisive sense, it is selfdestructive and self‑defeating: its triumph is its death. The Other, like restless and unpredictable art, like the future itself, is a mystery. And being‑for‑the‑Other, going towards the Other through the twisted and rocky gorge of affection, brings that mystery into view ‑ makes it into a challenge. That mystery is what has triggered the sentiment in the first place ‑ but cracking that mystery is what the resulting movement is about. The mystery must be unpacked so that the being‑for may focus on the Other: one needs to know what to focus on. (The `demand' is unspoken, the responsibility undertaken is unconditional; it is up to him or her who follows the demand and takes up the responsibility to decide what the following of that demand and carrying out of that responsibility means in practical terms.) Mystery ‑ noted Max Frisch ‑ (and the Other is a mystery), is an exciting puzzle, but one tends to get tired of that excitement. `And so one creates for oneself an image. This is a loveless act, the betrayal." Creating an image of the Other leads to the substitution of the image for the Other; the Other is now fixed ‑ soothingly and comfortingly. There is nothing to be excited about anymore. I know what the Other needs, I know where my responsibility starts and ends. Whatever the Other may now do will be taken down and used against him. What used to be received as an exciting surprise now looks more like perversion; what used to be adored as exhilarating creativity now feels like wicked levity. Thanatos has taken over from Eros, and the excitement of the ungraspable turned into the dullness and tedium of the grasped. But, as Gyorgy Lukacs observed, `everything one person may know about another is only expectation, only potentiality, only wish or fear, acquiring reality only as a result of what happens later, and this reality, too, dissolves straightaway into potentialities'. <span class='card-underline'>Only death, with its finality and irreversibility, puts an end to</span> the musical‑chairs game of <span class='card-underline'>the real and the potential </span><span class='card-underline'>‑</span> it once and for all closes the embrace of togetherness which was before invitingly <span class='card-underline'>open </span>and tempted the lonely self." `Creating an image' is the dress rehearsal of that death. But creating an image is the inner urge, the constant temptation, the must of all affection . . . It is the loneliness of being abandoned to an unresolvable ambivalence and an unanchored and formless sentiment which sets in motion the togetherness of being‑for. But what loneliness seeks in togetherness is an end to its present condition ‑ an end to itself. Without knowing ‑ without being capable of knowing ‑ that the hope to replace the vexing loneliness with togetherness is founded solely on its own unfulfilment, and that once loneliness is no more, the togetherness ( the being‑for togetherness) must also collapse, as it cannot survive its own completion. What the loneliness seeks in togetherness (suicidally for its own cravings) is the foreclosing and pre‑empting of the future, cancelling the future before it comes, robbing it of mystery but also of the possibility with which it is pregnant. Unknowingly yet necessarily, it seeks it all to its own detriment, since the success (if there is a success) may only bring it back to where it started and to the condition which prompted it to start on the journey in the first place. <span class='card-underline'>The togetherness of being</span><span class='card-underline'>‑</span>for is always in the future, and nowhere else. It is no more once the self proclaims: `I have arrived', `I have done it', `I fulfilled my duty.' The being‑for starts from the realization of the bottomlessness of the task, and ends with the declaration that the infinity has been exhausted. <span class='card-underline'>This is the tragedy of being</span><span class='card-underline'>‑</span>for <span class='card-underline'>‑</span> the reason why it cannot but be death<span class='card-underline'>‑</span>bound while simultaneously remaining an undying attraction. In this tragedy, there are many happy moments, but no happy end. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Death is always the foreclosure of possibilities</span></span>, and it comes eventually in its own time<span class='card-underline'>,</span> even if not brought forward by the impatience of love. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The catch is to direct the affection to staving off the end</span></span><span class='card-underline'>,</span> and to do this against the affection's nature. What follows is that, if moral relationship is grounded in the being-for togetherness (as it is), then it can exist as a project, and guide the self's conduct only as long as its nature of a project (a not yet-completed project) is not denied. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Morality, like the future itself, is forever not</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>‑</span></span>yet<span class='card-underline'>.</span> (And this is why the ethical code, any ethical code, the more so the more perfect it is by its own standards, supports morality the way the rope supports the hanged man.) It is because of our loneliness that we crave togetherness. It is because of our loneliness that we open up to the Other and allow the Other to open up to us. It is because of our loneliness (which is only belied, not overcome, by the hubbub of the being‑with) that we turn into moral selves. And <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>it is only through allowing the togetherness its possibilities which only the future can disclose that we stand a chance of acting morally</span></span>, and sometimes even of being good<span class='card-highlight'>, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>in the present</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>.</span></p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'><span class='card-highlight'>US has never led the fight for refugee’s – global leadership is dead and impossible at this point</span></div><div class='cite'><span class='card-highlight'>Bouie</span> 20<span class='card-highlight'>15</span> [Jamelle Bouie is Slate’s chief political correspondent, 11-17-2015, "We Are a Nation of Immigrants and Refugees.

On the continent, democratic and nationalist uprisings swept through France, Germany, and its neighbors, as reformists joined with middle- and working-class agitators to overturn monarchy and despotism. They won a few victories, but the reactionaries weren’t weak—in short order, forces led by Prussia and the Habsburgs in Vienna would crush the revolts and scatter these liberal movements to the winds. Meanwhile, in Ireland, a blight destroyed the potato crop and threatened millions with starvation, as British officials refused to help or intervene. Both events sparked mass migrations to the United States, as hundreds of thousands of Germans and Irish left their homes to escape political persecution, conflict, and famine. They followed a decade of similar but more modest immigration, stretching back to the 1830s, when the first major waves of German and Irish immigrants reached American shores. The Americans who met them were conflicted. On one hand, they believed in the Christian universalism, democratic equality, and its attendant faith in assimilation—the conviction, writes late historian John Higham in Strangers in the Land: Patterns of American Nativism, 1860–1925, “that this new land would bring unity out of diversity as a matter of course.” On the other, however, these migrants were alien, possessed of a religion—Catholicism—that seemed incompatible, if not hostile, to republican government. More than 3 million people came to American shores in the decade after 1845—the greatest increase in our history, relative to the overall population—and they exerted an immediate impact on American life and institutions, transforming cities across the Northeast and bringing a new wave of aggressive nativism, culminating in the anti-immigrant “Know-Nothing” movement, which spawned a political party. Its platform? “Repeal of all naturalization laws … War to the hilt, on political Romanism … Hostility to all Papal influences, when brought to bear against the Republic … The sending back of all foreign paupers.” The Know-Nothings burned hot—affiliated candidates swept several state legislatures in the 1854 elections—and quickly died out. By the end of the decade, sectional conflict over slavery had overcome immigration as the central issue of American politics. In the South, the Know-Nothing “American Party” dissolved in the face of Democratic dominance, and in the North, anti-slavery Know-Nothings were pulled into the nascent Republican Party. Despite the end of the Know-Nothings, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>nativism persisted in national life, as part of the deep ambivalence and fear Americans have felt towards migrants, immigrants, and refugees of various stripes.</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>You saw it in violent form</span></span>, for example, <span class='card-underline'>during the waves of Chinese immigration</span> in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when Chinese immigrants faced exclusion, discrimination, and outright pogroms from mobs of angry, resentful European Americans (some, no doubt, descended from Irish and German immigrants). You saw it <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>in the late 1930s, when Americans faced Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany</span></span>, and had to choose: Would we take the victims of Hitler’s anti-Semitism, or reject them? On the question of refugee children, at least, Americans said no: 67 percent opposed taking in 10,000 refugee children from Germany, according to a 1939 poll from Gallup. They were similarly unmoved by earlier groups of Jewish refugees, and their fears evoked the anxieties of their predecessors in 1848 and beyond. Americans, and their counterparts in Western Europe, feared foreign influence and dangerous ideologies like communism and anarchism. (Just a few decades earlier, in the living memory of many adults at the time, an anarchist killed an American president.) Again and again, <span class='card-underline'>when faced with the question of refugees and immigrants, Americans are ambivalent and sometimes hostile.</span> In 1975, for example, 62 percent said they feared Vietnamese refugees would take their jobs. Four years later, just as many said they didn’t want to admit “boat people” from Vietnam, who were fleeing the country’s repressive communist government. Americans said the same for Cuban refugees in the 1980s, Haitians in the 1990s, and most recently, the wave of refugee children from South America, which brought protests and fears of disease and infection. You can even apply this dynamic to the Great Migration, the huge movement of black Americans from the South to cities and towns across the country. These Americans were internal refugees, fleeing lawlessness and racist terrorism. When they reached their destinations—cities like Detroit and Chicago—they faced deep hostility from existing residents, who blamed them for crime and economic disadvantage. The broad point—<span class='card-underline'>the reason to focus on the these patterns of hostility—is to emphasize the extent to which they are part of the American tradition.</span> In calling for acceptance of Syrian refugees, President Obama, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the Conference of Catholic Bishops, and others are voicing one set of American values—the ones we want to hold ourselves to. But the same goes for Sen. Ted Cruz, Gov. Greg Abbott, and the other Republican governors and presidential candidates who want to reject them—those too are American values.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'><span class='card-highlight'>Integration infrastructure is weak</span> </div><div class='cite'><span class='card-highlight'>Reynolds</span> 20<span class='card-highlight'>17</span> [Oliver Reynolds, leading economist at Focuseconomics, "Bounty or burden? The impact of refugees on European economies is far from clear," FocusEconomics Economic Forecasts from the World's Leading Economists, 21 August 2017, https://www.focus-economics.com/blog/impact-of-refugees-on-european-economies // wyo-rrt]</div><div class='card-body'><p><span class='card-underline'>The economic impact is likely to be slightly positive in the short-term.</span> All the refugees arriving in the European Union need to be housed and fed. Their medical needs must be addressed, and both children and adults have to be educated in preparation for entry into local labor markets. Before they are ready to work, financial support is also necessary. The ensuing boost to government spending and fiscal transfers will give domestic demand a shot in the arm. According to estimates from the IMF, by the end of 2017 GDP in Austria, Germany and Sweden—three countries which have received large numbers of refugees per capita—will have been boosted by 0.5%, 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively. In Germany, by far the largest recipient in absolute terms, refugee-related expenditure amounted to more than EUR 20 billion last year. In the longer term, the picture becomes far murkier. This isn’t just because little is known about the current cohort of refugees, such as their average level of education or how long they will remain in their host countries. It is also because <span class='card-underline'>the long-term economic impact of refugees rests largely on how successful countries are at weaving them into the economic fabric of their societies.</span> The more refugees who find jobs, and the better paid these jobs are, the greater the positive impact on labor supply, the public coffers and economic growth. <span class='card-underline'>Upon arrival</span>, however, <span class='card-underline'>asylum seekers face myriad problems which hinder their integration into the labor market.</span> Many find that the <span class='card-underline'>qualifications they held in their home countries are no longer recognized</span>, and even those who hold valid qualifications are <span class='card-underline'>faced with a language barrier</span>; the vast majority of the refugees who have reached the European Union in the last few years lack basic competence in their host country’s language. <span class='card-underline'>The process of applying for and being granted asylum is also a protracted one, often lasting around six months</span>. In some European nations, it is even longer, as <span class='card-underline'>the sudden influx of refugees has led to a huge backlog of unprocessed claims.</span> <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>In many countries, asylum seekers are not normally allowed to work while their claims are being processed, increasing the risks of demotivation and deskilling</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> Even <span class='card-underline'>in Germany</span>, which is known for the efficiency of its bureaucracy and labor market, <span class='card-underline'>only around 500,000 of the 1.2 million refugees had completed the first stages of the integration process and signed up as job seekers by March 2017. Of these refugees, a mere 12% had found employment</span>. If past experience is anything to go by, the full economic integration of refugees will prove an arduous task. <span class='card-underline'>Studies from many developed countries have repeatedly shown that refugees tend to earn less, have worse employment prospects and hold lower occupational status than native workers or economic migrants.</span> Even in Sweden, a country with a relatively strong track record of integrating refugees, a study of those arriving between 1997 and 2010 found that fewer than 20% had found employment after one year. Ten years down the line, only between 50% and 60% were working, significantly below the corresponding figure for Swedish natives. However, there is much that nations can do to help refugees integrate more seamlessly into society. For instance, Germany’s integration law, which was approved by its parliament in 2016, provides culture and languages classes for newcomers. This policy is similar to Sweden’s longer-standing introduction program, which includes an interview with the Public Employment Service (PES) in order to create a tailored action plan for each refugee, and provides personalized training, employment assistance, and financial and housing support. Special measures in the labor market could also be considered, in order to overcome any initial jitters employers may have about hiring refugees. Wage subsidies for firms who hire refugees have proven effective in several Nordic countries. The experience of refugees in the Netherlands has shown that work at temporary agencies can be another useful stepping stone, helping new arrivals adjust to labor market conditions. Enabling asylum seekers to hit the ground running and apply for jobs upon arrival, provided certain conditions are met, would also help; this is currently the case in Sweden, for example. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Policies which boost the labor market participation rate more generally will likely have an outsized effect on refugees. Improving the geographical mobility of migrants, making labor markets suppler and thus more adaptable to tumultuous technological change, and avoiding welfare traps due to an overlap between the benefit system and the tax system would all help refugees get their foot on the employment ladder.</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span></p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'><span class='card-highlight'>Influx of refugees creates a litany of constraints and issues for host countries </span></div><div class='cite'><span class='card-highlight'>Shellito</span> 20<span class='card-highlight'>16</span> [Kevin Shellito, University of Pennsylvannia, 2016 "The Economic Effect of Refugee Crises on Host Countries and Implications for the Lebanese Case," Joseph Wharton Scholars, https:// repository .upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&context=joseph_wharton_scholars // wyo-rrt]</div><div class='card-body'><p><span class='card-underline'>Refugee crises may also bring negative </span>economic<span class='card-underline'> consequences.</span> Although this view is commonly heard in political punditry, existing academic literature has also identified many mechanisms in which these consequences occur, three of which are discussed below. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>First, refugees can strain the services systems of host countries.</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>These strains occur in the task of processing and receiving refugees as well as integrating them into the host country. Examples of expenses include housing, healthcare, education, food, water, and utilities</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>(Aiyar et al. 2016). Understandably, the quality of a specific service may go down as it becomes strained to accommodate more people. <span class='card-underline'>For example, in Turkey, increases in Syrian refugees have been associated with declines in quality of education and healthcare services</span> (Goksel and Ozturkler 2015). Similarly, in Europe, the IMF estimates that refugees will cost EU countries nearly 0.1 percent of GDP on average (Aiyar et al. 2016). <span class='card-underline'>The heavy amount of literature</span> (on the 1990s Balkan crisis, for example) <span class='card-underline'>that discusses “burden-sharing”—the cooperative process of one state taking responsibility for refugees that would usually fall under the purview of a different, but currently resource-strained,</span> state—also suggests that this public service strain is a serious and relevant concern. (Suhrke 1998; Shimizu and Sandler 2002; Hartley and Sandler 1999; Barutciski and Suhrke 2001). Similarly, in today’s crisis, those countries facing the largest strain 17 from refugees (for example, Turkey, Jordan, and Lebanon) have called upon the international community for more support and diffusion of financial responsibility (Lowe 2016; “In Jordan…” 2015). And while this paper earlier highlighted that some public expenditures may strengthen the long-term infrastructure of a country, this does not come without the short-term cost, namely increased taxation to pay for the project as well as the opportunity cost of foregoing other potential investment opportunities (Zetter 2012). <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Second</span></span><span class='card-underline'>,</span> and related to strained services, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is the issue of overcrowding in the host nation</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> When hundreds of thousands of refugees arrive in a concentrated area, disease can quickly break out (Caldwell 2015). <span class='card-underline'>The UN has reported that overcrowding has turned refugee camps</span>—in South Sudan, for example—<span class='card-underline'>from a welcoming refuge to a squalid encampment teeming with outbreaks of Hepatitis, cholera, malaria, and jaundice</span> (Sinha 2012). <span class='card-underline'>This has</span> immediate negative economic effects, but can also have <span class='card-underline'>long-term</span> economic <span class='card-underline'>effects by negatively impacting maternal and early childhood health</span> (Baez 2011). In line with this idea of a lack of physical space, <span class='card-underline'>refugees may also crowd out natives in local economic markets—from food to housing—and distort prices</span> (Hatton and Williamson 2003). Turkey, for example, has seen dramatic increases in rental prices for housing as a result of the refugee crisis (Orhan and Gundogar 2015). <span class='card-underline'>In some cases, unscrupulous—but opportunistic—landlords have kicked out lower income Turkish tenants in favor of Syrians, many of which may have a higher willingness and capacity to pay (</span>Orhan and Gundogar 2015). Additionally, while the aforementioned study of refugees from Rwanda and Burundi in Tanzania showed that an increase in food prices benefitted local producers, it <span class='card-underline'>hurt local net-consumers of food, often requiring them to rely heavily on food aid from organizations such as the UN World Food Programme</span> (Alix-Garcia & Saah 2010). 18 Further, overcrowding can lead to environmental degradation, which has become a serious concern in areas faced with a large influx of refugees<span class='card-underline'>. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The UNHCR concedes that refugee-affected areas may face increased issues of “deforestation, soil erosion, pollution, and depletion of water resources”</span></span> (“Refugees and the Environment” 2001). Jayna Smith notes that these environmental consequences also have spillover effects, stating that “In a refugee situation, excessive damage to the environment not only causes deterioration of refugees' welfare but also leads to competition with local communities over scarce resources” (Smith). <span class='card-underline'>This idea of competition can lead to a toxic “us against them” mentality, which is the kind of social strife</span> that the next paragraph of this paper seeks to address. <span class='card-underline'>A third concerning implication for refugee crises is</span> the disruptive negative economic impact <span class='card-underline'>that can emerge as a result of societal strife and potential civil conflict</span><span class='card-underline'>. On a broader level, refugees may increase the potential for internal conflict and war in the host nation</span> (Salehyan and Gleditsch 2006). For example, in the Horn of Africa, famine-driven refugee crises have often led to conflicting tribal and ethnic groups confined to a small geographic area (Salehyan 2008; Bakewell 2007; De Largy 1990). <span class='card-underline'>On a smaller scale than all-out war, refugees can create social tensions, especially in cases where the refugees have distinct religious, political, or ethnic identities from the citizens of the host country </span>(Tornkvsit 2015). This has been seen most recently in Sweden—a fairly homogeneous nation—through the torching of refugee shelters (Traub 2016). Aside from the refugee-native dynamic, <span class='card-underline'>societal strife grow between factions of the native population over how to deal with the refugees.</span> <span class='card-underline'>This can most recently be seen in the case of the European Union, where countries like Sweden and Germany have adhered to more of an open door policy</span>, while some, like Hungary, have completely closed off their borders (Traub 19 2016). This has resulted in a lack of burden-sharing that has frustrated the more open countries. In the process, these countries have violated the multilateral Schengen Agreement for a “borderless” Europe, potentially undermining the very credibility of the European Union as a unified institution (Traub 2016). As a perennially divisive issue, refugee crises are liable to cause this kind of social strife no matter where they occur<span class='card-underline'>. Even in countries where the refugees have roughly similar </span>(vis-à-vis the above Sweden example) <span class='card-underline'>identities to the citizens of the host country, resentment, and sometimes even violence, may still surface among the natives.</span> For example, Peshawar, a Pakistani city located near the border with Afghanistan, is home to thousands of Afghan refugees. Fleeing the Soviets, the Taliban, and the American war, these refugees have settled in nearby Pakistan. However, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>despite the close geographic proximity, shared languages, and similar religious backgrounds, Afghan refugees have been subject to police brutality, discrimination, and lack of access to basic medical resources. They’ve also faced backlash and blame for Taliban attacks</span></span>, such as the 2014 shooting at a Peshawar school that killed over 130 schoolchildren (Abid 2015; Saifi and Botehlo 2014). This potential for—and realization of—conflict and hostility can destabilize a host country and prevent meaningful economic development from gaining any traction: the World Bank estimates that any kind of extended civil conflict can deprive a developing country of up to the equivalent of 30 years of GDP growth (World Development Report 2011)</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'><span class='card-highlight'>Refugee’s bear a large cost on U.S. tax payers – status squo humanitarian aid is a better option and helps more than just a few</span> </div><div class='cite'><span class='card-highlight'>Krikorian</span> 20<span class='card-highlight'>15</span> [Mark Krikorian is a nationally recognized expert on immigration issues and has served as the Executive Director of the Center for Immigration Studies since 1995, 11-18-2015, “The Syrian Refugee Crisis and Its Impact on the Security of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program”, Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), https://cis.org/Testimony/Syrian-Refugee-Crisis-and-Its-Impact-Security-US-Refugee-Admissions-Program // wyo-rrt]</div><div class='card-body'><p>In addition to the security threats that refugee resettlement poses, any effort to extend humanitarian assistance to refugees must consider how effective it will be.

Clearly, whatever amount we allocate to refugee protection will provide for only a fraction of the people in need. <span class='card-underline'>Given these limitations on resources</span>, I submit that it is wrong — morally wrong — to use those resources to resettle one refugee here when we could help 12 closer to their home. There is little we can do to minimize the costs of resettling refugees. True, the private contractors the State Department pays to oversee the process are making a good living off of refugee resettlement, but reining them in won't make much difference. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Most of the costs come from social service</span></span><span class='card-underline'>s; according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, more than 90 percent of refugees from the Middle East receive food stamps and nearly three-quarters are on Medicaid or some other taxpayer-funded health care.</span><span class='card-underline'> </span>This dependence on taxpayer handouts should come as no surprise. Refugees arrive destitute and often traumatized. They have little education (those from the Middle East have an average of only 10.5 years of schooling), which means that even if they find work, it will pay little. And because they're poor – almost all have incomes only slightly above the poverty line – they pay little in taxes. Of course, we don't resettle refugees for economic reasons but for humanitarian ones. And since the goal is humanitarian, a wise steward must use his resources so that they generate the greatest humanitarian return. It's also true that refugees brought here will live better than those even in well-run refugee camps in the region. But <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the goal of refugee protection is to provide people adequate succor until they can return home, not maximize opportunity for a select few.</span></span></p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Backlog being reduced now, but the system is fragile </div><div class='cite'>Quesenberry 18</div><div class='card-body'><p>1-8-18 RAVEN QUESENBERRY for the Bipartisan Policy Center. “Slamming the Gavel on the Immigration Case Backlog” https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/slamming-the-gavel-on-the-immigration-case-backlog/</p><p>The Department of Homeland Security has recently released data on its immigration enforcement efforts during fiscal year (FY) 2017, noting a significant increase in the number of arrests of undocumented immigrants in the interior of the United States. However, the total number of deportations has not increased as much. In fact, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the total number of pending cases in immigration courts nationwide has increased steadily</span></span><span class='card-underline'> since 2006</span>, in a judicial backlog that immigration advocates and enforcement hawks alike agree is an inefficient system. In November 2017, the backlog ticked up to 650,411 pending immigration cases, a number which has increased nearly 25 percent in this fiscal year alone, and tripled since former President Barack Obama took office in 2009. As a result, the average number of days a case must currently wait to be heard is 691 days, although in several states such as Colorado and Illinois the waiting period to receive a final ruling is closer to 3 years. At this rate, the average immigration judge has a caseload of about 1,900 cases per year. For comparison, the average caseload of district court judges is around 440 cases per year. Although <span class='card-underline'>the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Department of Justice has increased its hiring</span></span><span class='card-underline'> this year, growing the corps of immigration judges to approximately 330, officials have indicated that it would take nearly 700 total judges before witnessing a significant shift in the number of pending cases. In </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>demonstrating its efforts to “slash the backlog</span></span><span class='card-underline'>,” the DOJ has cited </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>a 16 percent increase in efficiency</span></span><span class='card-underline'> of final decisions since FY2016. In a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee, Attorney General Jeff Sessions claimed that in the last 2 or 3 months, DOJ has “almost” not added to the immigration court backlog, and that by January 2018 the department will be reducing the backlog. </span>Despite these advances, to effectively reduce and manage its pending cases, the immigration court system must undergo much greater reform than simply hiring additional immigration judges. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>To address this</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>crippling </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>backlog, DOJ</span></span><span class='card-underline'>’s Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>has outlined a series of initiatives</span></span><span class='card-underline'> for FY2018.</span> <span class='card-underline'>These include initial pilot testing of the long-awaited electronic filing and adjudicating system, expanding the efforts of the Fraud and Abuse Prevention Program under a new fraud attorney and investigator to eliminate frivolous and fraudulent cases, hiring additional field supervisors to improve oversight and communication, establishing an EOIR Office of Policy, and introducing a streamlined hiring process which is expected to bring in 61 new immigration judges in early 2018. The Trump administration has also proposed establishing performance metrics and numerical quotas for immigration judges as part of its larger immigration reforms. </span>Despite backlash from both the advocacy community and the National Association of Immigration Judges claiming that these proposals threaten judicial independence, EOIR has not commented on reports that they would be imposing case-completion quotas on judges. In a November 2017 congressional hearing before the House Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security, Acting EOIR Director James McHenry did not reject claims that the EOIR would be using numerical and time-based quotas to assess immigration judges’ performance. Democratic members of the subcommittee pressed McHenry on the controversial nature of these completion quotas, arguing they would further exacerbate the challenges judges face in deciding more difficult cases. McHenry defended EOIR’s right to do so by referring to the quotas set by the Immigration Nationality Act as well as standards set by the Government Performance and Results Act in assessing the efficient completion of court rulings. He also affirmed that EOIR was “looking into” implementing numerical metrics for individual judges’ performance with unions like the National Association of Immigration Judges. In the weeks after the subcommittee hearing, Sessions issued a memo publicly affirming the DOJ’s emphasis on increased productivity. The memo criticized unnecessary delays in case rulings, and encouraged EOIR personnel to prioritize “timely and efficient adjudication of immigration cases.”</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Increasing asylum applications overwhelm immigration courts, creates massive backlog.</div><div class='cite'>Andrew Becker / June 4, 2017 Reveal “Nearly 600,000 immigration cases clog courts, study finds” https://www.revealnews.org/blog/nearly-600000-immigration-cases-clog-courts-study-finds/ Becker's reporting has appeared in The Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, Newsweek/The Daily Beast and on National Public Radio and PBS/FRONTLINE, among others.

(JM)</div><div class='card-body'><p>Racked with a backlog approaching 600,000 cases, the nation’s 58 immigration courts over the last decade have taken longer to rule on deportations, asylum claims and other matters despite hiring more judges and more than doubling their annual budget, according to a new Government Accountability Office report<span class='card-underline'>. </span>Government auditors said that the Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review, which oversees the immigration court system, has been plagued by inefficiencies<span class='card-underline'>,</span> its own foot-dragging in hiring new judges and an increasingly complex and changing legal landscape spurred by recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions and lawsuits brought by immigrants facing deportation. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Between 2006 and 2015 the court system’s caseload more than doubled</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, growing steadily each year under the Obama administration, while judges completed nearly one-third fewer cases, the report states</span>. The study was conducted at the request of congressional Republicans and Democrats. That spells bad news for President Donald Trump as he pushes his central political agenda to crack down on illegal immigration and beef up border security. The report underscores that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the already bogged-down immigration courts could become a major obstacle</span></span><span class='card-underline'> to his objective of removing 2 million to 3 million people from the country</span>. But the good news for immigrants is that <span class='card-underline'>judges are ordering deportation for a smaller percentage of immigrants, down to 52 percent in 2015 compared to 77 percent</span> in 2006. Judges are also more frequently ending cases, or ruling in an immigrant’s favor. Overall, judges now decide fewer cases based on the actual merits of arguments than they did a decade ago. <span class='card-underline'>Despite smaller individual caseloads for judges, immigration hearings are being scheduled years into the future</span>, including five years out in at least one court, according to the report. Such <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>delays a</span></span><span class='card-underline'>lso </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>put a strain on immigrants’ legal rights by making it more difficult to produce witnesses or documents in their defense,</span></span><span class='card-underline'> potentially jeopardizing their legitimate claims to avoid deportation. Sometimes people who may have had a good claim against deportation lost their eligibility over time because their circumstances changed</span>, the report states. In other instances, immigrants who don’t have a solid argument to stay in the country avoid deportation longer because their hearings are delayed. “The effects of the case backlog are significant and wide-ranging, from <span class='card-underline'>some respondents waiting years to have their cases heard to immigration judges being able to spend less time considering cases</span>,” the report concludes, adding that technology could help the court tackle the backlog. A surge of unaccompanied children arriving at the border starting in 2014 has also exacerbated the challenges faced by immigration judges. Those cases, which usually take longer because of different legal options, are given priority over matters that may be resolved faster. The median number of days to complete a deportation case, accounting for nearly all of the court system’s caseload between 2006 and 2015, grew 700 percent from 42 days to 336 days. Auditors concluded that those <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>delays are also due to judges delaying decisions more by continuing cases</span></span>. Continuances are grouped into about 70 different categories, including more time needed because of illness of an immigrant, their witness or attorney, delays in background investigations or security checks, and insufficient time to complete a hearing. While apprehensions of border jumpers have ebbed to their lowest point in decades, <span class='card-underline'>immigration enforcement jumped 37.6 percent in the first 100 days of the Trump administration compared to the same time period a year befor</span>e, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. <span class='card-underline'>Deportations, however, were down about 12 percent. Although the Trump administration has called for hiring dozens of additional judges, the mounting caseload could be further intensified by a wave of judges retiring. Almost 40 percent of immigration judges are now eligible for retirement. The office’s budget is about $440 million for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, up from $199 million in 2005</span>. The study also explored the question of whether an independent immigration court could better handle deportation cases, appeals, immigration-related discrimination complaints and other matters than the current system run by the Justice Department. The association that represents immigration judges for years has advocated for such independence, but has not persuaded a federal judicial panel to make the change. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who earlier this year directed prosecutors to prioritize immigration offenses for prosecution, announced recently the appointment of an acting director to take over the 1,000-person immigration office. James McHenry, who had served as deputy associate attorney general with a focus on immigration litigation, replaces Juan Osuna, who ran the office for much of the Obama administration.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Clogged courts forces waiting immigrants into detention centers indefinitely, regardless of their innocence/legitimacy</div><div class='cite'> Jonathan Blitzer June 20, 2017 The New Yorker, “What Will Trump Do with Half a Million Backlogged Immigration Cases?” https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-will-trump-do-with-half-a-million-backlogged-immigration-cases Jonathan Blitzer is a staff writer at The New Yorker.

(JM)</div><div class='card-body'><p>In April, Attorney General Jeff Sessions travelled to Nogales, Arizona, to make an announcement. “This is the Trump era,” he said. “The lawlessness, the abdication of the duty to enforce our immigrations laws, and the catch-and-release practices of old are over.” While his tone was harsh, and many of the proposals he outlined were hostile to immigrants, he detailed one idea that even some of his critics support: the hiring of more immigration judges. <span class='card-underline'>U.S. immigration courts are facing a backlog of over half a million cases—and each one, on average, takes almost two years to close. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>These delays mean that everyone</span></span><span class='card-underline'> from asylum seekers to green-card holders </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>faces extended stays in detention</span></span><span class='card-underline'> while awaiting rulings. Speaking about the problem, one immigration judge recently told the Times, “</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The courts as a whole lose credibility.”</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>Much of the backlog can be traced back to the Obama Administration, when spending on immigration enforcement went up, while Congress dramatically limited funds for hiring more judges. The number of pending cases grew from a hundred and sixty-seven thousand, in 2008, to five hundred and sixty thousand, in 2017, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse. The broader trend, though, goes back farther. Since the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, in 2002, <span class='card-underline'>the increase in resources allocated for border security and immigration policing has always significantly outpaced funding for the courts</span>. (Immigration courts are part of the Department of Justice.) As more and more people have been arrested, detained, and ordered deported, the courts have remained understaffed and underfunded. “We’ve always been an afterthought,” Dana Leigh Marks, the president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, told me. Roughly three hundred judges nationwide are responsible for the entire immigration caseload, and hiring is slow—filling a vacancy typically takes about two years, according to the Government Accountability Office. In Nogales, Sessions said that he would try to streamline the hiring process. But until that happens the Administration has been relocating judges to areas where they’re deemed most necessary. “We have already surged twenty-five immigration judges to detention centers along the border,” Sessions said, as if talking about military troop levels. Since March, New York City, for example, has had at least eight of its twenty-nine immigration judges reassigned, at least temporarily, to Texas and Louisiana, WNYC has reported. But in relocating them <span class='card-underline'>the federal government is exacerbating the city’s own significant backlog: roughly eighty thousand pending cases and an average delay of six hundred and twenty-five days per case. “</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Letting political forces impact the courts’ docketing strategy disrupts our system</span></span><span class='card-underline'>,” Marks said. “The temporary assignments to the border courts have been extremely problematic. There’s no one to backfill those slots.”</span> The situation reminded her of a move made by the Obama Administration in 2014, when tens of thousands of unaccompanied children showed up at the U.S. border seeking asylum. The Department of Justice sent immigration judges to the border states to handle the sudden spike in cases, leaving their home states in the lurch. “We cleared the desks,” Marks said. “We pushed back cases that were ready to be heard, and we heard cases that weren’t ready to be brought to completion. There’s only so fast you can go and still allow due process.” The Trump Administration’s significant enforcement push is putting another sudden strain on the system. So far this year, federal immigration authorities have made forty per cent more arrests than they did at an equivalent point in 2016, and <span class='card-underline'>the Department of Homeland Security has eliminated all the guidelines for how Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ice) is supposed to prioritize the people it targets for arrest. “The largest federal law-enforcement agency in the country, which is seeking more funding and less accountability, is given carte blanche to go after who it wants</span>,” Avideh Moussavian, a lawyer at the National Immigration Law Center, said of ice and Customs and Border Protection. “It’s creating this ballooning problem of subjecting so many more people to detention, <span class='card-underline'>with no interest from the federal government in providing resources to insure that they have fair proceedings.”</span> Immigration proceedings are civil matters rather than criminal ones, so <span class='card-underline'>the protections generally afforded to criminal defendants don’t apply to individuals with cases before immigration judges.</span> If a defendant wins in a criminal case, the government can’t appeal. Nor can authorities hold a person in prison after an exonerating ruling. In immigration court, however, <span class='card-underline'>ice can appeal if a judge decides to close a case, and often </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>an individual will remain in detention while that process runs its course</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>.</span> The Supreme Court is currently weighing a case in which a large class of litigants are seeking mandatory bond hearings every six months for anyone in immigrant detention. As it stands now, <span class='card-underline'>individuals are held indefinitely while they wait</span><span class='card-underline'> for a judge to rule on their situation, whether it’s an asylum claim or a contested deportation order. (Being detained doesn’t mean their cases are wea</span>k; according to Justice Department figures, roughly twenty per cent of all deportation cases resolved in 2016—some twenty thousand cases—ended in the immigrants’ favor, with the deportation orders being dropped.) <span class='card-underline'>In immigration cases</span>, Anthony Enriquez, a lawyer with the Immigrant Defense Project, told me, <span class='card-underline'>people “wear the same jumpsuits as criminal defendants. They’re put in the same cells. Still, they don’t have the same protections.”</span> Earlier this month, in the Bronx, I met <span class='card-underline'>Christian Yarleque, a forty-seven-year-old lawful permanent resident who came to the U.S. from Peru three decades ago, when he was fourteen. In 2008, he was arrested for drug possession, a misdemeanor</span>, and he served six months in jail. One morning, seven years after his release, <span class='card-underline'>ice agents showed up at his apartment, in the Bronx, with a deportation order.</span> He let the agents inside because they told him they were with the police. “They deceived me,” he said. When they arrested him, he told them that he’d already served his time. “Not with us,” they responded. (An ice spokesperson told me, “ice deportation officers will identify themselves appropriately on each arrest.”) <span class='card-underline'>After three and a half months in detention, an immigration judge heard the case and decided to close it, effectively quashing ice’s order of deportation. ice decided to mount an appeal. Because of the court backlog, it took more than a year before another judge ruled on the appeal, and though the judge set bond, it was well beyond what Yarleque could afford to pay. During that time, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Yarleque</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>remained in a detention center</span>, in Newark, while his family struggled—he had been the family’s primary breadwinner. Each week, his wife came to visit him, bringing him money for food and phone time, so that he could speak to his kids regularly. On Tuesdays, ice officers came to meet with inmates who were considering accepting a deportation order just to escape detention. “I thought about throwing in the towel at one point,” he said. “I had no idea when I’d be able to get out.” Yarleque was comparatively fortunate: through a program called the New York Immigrant Family Unity Project, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>he had a lawyer. </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Most immigrants in detention across the country don’t</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span><span class='card-underline'> One study, done by an appellate judge, in 2011, found that roughly twenty per cent of immigrant detainees with lawyers won their cases, compared to just three per cent of immigrant detainees without lawyers. </span>In April, after almost two years in detention, Yarleque won his appeal, and the judge ordered ice to drop the case. He was released, and is now back in the Bronx with his family; soon he’ll begin a new job, as a janitor at a local hospital. He can start work just as soon as D.H.S. returns his green card. When I asked him when that would be, he turned to his lawyer, who had joined us for the conversation. “It’s hard to know,” he said. “<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>There are bureaucratic delays.”</span></span></p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Privately run, for-profit detention centers present deplorable conditions for immigrants awaiting trial by utilizing opaque fraudulent contracts issued by ICE – turns case</div><div class='cite'>Robin Urevich June 28, 2018 Capital and Main, “The Rise and Fall of an Immigration Detention Empire” https://capitalandmain.com/the-rise-and-fall-of-an-immigration-detention-empire-0628 Robin Urevich is a journalist and radio reporter whose work has appeared on NPR, Marketplace, the San Francisco Chronicle and the Las Vegas Sun. (JM)</div><div class='card-body'><p><span class='card-underline'>In 2016 two immigrant detainees died after receiving care at facilities run by Emerald Correctional Management, a small Louisiana-based for-profit prison firm that at the time managed detention centers for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. </span>A Russian asylum seeker, 46-year old Igor Zyazin, died of a heart attack several days after medical staff at Emerald’s San Luis Regional Detention Facility near Yuma, Arizona failed to adequately treat his severe chest pain. (See “Could an Undocumented Russian’s Life Have Been Saved?”) Olubunmi Joshua, 54, passed away after enduring eight months of medical errors and treatment delays at the Rolling Plains Detention Center in Haskell, Texas. (See “Anatomy of an ICE Death.”) Emerald operated three ICE detention centers and a county jail before going out of business in early 2017. A Capital & Main investigation has found <span class='card-underline'>Emerald took in millions of government dollars as it skimped on essential expenses and damaged detainees, its own employees and, likely, taxpayers while ICE officials looked the other way. Like other for-profit prison companies, Emerald did business with ICE through secretive no-bid contracts using city governments as middlemen. Critics charge these contracts allow ICE to avoid legal responsibility—for deaths, injuries and sexual abuse that occur in detention—and play a role in the government’s see-no-evil approach to detention abuses. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Since 2003, </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>183 detainees have died in ICE custody</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>. The federal government depends on profit-driven prison companies,</span></span><span class='card-underline'> including smaller firms like Emerald and corrections giants, such as CoreCivic and the Geo Group, to run its sprawling, 200-plus-prison detention network. At Emerald, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>chaos reigned in the form of wage theft, poor medical care and crowded, unsanitary conditions. But ICE officials didn’t intervene</span></span>, and it’s rare that it does at other facilities with serious problems. Between 2010 and 2017, just two of more than 200 detention centers received failing or “deficient” ratings from ICE inspectors. The government’s failure to act against these facilities is partly the result of an insatiable hunger for lockups, said Mark Fleming, an attorney with the National Immigrant Justice Center. Fleming contended that without the capacity to warehouse thousands of immigrants in facilities run by private prison companies, the government would face “an existential crisis.” In a rush to create detention space, ICE has used opaque noncompetitive contracts called Intergovernmental Service Agreements to quickly bring beds online. Now, as ICE seeks to expand family detention, it is likely to turn to IGSAs just as it did in 2014, when a wave of Central American children and families sought asylum in the U.S. It is reportedly planning to house families at the Fort Bliss Army base in Texas. Critics argue that <span class='card-underline'>the sole purpose of some of these agreements is to avoid public protest and federal contracting rules that officially are aimed at ensuring transparency and avoiding overpayment by the government. </span>Immigration detention has expanded fivefold in the past 23 years, and with the Trump administration’s deportation surge, is growing larger. But when Emerald got its start in 1997, the immigration detention system was just ramping up, and immigration detention contracts were a reliable source of business for the company – even as Emerald’s blunders were getting it ousted from county jails and knocked out of the running for state and local bids to operate jails and prisons nationwide. The company drummed up some of its business by convincing small towns that jails and prisons would revive their dying economies. In the 1980s and ’90s, Raywood J. LeMaire, one of the company’s four partners, learned firsthand as the five-term Vermilion Parish sheriff that <span class='card-underline'>there was money to be made in renting out jail beds to relieve state-prison overcrowding</span>. Louisiana sheriffs like LeMaire generated money and power for their offices by housing state prisoners in their jails—often on the cheap and in poor conditions. “As long as you didn’t feed them too well – grits and beans and cold bologna — you could make some money,” alleged Keith Nordyke, a Louisiana attorney who has long represented prisoners. Asked about his partnership in Emerald, LeMaire, now in his late 70s, told Capital & Main, “I got out of it in January,” before refusing to talk further and hanging up the phone. Emerald’s other partners, Glenn Hebert, who also once worked for the Vermilion Parish Sheriff’s Office, Clay Lee, W.T. Lee and former CEO Steve Afeman couldn’t be reached for comment. Hull Youngblood, an attorney who represented the company, didn’t return calls or answer emails. Red flags had warned of trouble inside the company at least since 2003, when Emerald took over operations at the Rolling Plains Detention Center from another private firm. “We saw things go to hell,” said Judy Morrell, who worked as a guard at Rolling Plains. Food for detainees was scarce, she alleged: “They would feed these people chicken bones and rice. If you don’t feed them, they’ve got to get money to buy [from] the commissary.” Morrell noted that Emerald profited from its in-prison store. “But you take people who didn’t have money, by God, they didn’t eat. They’d get to stealing and thieving.” Now 70, Morrell said that when she started with Emerald she knew how prisons were supposed to run, having put in five years with the Texas prison system. Morrell publicly complained about bad food and overcrowding, and quit her job in 2004. Federal officials were quoted in local media at the time as pledging to investigate her accusations. Three years later, a habeas corpus petition filed on behalf of five members of a Palestinian family alleged they were the victims of sexual harassment, inadequate medical treatment, excessive use of solitary confinement and religious intolerance. Over the years at Rolling Plains, Texas Commission on Jail Standards <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>inspectors found repeated incidents of overcrowding, unsafe and unsanitary conditions, failure of medical staff to follow doctors’ orders, understaffing and failure of staff to perform regular checks on detainees</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>.</span> (ICE inspectors became more critical of the facility only in its later years, noting dozens of violations of its standards but, based on available inspection reports, never appears to have given Rolling Plains an overall deficient rating.) Cases of egregious neglect by Emerald have included: — The 2016 suicide of a 77-year-old county inmate, Kennie Moore, who hanged himself using his boxer shorts as a noose. — Emerald’s 2012 ousting, by a Louisiana sheriff, from the Riverbend Detention Center when his officers discovered a mother lode of drugs, cellphones and shanks during a shakedown. — A lawsuit filed by workers at the West Texas Detention Facility against Emerald that alleged they were forced to work off the clock and weren’t paid for overtime; it was eventually settled out of court. By 2016 the company had abandoned or been fired from more detention contracts than it maintained. As early as 2005, local and state governments in Florida, Vermont and Texas began to turn down the company’s bids to house prisoners or build facilities, citing its record. What’s more, the prison building boom was winding down as states tried to reduce their prison populations. But ICE was Emerald’s ace in the hole. In 2016, Emerald finished construction on the $60 million Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, Texas and began managing the 700-bed facility for the agency. Prairieland replaced Rolling Plains, whose location was too remote for adequate staffing and transportation of detainees, said one former ICE official. <span class='card-underline'>Perhaps ICE could overlook the company’s checkered history because technically the federal agency wasn’t in business with Emerald</span>. Emerald’s contract was not with the government, but rather with Alvarado, a town of 4,000 near Fort Worth, which has no actual role in running the detention center. ICE spokesman Carl Rusnok didn’t address Capital & Main’s questions about whether it reviewed Emerald’s record before approving it as the operator of the Prairieland facility. He wrote in an email that new facilities contracts must meet the latest ICE standards, which require that all facilities “vigorously investigate all claims of abuse, and mistreatment of detainees by staff and other detainees.” Like all Intergovernmental Service Agreements, <span class='card-underline'>the deal was made without the transparency that federal contracting rules dictate</span>. ICE signed the agreement with Alvarado city officials, but city officials have no role in operating Prairieland. “If you told me today that I’d have to start running the jail tomorrow, that wouldn’t work,” said Rick Holden, Alvarado’s city manager. “We’re not set up for that.” Holden is new on the job, having arrived in early May. Still, he said that after six weeks in office he hadn’t visited Prairieland. “We don’t manage it from here. Nobody out there reports to me,” Holden said. “ICE is the agency that has the facility.” If Holden would find it daunting to manage a detention center in his backyard, imagine the task that would face city officials in Eloy, Arizona. On paper, Eloy manages the 2,400-bed South Texas Family Residential Center, which is located more than 900 miles away in Dilley, Texas. But last February, the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general found that Eloy doesn’t actually run the detention center, and didn’t even negotiate the agreement with ICE. Private prison operator CoreCivic did. CoreCivic appears to have engineered the whole deal by asking the Eloy City Council to modify an existing ICE contract to also include the South Texas facility. The town of Eloy was simply a middleman that was paid more than $400,000 annually by CoreCivic for the job, the inspector general concluded. The IG noted that a lack of accountability is built into this particular contracting arrangement: “Because ICE’s agreement and legal relationship is with the city of Eloy, CCA’s [Core Civic’s] performance is effectively insulated from government scrutiny.” The absurdity of a small city like Eloy overseeing a massive detention center in another state may be apparent, but the basics of its contract don’t differ much from a number of other IGSAs between ICE and local governments: Cities are routinely paid fees to act as middlemen between ICE and private companies. Still, for the most part, the inspector general’s office limited its criticism to the Eloy agreement. But it did express its disapproval of ICE’s handling of IGSAs in general. “<span class='card-underline'>ICE has no assurance that it executed detention center contracts in the best interest of the Federal Government, taxpayers, or detainees</span>,” the report observed. Eloy isn’t the only city supposedly overseeing detention operations from afar. In California, the city of Adelanto, in San Bernardino county, signed a 2014 agreement to provide guard services for a family detention center in New Mexico for a year. The services were provided by the for-profit prison firm, the GEO Group, not the city of Adelanto. The small San Joaquin Valley town of McFarland has a long-standing IGSA with ICE to operate the Mesa Verde Detention Center in Bakersfield, nearly 30 miles away. The legitimate purpose of IGSAs is to allow government agencies to fill urgent needs by piggybacking onto services a local government already offers. In many cases, ICE does exactly that by signing an agreement with a local sheriff to rent beds in a county jail. However, in other cases, ICE has used IGSAs only to rapidly bring detention facilities online by skirting federal contracting rules, which require an open bidding process that ensures transparency and competition. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>About a third of all immigrant detainees are housed under these sort of agreements between ICE and cities</span></span>. Attorney Mark Fleming believes these are sham contracts, especially in cases where the city doesn’t even own the facility, much less operates it. “<span class='card-underline'>These are fraudulent contracts to allow ICE to float money to a private company to avoid federal procurement laws</span>,” Fleming said. “That’s a fraudulent contract because the locality has nothing to offer.” For example, the Adelanto Detention Center in San Bernardino County is operated under an IGSA between the city of Adelanto and ICE. The city, however, doesn’t run the detention center. The for-profit GEO Group does.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Backlog stabilizing now </div><div class='cite'>Sacchetti 17</div><div class='card-body'><p>11-3-17 Maria Sacchetti covers immigration for The Washington Post.

The administration has reversed Obama-era policies that allowed prosecutors to indefinitely postpone low-priority cases, which the Justice Department officials said allowed some immigrants to delay "inevitable" deportations. In other cases, they said, immigrants who deserved to win their cases were delayed for years because of the backlog<span class='card-underline'>. The immigration court backlog has tripled since 2009,</span> the year former president Obama took office, to more than 630,000 cases in October. "<span class='card-underline'>That is what this administration is committed to, getting this done right, ensuring that we're never in this place again</span>," a Justice Department official said.

Arrests and deportations from the interior of the United States are rising sharply, and the Trump administration has ended Obama-era protections for some undocumented immigrants, including 690,000 undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United States as children. By Monday, the Trump administration is also expected to say if it will renew temporary protected status for thousands of longtime immigrants from Honduras and Nicaragua whose permits expire next year. The Justice Department officials said they are no longer widely using certain protections for undocumented immigrants, including a tool known as prosecutorial discretion that allowed the government to set aside low-priority deportation cases. DOJ officials criticized immigration lawyers, saying they "have purposely used tactics designed to delay" immigration cases. As of 2012, the officials said, there were an average of four continuances for each case before the court. Gregory Chen, director of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said the administration's plan to cut the backlog would "undermine judicial independence" in the immigration courts. "This administration has been extremely hostile toward the judiciary and the independence of immigration judges, as well as other judges," Chen said. Speeding up cases depends partly on congressional funding. It also rests partly on the actions of immigration judges, who have expressed concerns about due process for immigrants, many of whom are facing deportation to some of the world's most violent countries. Immigrants are not entitled to a government-appointed lawyer in these courts and often handle cases on their own. The Justice officials would not comment on reports that they will impose case-completion quotas on judges, which raised an outcry from the judges' union. But the officials said they would give judges clear standards to complete cases and add more supervisors. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Officials</span></span><span class='card-underline'> say they are </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>already seeing results from efforts this year to improve efficiency</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. From February to September, judges ordered 78,767 people to leave the country, a 33 percent jump over the same period in 2016. The total number of final decisions, which includes some immigrants who won their cases, is 100,921. </span></p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Rise in credible fear applications creates backlogs in other parts of the asylum process, clogging immigration courts</div><div class='cite'>Scialabba and Chaffetz December 12, 2013, Congress of the US, “ASYLUM ABUSE: IS IT OVERWHELMING OUR BORDERS?” Serial No. 113–56 Speaking at a a House Judiciary Committee hearing.

U.S. border officials are trying to work through the backlog, but they can go only as fast as migrants can be processed and moved from temporary holding cells to immigration detention. </span>An official with U.S. Customs and Border Protection said the agency remains committed to meeting the care and safety needs of people in custody, and is working actively with partners, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to resolve the backup. “There are potentially a number of reasons causing the San Diego area ports of entry to reach capacity; we do not have a definitive reason to offer at this time,” the official added. <span class='card-underline'>Because of the backlog, close to 100 migrants lined up</span> last week in the plaza outside the walkway that leads to PedWest, the pedestrian border crossing that opened earlier this year, Tijuana media outlets reported. <span class='card-underline'>Migrants slept in line, afraid of losing their places and having to wait longer for CBP to process them</span>. Then, Mexican officials told them they couldn’t stay in the plaza. On Monday of last week, about 25 migrants were jailed overnight for waiting in the plaza outside the port, according to several Eritrean migrants. In the days since, some found refuge in Tijuana’s migrant shelters, particularly the Casa del Migrante. Each morning, they return to the port to ask if there is room in CBP’s processing area. When they’re turned away, they walk over to a nearby plaza and wait until shelters open for the night. “We can’t give up. We don’t have option,” said Mesfin Tesfaldet, a 33-year-old man from Eritrea seeking asylum in the U.S., who has been waiting to be processed for at least a week. He was again shooed out of El Chaparral plaza on Friday along with about a dozen others from Eritrea and Cameroon. <span class='card-underline'>When someone arrives at a port without documents for entry, CBP officials interview that person, take photographs and fingerprints and check law enforcement databases for records. If that person reports being afraid to go back to his or her home country, CBP is required by law to transfer that migrant to other federal agencies for a potential asylum case. Most of the asylum process happens once the person has been transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement — or ICE — custody, and back-ups in that transfer system can leave CBP with limited space in its temporary holding cells at the border. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Large groups of migrants arriving at once can</span></span><span class='card-underline'> also </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>clog the system</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. </span>In the fall of 2016, San Diego’s ports were overwhelmed by thousands of Haitian migrants. In partnership with Mexican officials, CBP established a ticketing system that scheduled appointments for migrants to be processed. As of November, the most recent data available from CBP, arrivals hadn’t reached the levels of the wave of arriving Haitians. In October 2016, <span class='card-underline'>more than 6,000 people came to San Diego’s ports of entry asking to come in despite not having documents</span> permitting entry to the U.S. <span class='card-underline'>That number included asylum seekers — CBP does not distinguish between those seeking asylum and other “inadmissibles” in its data collection</span>. (In addition to asylum seekers, inadmissibles are those looking for better economic opportunities or anyone else who has asked to enter the U.S. at a port without the proper documents.) In November 2017, the number of people deemed inadmissible was 2,824, more than double the low of 1,313 reached in March of this year. Under current policy, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>asylum seekers are </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>detained by ICE until they get results from credible fear interviews</span></span>, which determine the likelihood that they will win their cases in immigration court. If asylum seekers don’t pass the interviews, they are sent back to their home countries. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>If they do pass, </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>many stay in detention for the remainder of their cases</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>, which can take a year or more to finish</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>. Some</span> are released from detention on parole or by paying bond while they wait for their turns to tell their stories to immigration judges. Asylum seekers, like refugees, must prove that they’ve been persecuted or fear persecution because of their race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group. Tesfaldet said he fled Eritrea to Sudan after he was jailed for his political views. In Sudan, he said, he couldn’t go to a refugee camp because the two governments were working together to send Eritreans back to their home country. He hid for several years before finding a way to fly to Brazil. From there, he followed a grueling and potentially fatal migrant trail up to Tijuana. “It was hard. It’s very bad, that jungle. Many people is dying, especially in the river,” Tesfaldet said. “We sacrificed ourselves already. We don’t expect to have a problem when we get here.” He saw children swept away by the water at river crossings — pulled right out of their mothers’ arms, he said. He left his 5-year-old daughter in hiding in Sudan while he made the journey because he didn’t want to risk losing her on the way. He hopes that if he is able to win his asylum case in the U.S., he’ll be able to bring her to join him. He thinks about his daughter every day, he said. He doesn’t care where he lives in the U.S. as long as he is allowed in. “I want safe. I want peaceful,” Tesfaldet said. Some of the migrants from African countries expressed frustration that they were the ones left outside after Mexican officials intervened. “We are human beings,” said one man from Eritrea. “They don’t respect. I’m feeling racism here, a big discrimination here. We don’t want to be here in Mexico. Our target, our way is USA.” When Tijuana media first reported the line of migrants, many of those interviewed were Mexican asylum seekers fleeing gang violence in other parts of the country. By Friday, most of them did not appear outside the port. An official from Mexico’s immigration agency told a Mexican media outlet that his agency had asked CBP to find a way to take in more people because of concerns about how migrant children waiting in line could be affected when temperatures drop overnight. The group of Eritreans and Cameroonians outside El Chaparral on Friday said many of those who didn’t make it into the U.S. had traveled on to Mexicali or even Texas to try at other ports. Friday afternoon, several of the remaining Eritrean men decided to try their luck in Mexicali as well.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Clogged courts turn USCIS into an enforcement agency, creates more clog and deportations</div><div class='cite'> Joshua Breisblatt July 9, 2018 Immigration Impact, “USCIS Is Slowly Being Morphed Into an Immigration Enforcement Agency” http://immigrationimpact.com/2018/07/09/uscis-guidance-immigration-benefit/ Joshua Breisblatt is a Senior Policy Analyst at the American Immigration Council, where he focuses on immigration enforcement, immigration courts and due process, and border issues.

The NTA is issued by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and USCIS. It must be served to the individual and presented to the immigration court for removal proceedings to be triggered. When someone receives an NTA, they must appear before an immigration judge at an assigned date and location to determine if they are eligible to remain in the country legally or should be removed. NTAs are traditionally issued under certain situations, such as terminations of conditional permanent residence, referrals of asylum cases, and positive credible fear findings. Beginning immediately, NTAs will also be issued by USCIS: For denials of an initial application or re-registration for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) or a withdrawal of TPS when the applicant has no other lawful immigration status. When fraud, misrepresentation, or evidence of abuse of public benefit programs is part of an individual’s record, even if the application or petition has been denied for other reasons. When someone is under investigation or arrested for any crime, regardless of a conviction, if the application is denied and the person is removable. When USCIS issues an unfavorable decision and the individual is not lawfully present in the United States. A second policy memorandum issued at the same time as the new NTA guidance makes applicants for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) the exception to this new NTA policy. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>This move essentially ends all prosecutorial discretion</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, a key tool used by law enforcement and prosecutors all over the country to effectively prioritize cases</span>. In the past, immigration agencies used prosecutorial discretion when deciding under what circumstances to issue NTAs. Past leaders of USCIS have issued memos against the practice of <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>widespread</span></span><span class='card-underline'> NTA </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>issuance, noting it was impractical, would divert scarce resources, create longer wait times, and clog the immigration courts</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. Further, denials of immigration benefits applications are often reversed upon reconsideration or appeal. This means that thousands of cases that will ultimately be approved will be needlessly tossed onto the dockets of an already overburdened court system. If an immigration benefit request is approved on appeal, the individual must then seek termination of proceedings, which consumes even more court resources.</span> With over 700,000 cases already in the court backlog, it’s inconceivable for the agency to manage many thousands more. This new NTA policy is both overbroad and short-sighted, not taking into account the practical effects on government resources or the chilling effect it will have on noncitizens needing to apply for or renew benefits. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Our complex immigration system will become </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>even more inefficient, burdensome, and confusing</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>.</span></p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>In an effort to address backlogs, the Trump administration looks to revoke due process for immigrants and asylum seekers, opening the door for deportation without trial.</div><div class='cite'> LAURA ZIEGLER • JAN 23, 2018 High Plains Public Radio, “Immigration Court Backlog Raises Due Process Concerns In The Era Of Trump” http://hppr.org/post/immigration-court-backlog-raises-due-process-concerns-era-trump Laura Ziegler began her career at KCUR as a reporter more than 20 years ago.

He now lives in mid-Missouri with his mother and sister. Honduras is one of the most violent countries in the world. Rivas says he’s been targeted multiple times by violent Honduran gangs. “I thought I could be killed, I couldn't finish my studies,” he says through an interpreter. “I wanted my mom to send for me [from the U.S] ... because they came and looked for me many times." After being detained by immigration authorities, Rivas was released and told to show up at the immigration court closest to where he’d be staying, which was Kansas City. Like more than half the people facing immigration charges, Rivas couldn’t afford an attorney. A friend accompanied him to court, where he said he was always confused. “I never really understood. ... The only reason I do now is because I have a lawyer,” he says. Rivas had a police report to prove he’d gone to authorities in Honduras. Doing that was risky in Honduras; Rivas says he's certain that's why he was targeted by his attackers. But he never gave his report to the immigration judge because he says the judge didn’t ask him for it. After several hearings, none lasting more than a few minutes, his asylum request was denied. Facing deportation, he saved up money to hire a lawyer to appeal. Immigration court The immigration court where Rivas' case was heard is in a Crown Center office building in Kansas City that houses the law firm of Lathrop & Gage and other businesses. It's about two hours from where Rivas lives. On a recent morning in January, the nondescript court's small lobby is packed with others also facing removal from the United States. Security guards pass mothers and children, couples or individuals through a metal detector. A handful of lawyers, readily identifiable by their dress and demeanor, escort their clients into the small courtrooms. Recording in the courtroom isn't permitted. But if you could record, you’d hear Judge Jayme Salinardi or one of the two other immigration judges whipping through their dockets. The mostly first-time hearings last no more than three minutes each. Almost all are postponed — some for years. “Please state your name,” Judge Salinardi asks for the record. “Is Spanish your first language?” If so, he says, a translator will be provided. He verifies a few facts about the case. “Will you be available on August 18th of 2021?” <span class='card-underline'>The immigration courts — there are more than 50 nationwide — have had big backlogs since well before Trump took office. But immigration judges and lawyers agree the problem has only gotten worse in the last year.</span> Pending cases nationwide increased from 516,031 in fiscal 2016 to 629,051 in fiscal 2017, according to TRAC, a database research center at Syracuse University. Right now, the backlog stands at 658,728. “This is a new era. This the era of Trump,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced last year in remarks at the U.S. Mexican border. <span class='card-underline'>President Trump’s executive order expands the authority of immigration officials to deport non-U.S. citizens at the border. It also limits the discretion of prosecutors to prioritize cases as more or less urgent and takes away the ability of judges to close some cases temporarily to make room for more pressing ones. </span>The push to move more cases through the immigration court pipeline concerns Genevra Alberti with The Clinic at Sharma-Crawford Attorneys at Law. She's one of a handful of pro bono immigration attorneys in the Kansas City area. “<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Due process is apparently not really a concern of the Trump administration</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>,”</span> she says. “<span class='card-underline'>If (non-citizens) are not being given due process of the law, they’re not being given a meaningful opportunity to present their cases and potentially stay here in the United States."</span> She adds: “So not only are they picking up more and more people who generally would have fallen under the radar in the past, but also <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>people who have had their cases administratively closed and put on the back burner. And courts are being suddenly asked to put them back on their docket just because</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.”</span> For many people who appear in immigration court, the stakes couldn’t be higher. Yet more and more of them have no legal representation. Like Rivas, they can’t afford an attorney or don’t have the time to find one. Pro-bono lawyers are maxed out. Alberti herself has 175 cases right now. Many of those who represent themselves find the convoluted tangle of U.S. immigration laws confusing. Bradley Jenkins, a pro bono attorney with the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, says there’s a good reason for that. “Immigration law is complex,” he says. “It’s more complex than the tax code.” “Many conscientious judges are very worried about getting it right and afraid of getting it wrong (with) these pressures to get through increased cases,” he adds. Justice Department spokesman Devin O’Malley says the administration inherited a massive number of deportation cases. “In 2010, longstanding immigration court benchmarks for non-detained cases were abruptly abandoned, and since that time — perhaps not coincidentally — the caseload has tripled," O’Malley explained in an email. Prioritizing cases that "can be resolved more quickly in favor of cases that often take longer to complete" will reduce the caseload, he says. The administration also is bringing back previously abandoned performance goals for courts and judges, another way to address the backlog, O'Malley says. He describes the administration's measures as "a series of common-sense reforms that aim to reduce the so-called "backlog" by realigning the agency towards completing cases, increasing both productivity and capacity and changing policies that lead to inefficiencies and waste." Retired immigration Judge John O’Malley, a former Jackson County judge who became the first immigration judge in Kansas City in 2009 (and no relation to Devin O'Malley), is concerned about how that will play out. Back when he started, there were about 180,000 pending cases nationwide. "So it's triple the number of cases pending, which already was staggering," he says. "It's just a straight line up." Before, O'Malley says, if an undocumented immigrant had been living in the country for 30 years "minding his own business and never been in trouble," that case "would have been moved to the back of the drawer." "You just said we're going to go after the criminals and crooks, you haven't hurt anybody. ... And that's not happening now." O'Malley says <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the Constitution doesn’t specifically address immigration issues, but it does hold out certain promises and protections.</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>“<span class='card-underline'>And that includes always, of course, due process,” he says. “Which means simply the right to know what you’ve been charged with and the right to come in and defend yourself." As the pressure ramps up to move cases more quickly through the pipeline, the question is whether it’s possible to ensure those promises are kept.</span></p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Trump wants to end due process for undocumented immigrants, would allow ICE to deport any/all they suspect</div><div class='cite'> Katie Rogers and Sheryl Gay Stolberg June 24, 2018 New York Times, “Trump Calls for Depriving Immigrants Who Illegally Cross Border of Due Process Rights” https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/24/us/politics/trump-immigration-judges-due-process.html Katie Rogers is a White House correspondent for The New York Times.

Mr. Trump signed an executive order to end the separations last week, but the sudden shifts have led to confusion along the border about how children and parents will be reunited and to turmoil in Congress as the House prepares to vote on a sweeping immigration bill this week. Still, the president, who has always dug his heels in when criticized, has not backed back down from his hard-line talk, even amid a national outcry over a detainment policy that has resulted in the separation of more than 2,300 children from their families. <span class='card-underline'>He has instead gone on the offensive, complaining to aides about why he could not just create an overarching executive order to solve the problem</span>, according to two people familiar with the deliberations. Aides have had to explain to the president why a comprehensive immigration overhaul is beyond the reach of his executive powers. <span class='card-underline'>And privately, the president has groused that he should not have signed the order undoing separations</span>. “<span class='card-underline'>Our system is a mockery to good immigration policy and Law and Order,” Mr. Trump tweeted</span> Sunday, adding, “<span class='card-underline'>Our Immigration policy, laughed at all over the world, is very unfair to all of those people who have gone through the system legally and are waiting on line for years! Immigration must be based on merit</span>.” But <span class='card-underline'>Mr. Trump’s call to ignore due process faced both constitutional questions and dissension from Republicans in Congress, some of whom have insisted that the number of judges be increased so migrant families can have their cases heard more quickly. Federal immigration courts faced a backlog of more than 700,000 cases in May, and cases can take months or years to be heard. </span>Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, has proposed doubling the number of judges to roughly 750, while Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin and chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” that he believes an additional 225 judges are needed. He noted that only 74 of the current immigration judges are serving at the border. “We need to increase that,” Mr. Johnson said. “The Trump administration is going to try and come up with another 15,000 beds for family units. But none of this is easy.” The House bill up for a vote this week would beef up border security and provide a path to citizenship for the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers, while also effectively codifying Mr. Trump’s executive order by allowing migrant families to be detained together indefinitely. Many on Capitol Hill believe legislation is necessary to deal with the order, since it allows indefinite detentions<span class='card-underline'>. Under a 1997 consent decree known as the Flores settlement, migrant children can be detained for no more than 20 days, leaving the order’s status in court in doubt. </span>But the president’s conflicting statements are complicating legislative efforts, said Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona. “It makes it very difficult,” Mr. Flake said on ABC’s “This Week,” continuing, “It’s difficult in any event, right, in an election year where the president has decided to have this at the forefront of the Republican election strategy to paint the Democrats as soft on immigration.” He added: “<span class='card-underline'>I don’t know how in the world we’re going to fix this in the short term, given the Flores decision and given the lack of infrastructure, judges to process these claims. It’s really a big mess</span>.” Mr. Trump’s tweets on Sunday threw new legal questions into the puzzle. Laurence H. Tribe, a constitutional law professor at Harvard, said in an email that the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that “the due process requirements of the Fifth and 14th Amendments apply to all persons, including those in the U.S. unlawfully.” “<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Trump is making the tyrannical claim that he has the right to serve as prosecutor, judge and jury with respect to all those who enter our country</span></span>,” Mr. Tribe said. “<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>That is a breathtaking assertion of unbounded power — </span></span><span class='card-underline'>power without any plausible limit.”</span><span class='card-underline'> </span>The Fifth Amendment mandates the due process of law, and the 14th Amendment, in part, expanded due process rights for immigrants, with case law asserting those rights dating back to 1886. But Justice Department lawyers under both Democratic and Republican administrations have argued that noncitizens apprehended at the border lack due process protections, said Adam Cox, a law professor at New York University, and the Supreme Court has never clearly resolved the dispute. <span class='card-underline'>Since Mr. Trump was elected, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>his administration has been working to expand the terms of a 1996 statute that allows immigration officials to quickly deport undocumented immigrants</span></span><span class='card-underline'> as well as those whose papers are believed to be fraudulent</span>. The Trump administration has the ability to expand the statute to encompass the entire country and apply it to any noncitizen who has not been in the country for more than two years, Mr. Cox said. “<span class='card-underline'>One of the things that is being considered is an expanded expedited removal to the full statutory limi</span>t,” he said, adding that “<span class='card-underline'>it is already true that a lot of people show up at the border get removed with no access to immigration courts or the judicial process.” </span>Mr. Cox said <span class='card-underline'>the president could be reacting to seeing a high number of people held in detention centers claiming they face harm back home</span>. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether the president knew the legal ins and outs of his demand. “Many members of the administration seem to think that the high rate necessarily means a lot of fraud,” Mr. Cox said of asylum claims, “so what they could like to do is remove that process.” Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has made illegal immigration a focus of his career, has moved to back up the president’s words with action in recent months. In April, <span class='card-underline'>Mr. Sessions announced a “zero tolerance” immigration policy, which set off the mass separation of families</span> that the president sought to end with his executive order last week. <span class='card-underline'>Criminal prosecutions for illegally crossing the southwestern border jumped to 8,298 in April, the month Mr. Sessions announced the zero-tolerance policy, an increase of 30 percent from March, according to data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a research institute at Syracuse University</span>. Last week, the Defense Department lent 21 lawyers to the Justice Department to focus on prosecuting a backlog in border crossing cases. And on Sunday, the defense secretary, Jim Mattis, said the Pentagon was looking at using two bases to hold an unknown number of migrants, though he would not comment on their location or whether they would house children. Omar Jadwat, director of the Immigrants’ Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union, called the president’s demand to dispense with due process illegal. “Any official who has sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution and laws should disavow it unequivocally,” he said. <span class='card-underline'>M</span><span class='card-underline'>r. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Trump’s call to end due process is not a total surprise — he has alluded to taking similar measures for weeks.</span></span> While in Las Vegas on Saturday, <span class='card-underline'>Mr. Trump told supporters that he thought the immigration system needed fewer judges. Mr. Trump also suggested last week that he opposed adding judges because many of them could be corrupt.</span> <span class='card-underline'>He has long been a critic of immigration judges, saying they were not effective in stopping the flow of people coming into the country, sometimes using incorrect numbers to make his point. </span>“<span class='card-underline'>We have thousands of judges. Do you think other countries have judges?” Mr. Trump said during a round-table discussion in May. “We give them, like, trials. That’s the good news. The bad news is, they never show up for the trial. O.K.?” There are actually fewer than 400 judges dedicated to such work</span>, according to the website PolitiFact. <span class='card-underline'>Mr. Trump also tweeted on Friday that Republicans should “stop wasting their time” on the broad House immigration bill,</span> but Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said on “Fox News Sunday” that he had spoken to the White House, which had assured him that Mr. Trump was “still 100 percent behind us.” Mr. Trump’s careening from one extreme to another has been a staple of his campaign and presidency, allowing people to hear what they want in what he says — and leaving his White House to sort through a messy pile of conflicting directives and Congress to grasp for clues about which bills he might support. The prospects for the House bill are iffy at best; some conservatives are balking at the citizenship provisions, which critics regard as “amnesty.” If it fails, Mr. McCaul said the House may be forced to consider a narrower measure — a so-called skinny bill — that would address only the issues surrounding detention of migrant families. “I think we at a minimum have to deal with the family separation,” Mr. McCaul said. “I’m a father of five. I think this is inhumane and I think the pictures that we have seen — that’s not the face of America.”</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Poor health and medical practices in detention centers jeopardize the lives of detainees</div><div class='cite'>PAUL MOSES 06.08.18 The Daily Beast, “The Worst Place Ever’ Is ICE’s Etowah County Detention Center in Alabama” https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-worst-place-ever-is-ices-etowah-county-detention-center-in-alabama Paul Moses is a former City Hall bureau chief and city editor at Newsday’s New York City edition and the author, most recently, of An Unlikely Union: The Love-Hate Story of New York’s Irish and Italians (NYU Press, 2015). He is a retired professor of journalism at Brooklyn College/CUNY. (JM)</div><div class='card-body'><p><span class='card-underline'>Damian Reynolds says he saw what the staff at the Etowah County Detention Center had missed—that his fellow prisoner and Jamaican immigrant Miguel Williamson could die in his cell if he didn’t get immediate medical attention. </span>Williamson was a healthy 45-year-old man when he and Reynolds, held by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) pending deportation, arrived at the county-run Alabama jail after a snow-delayed, double-shackled trip from Massachusetts on Jan. 26, 2014. Reynolds said that months later, he brought food to the listless Williamson, propped him up so he could walk to the shower, contacted his ICE deportation officer, made entreaties to sheriff’s deputies and submitted written requests for medical care in his behalf. “IT’S THREE DAYS SINCE I HAVE ASK TO SEE THE DOCTOR,” Reynolds wrote on a request form sent in Williamson’s name on May 21, 2014. “. . . AND I’M PEEING BLOOD. CAN YOU PLEASE HELP ME.” The in-house medical staff eventually gave Williamson a strong antibiotic, but six days later it rejected his complaint that he “is unable to walk and feels funny all over” as “subjective,” according to medical records. Reynolds says a correction officer put it to him another way: “Medical is saying that, he’s—you know, he’s faking it. There ain’t nothing wrong with him.” “That place in Alabama, oh my God. That’s the worst place, that’s the worst place ever.” Reynolds reached out to a captain in the sheriff’s office for help—“I had to literally beg,” he says—and Williamson was held overnight in the jail’s clinic, then sent to a hospital in the morning for “general weakness.” Doctors there found that his urinary tract infection had spread throughout his body: It very nearly killed him. Within the hour he arrived in the emergency room, he suffered a heart attack due to septic shock, according to medical records. “Locked down my kidneys. It locked down my heart, and then it locked down my brain,” Williamson said in a recent telephone interview from Jamaica, where he was deported the week before Christmas last year. <span class='card-underline'>He continues to suffer the medical consequences of his time at Etowah, but without the access to health care he’d have in the United States. </span>“That place in Alabama, oh my God. That’s the worst place, that’s the worst place ever,” he said. ‘Not a Bed and Breakfast’ He’s not the only one saying that. <span class='card-underline'>Advocates for immigrants have launched a campaign called Shut Down Etowah, calling for the federal government to end a contract begun some two decades ago. Significantly, a high-level Department of Homeland Security office—created by Congress to ensure that the agency upholds the public’s civil liberties—also urged ICE leaders to stop using the Etowah jail because of a long pattern of uncorrected civil rights violations. </span>Located in Gadsden in northeastern Alabama, next to the courthouse where Judge Roy Moore began his judicial career by posting the Ten Commandments in his courtroom, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the Etowah County facility is emblematic of much of what’s wrong with the world’s largest immigration detention system</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>. The detainees are isolated from their families and from legal help, 500 miles from the immigration court. They’re held, longer than almost anywhere else in the system, in the wrong kind of facility</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. Like other jails, Etowah is meant for short-timers who are either awaiting trial or serving minor sentences, and not for civil detention—which is supposed to be non-punitive. So there is no outdoor recreation space. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Nor is there space for visitors to meet detainees</span></span><span class='card-underline'>; that’s done through video from an adjacent building. And pay for a sheriff’s detention deputy is $11.99 an hour, leading to turnover and an inexperienced staff. </span>Now, the Trump administration is poised to ease the 18-year-old standards that county jails like Etowah must agree to maintain—rules that experts say are already weak and outdated. Meanwhile, a federal advisory council led by former FBI Director William Webster has urged ICE to do the opposite: Stop holding detainees in county jails for anything more than 72 hours. “IT’S THREE DAYS SINCE I HAVE ASK TO SEE THE DOCTOR… AND I’M PEEING BLOOD. CAN YOU PLEASE HELP ME.” “I think the Etowah facility should be closed,” Megan H. Mack, who headed Homeland Security’s Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties in the last two years of the Obama administration, told The Daily Beast. “It is not appropriate for housing immigration detainees and may be not for regular inmates either. The facility is inadequate.” A report released in June 2016 disclosed that that <span class='card-underline'>the civil rights office of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which includes ICE, had called on the agency to stop holding detainees at Etowah. The office emphasized the gravity of the situation by issuing what it called its first “super-recommendation memorandum.” </span>Mack had sent a May 28, 2015, memo to ICE leadership criticizing the agency for failing to respond to the changes her DHS office called for after on-site inspections of Etowah in 2006, 2008, and 2012. In the three years since the last inspection, her office said, 50 new complaints were under investigation. “We therefore conclude that serious problems persist,” the memo said. Given the findings of previous investigations, which were conducted by experts of national standing, the civil rights office concluded it “has strong reason to believe that many of these complaints identify real and continuing problems at the facility.” (DHS released a highly redacted version of the memo to the Adelante Alabama Worker Center and other non-profit organizations that filed suit for it under the Freedom of Information Act. The suit is continuing at U.S. District Court in Manhattan.) <span class='card-underline'>Among these complaints were charges that spoiled food was served, and multiple reports of ICE officers roughing up handcuffed detainees to put their fingerprint on travel documents. </span>Bryan Cox, a spokesman for ICE, said the agency “is aware of that report” and that other “inspections have consistently found the Etowah County Detention Center to operate in compliance with ICE’s rigorous national detention standards.” Even so, the most recent publicly available ICE Office of Detention Oversight compliance report for Etowah, based on a December 2016 inspection, found that the jail met only six of 15 standards surveyed, with deficiencies in food service and telephone access, which was overpriced. The 2016 report listed more more than twice as many deficiencies as the office’s previous report on Etowah, three years earlier. In recent months, the jail’s notoriety grew following disclosures that Etowah County Sheriff Todd Entrekin pocketed jail funding thanks to an Alabama law that allows sheriffs to keep surplus funds for food—money left over from serving meals that detainees say are so skimpy that they’re often hungry. Entrekin said that outside agencies frequently inspect his jail. “We have passed those inspections with flying colors each and every time,” he claimed in a March 23 news conference. Entrekin and his spokesperson have not returned numerous messages and calls seeking comment for this article. At the news conference, Entrekin insisted the food he serves is nutritious and healthy. The sheriff released his tax returns and answered reporters’ questions about his finances to demonstrate his contention that it was legal for him to take $750,000 over three years in “surplus” food money paid by the state and federal governments. “This is not a bed and breakfast,” he said, scoffing at detainees who said they were revolted by the food. Entrekin’s protestations did not impress Etowah County voters, who ousted him by a 2-to-1 margin in a June 5 Republican primary. The winner, Rainbow City Police Chief Jonothon Horton, pledged that he would not take any of the jail money for himself. ICE, however, has not taken a public stand on Entrekin’s use of the jail funds and did not respond to a request for comment . ‘A Step Backwards’ <span class='card-underline'>Even setting aside the Etowah County jail’s checkered history, experts say it would still be a poor choice for jailing immigrants long-term. </span>Kevin Landy, a former ICE assistant director who headed the agency’s Office of Detention Policy and Planning, said county jails like Etowah are intended for short-term detention of people awaiting trial or serving misdemeanor sentences, not for years of incarceration. “My opinion is the agency’s use of Etowah as a long-term detention facility is inappropriate,” he said. “<span class='card-underline'>Due to its remote location and the conditions at the facility, that jail should at most be used for the short-term detention of individuals apprehended nearby and awaiting transfer to a more suitable facility.</span> That policy would result in a substantially reduced population at Etowah.” While ICE’s use of privately run facilities has drawn much criticism, its deals with county jails have received less attention. But, as an internal advisory council warned DHS in a December 2016 report, <span class='card-underline'>many experts and government officials believe that “county jails are, in general, the most problematic facilities for immigration detention.”</span> The Homeland Security Advisory Council, headed by Webster, recommended that ICE “use county jails only for short-term detention (less than 72 hours) before transfer to larger and higher-quality dedicated facilities”—that is, facilities used only to detain immigrants. “It won’t be an improvement overall if we phase out private facilities and it results in a greater use of county detention facilities,” said council member David Martin, former deputy general counsel to the Department of Homeland Security and professor emeritus of law at the University of Virginia. But, he added, “<span class='card-underline'>this administration, that’s not a priority for them. They’re looking to expand the use of detention and make more detention facilities available.” </span>A spokeswoman for ICE, Danielle Bennett, said it would be “operationally infeasible” for ICE to limit detention in county jails to no more than 72 hours. In fact, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>ICE is planning to make it easier for county-run facilities like Etowah to comply with federal standards for holding detainees long-term.</span></span></p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Plan: The USFG should remove immigration courts from under the DOJ and place them in their own system in addition to hiring more judges

Rather than working to solve the problems, the Trump administration has exacerbated them<span class='card-underline'>. According</span><span class='card-underline'> to the</span><span class='card-underline'> Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse</span><span class='card-underline'> (</span><span class='card-underline'>TRAC</span><span class='card-underline'>), </span><span class='card-underline'>there were nearly 600,000 immigration cases pending at the end of last May</span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> While the case backlog used to be “manageable”—staying under 200,000—it crossed that threshold during President Obama’s first term and has risen quickly since. <span class='card-underline'>By expanding enforcement priorities without a corresponding expansion of court personnel, President Trump’s policies are making that backlog worse</span>. As a result, immigration-related arrests have skyrocketed, increasing by 38 percent this year, but adjudication rates have remained the same. The overflowing dockets of immigration judges have led to nightmarish scheduling delays. Currently, <span class='card-underline'>according to TRAC, the average wait time for a Master Calendar hearing</span><span class='card-underline'>—a preliminary hearing meant to provide a chance to plead and schedule an actual merits hearing—</span><span class='card-underline'>is nine months. After that, many wait upwards of 670 days to have their case heard</span><span class='card-underline'>. </span><span class='card-underline'>Some wait</span><span class='card-underline'> four to </span><span class='card-underline'>five years</span><span class='card-underline'>. The huge backlog of cases is harming immigrants who are stuck in limbo as they wait to learn their fate. It can ruin their chances of receiving pro bono representation, which is usually necessary to win a case</span>. Worse still, asylum seekers have seen their backlog more than quadruple in the last five years. In the years they wait for a decision on their case, witnesses disappear and evidence becomes outdated, drastically reducing their chance of making a successful claim. Meanwhile, family members may be stuck in their dangerous home countries, waiting for the asylum case to be resolved to escape. Additionally, the existing backlog poses a potential threat to our public safety and national security, while also creating negative economic effects. The delays allow immigrants picked up for criminal convictions or charges to roam free in the United States for years afterward without much in the way of supervision. Further, while these individuals wait for their hearings, they often can’t work and have to rely on benefits—especially true for asylees<span class='card-underline'>. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>It is therefore in our interest to reduce the delays and get these cases through quickly</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>. </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>While the number of cases has increased, the main cause of the backlog is the failure to hire enough immigration judges to deal with the influx</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>.</span></span><span class='card-underline'> There are currently </span><span class='card-underline'>only</span><span class='card-underline'> 58 immigration courts throughout the country, situated in 27 states, Guam, and Puerto Rico</span><span class='card-underline'>. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>There are just 300 sitting immigration judges, 39 percent of whom are currently </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>eligible</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> to retire</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. </span><span class='card-underline'>Attorney General Sessions </span><span class='card-underline'>has plans</span><span class='card-underline'> to hire 50 new judges this year, and 75 next year, </span><span class='card-underline'>in order to deal with the caseload</span><span class='card-underline'>. However, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>this modest increase in judges will not</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>be enough to</span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>cover the new influx of cases, much less </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>tackle</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> the existing backlog</span></span>. According to a report by Human Rights First, the system needs over 500 judges completing at least 500 cases each year until 2023 in order to end the backlog. Since it currently takes close to two years to hire an immigration judge, it is unlikely that this backlog will be dealt with anytime soon. <span class='card-underline'>Solutions There are a few things the</span><span class='card-underline'> Trump </span><span class='card-underline'>administration could do to reduce the backlog</span><span class='card-underline'> and improve the immigration court system. First, </span><span class='card-underline'>the administration should focus its resources on increasing the number of immigration judges. This would not only reduce the backlog, but also help alleviate the pressure on the existing judges, and allow them to focus more on individual cases rather than speeding through them</span><span class='card-underline'>. </span>Second, the administration should ensure that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)<span class='card-underline'> is prioritizing criminals and dangerous undocumented immigrants rather than targeting all undocumented individuals. By focusing enforcement resources on removing only those who commit crimes and pose a real danger to society, the administration would not only further its goal of making our country safer, it would also reduce the backlog. Third, as the American Bar Association and the President of the National Association of Immigration Judges, the Hon. Dana Leigh Marks, </span><span class='card-underline'>suggested</span><span class='card-underline'>, it could be beneficial if Congress were to remove the immigration court system from under the Department of Justice and allow it to be its own system, like the current system of bankruptcy court</span><span class='card-underline'>s. This idea was </span><span class='card-underline'>first introduced</span><span class='card-underline'> in 1981 by the Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy. </span><span class='card-underline'>The new system would still handle immigration issues, but the judges would have more control over the system and their own dockets. It would also allow for the creation of both a trial and appellate division to better resolve any errors made during cases, as well as provide national, binding caselaw. Additionally, separating them from the Department of Justice would reduce much of the politicization entrenched within the system</span><span class='card-underline'>. Many of President Trump’s current immigration policies serve only to further strain an already overburdened system</span>. By increasing the number of immigration judges and enforcing removal priorities, the backlog could be alleviated, hundreds of thousands of immigrants could be saved from years of waiting, and we could get dangerous criminals off of the streets. The administration should craft its policies to solve the real problems at hand rather than making them worse </p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>The DOJ pressures immigration courts to align with Trump’s political views in addition to increasing the court backlog through bad policy.

Several organizations, including the American Bar Association and the American Immigration Lawyers Association, recommended that <span class='card-underline'>Congress make the immigration courts independent courts under Article I of the Constitution.</span> Congress should do so without delay, especially in light of the attorney general’s May 17 decision in Matter of Castro-Tum eliminating administrative closure. People on both sides of the political divide agree that the immigration courts are overburdened. The approximately 350 immigration judges who work in about 60 courts around the country are currently tasked with reviewing close to 700,000 cases. The Trump administration has made several, mostly misguided, attempts to fix this backlog. However, as Former Chairman of the BIA Paul Schmidt stated recently <span class='card-highlight'>‘‘</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Nobody… can fix this system while it remains under the control of DOJ</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>.’</span></span><span class='card-underline'>’ Because the immigration courts, along with the Board of Immigration Appeals, are currently part of the Department of Justice, the attorney general, and others in the executive, not least of all the president, are in charge of agency regulations, case procedures, the hiring and firing of judges, and decision-making.</span> In recent months the administration has made unprecedented attacks on the judicial independence of immigration judges, including policy changes that are in direct contradiction to the recommendations of an April 2017 Booz Allen Hamilton report commissioned by the Department of Justice<span class='card-underline'>. On March 30 </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the administration instituted a </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>case completion quota of 700</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> a year</span></span><span class='card-underline'> for a “satisfactory” performance rating</span>. This amounts to each Immigration Judge needing to complete on average three cases every working <span class='card-underline'>day. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>For judges who have dockets with a high number of asylum cases,</span></span><span class='card-underline'> for example, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>this arbitrary requirement will push them to expedite cases in ways that are extremely dangerous to due process</span></span>. As the president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, Judge Tabaddor, testified at the congressional hearing, there has been ‘‘no quota ever, in any court; somehow implicit in [designating a quota] is that judges are not doing enough… [However, w]e should focus on [is] how we can support our judges.’’ Over the last six years I have directly or indirectly litigated over a hundred asylum cases, and in 95 percent of the cases the hearing takes about 3.5 hours, or the equivalent of one working morning or afternoon. This does not include the time a judge needs in camera to review the hundreds of pages of evidence in the record. In reality, a judge who completes one asylum case a day, and not three, is already extremely efficient. The real problem is not with how hard-working the immigration judges are. As I explained in a 2016 article, part of <span class='card-underline'>the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>problem lies with understaffing</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. Instead of hiring a reasonable number of judges and law clerks, and otherwise investing in supporting the work of our Immigration Judges, the Administration is </span><span class='card-underline'>eliminating administrative closure</span><span class='card-underline'> and </span><span class='card-underline'>calling for administratively closed cases to be put back on the docket</span>, <span class='card-underline'>actions that only serve to raise the number of pending cases.</span> If, for example, the Department of Justice puts all the administratively closed cases back on the docket, it would increase the court backlog to over 1,000,000. These are cases of crime victims and DACA recipients and others where an immigration judge has already determined that it would not be a good use of judicial resources, or in the public interest, to litigate, usually because the person is eligible for some non-judicial form of immigration relief and has a case pending with USCIS. Re-calendaring these cases would not only unnecessarily increase the work of taxpayer-funded DHS Trial Attorneys but it would add more pressure to the already overworked immigration judges. The attorney general has also stepped into managing the immigration courts by restricting the use of continuances, which in the fast-paced detention context where my organization works are often necessary in order to have time to obtain crucial pieces of evidence and otherwise prepare for trial. While the attorney general is the boss and is responsible for the judges’ performance, he should have a little more faith in the good judgement of his immigration judges, who, unlike the attorney general, are looking at the situation-specific issues in the individual case before them. While the helpfulness of the attorney general’s methods for carrying out his job are questionable at best, <span class='card-underline'>the underlying problem remains that, regardless of our political opinion on the administration’s policies, those policies are affecting the judicial independence of our immigration courts and putting due process in jeopardy</span>. What the attorney general says matters to the immigration judges working under him. In one recent case, the immigration judge cited him as saying there is a lot of fraud in the asylum process as evidence that the asylum seeker was lying. Not only was the attorney general’s statement not based on facts — at least not on facts made publicly available, or that anyone even claimed exist, and which statement runs in stark contrast to my six years of on-the-ground experience — but that statement had nothing to do with the truthfulness of the individual asylum seeker present before the court. Additionally, as stated by the former president of the National Association of Immigration Judges Dana Marks<span class='card-underline'>, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>there is a ‘‘</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>conflict of interest between the judicial and prosecutorial functions</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> [</span></span><span class='card-underline'>of the Department of Justice that] </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>creates a significant</span></span><span class='card-underline'> (and perhaps even fatal) </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>flaw to the immigration court structure</span></span>.’’ <span class='card-underline'>It appears that the administration is looking for specific outcomes in cases with little regard to the merits of the claim. The attorney general has </span><span class='card-underline'>certified an unprecedented number cases to himself for review</span><span class='card-underline'> with the idea that he might change the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals</span>. This extraordinary power of one political-appointee to overturn the decision of trained immigration judges is fundamentally at odds with judicial independence. <span class='card-underline'>Unfortunately, it appears that not only the review and firing of judges has become political, but their hiring too. Information has surfaced that the </span><span class='card-underline'>Department of Justice is asking candidates questions about their political party affiliation</span><span class='card-underline'>, their position on same-sex relationships, and their opinion on abortion; preparing internal memos on those whose immigration views that do not align with the administration’s policies; slowing down review of applications where there are ideological differences; and withdrawing employment offers or delaying start dates by up to a one and a half years</span>.<span class='card-underline'> Making judicial decisions subject to the political whims of the times, and not dependent on the accurate execution of the law, is a serious risk to the checks-and-balances system underlying our democracy. The need for independent immigration courts has never been clearer.</span></p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Recent polls suggest broad bipartisan support for asylum reform.</div><div class='cite'> Eleanor Acer March 27, 2015 Human Rights First, “Americans Overwhelmingly Support Asylum Reform to Protect Refugees” https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/blog/poll-americans-overwhelmingly-support-asylum-reform-protect-refugees As the director of Human Rights First’s Refugee Protection program, Eleanor Acer oversees Human Rights First’s research and advocacy on issues relating to refugee protection, asylum, and migrants’ rights.

For example, 78 percent of those who responded in targeted districts agree that Congress should increase the number of immigration judges who serve on immigration courts to help ensure fair and timely hearings for those who are fleeing persecution.

He is a partner at Dzubow & Pilcher, PLLC. (JM)</div><div class='card-body'><p>The Republican Party Platform is finally here (yippee!). While the document does not bind either the party or its candidate, it does tell us something about Republican thinking on a wide variety of topics. Two paragraphs in the 54-page Platform cover asylum and refugee issues, and I want to discuss those here. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The RNC Platform would block “the gays” from receiving asylum in the U.</span></span><span class='card-underline'>S. It would also make it easier for them to get asylum FROM the U.S. </span>Interestingly, the Platform itself does not call for a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” However, <span class='card-underline'>it does view asylum through the prism of national security, and it does place extra scrutiny on people coming from “regions associated with Islamic terrorism.”</span> The first paragraph of interest (found on page 26 of the Platform) reconfirms America’s commitment to assisting refugees, but with a few caveats– From its beginning, our country has been a haven of refuge and asylum. That should continue — but with major changes. <span class='card-underline'>Asylum should be limited to cases of political, ethnic or religious persecution</span>. As the Director of the FBI has noted, it is not possible to vet fully all potential refugees. <span class='card-underline'>To ensure our national security, refugees who cannot be carefully vetted cannot be admitted to the country, especially those whose homelands have been the breeding grounds for terrorism</span>. I take issue with a few points here. First, the Platform seeks to limit asylum to people who face “political, ethnic or religious persecution.” Under our current law, a person can qualify for asylum if she fears persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or particular social group. Presumably, “ethnic” persecution in the Platform refers to persecution on account of race or nationality under existing law, which means that four of the five protected categories are covered in the RNC document. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Conspicuously absent from the Platform’s language, however, is protection for people who are members of a “particular social group.”</span></span> This omission is significant for a few reasons. First, it <span class='card-underline'>contravenes our treaty obligations (we are signatories to the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, which covers all five protected categories). If we seek to modify our obligations under the treaty, other countries may follow suit. This would have an unfortunate ripple effect on refugee protection throughout the world. It would also downgrade our leadership role with regards to refugee resettlement, and may signal a withdrawal of our leadership in world affairs more generally.</span> Second, <span class='card-underline'>the change would mean that we no longer offer refuge to many people who we now protect. Those who fear persecution on account of sexual orientation, female genital mutilation, and domestic violence are some prime examples of people we protect because they are members of a particular social group</span> (“PSG”). Indeed, those refugees most affected by this change would be women and sexual minorities. I suppose this is consistent with the rest of the RNC Platform, which–to say the least–is not all that friendly towards women or LGBT individuals. Third, eliminating PSG as a protected category would effectively end any possibility for relief for the unaccompanied minors who have been arriving at our Southern border in large numbers since about 2012. Most of these young people are fleeing violence in Central America. They already have a difficult time obtaining protection in the U.S., but if the PSG category were eliminated, the likelihood that any of them could obtain asylum would become virtually nil. The second paragraph in the RNC Platform related to refugees appears on page 42 of the document– [We] cannot ignore the reality that border security is a national security issue, and that our nation’s immigration and refugee policies are placing Americans at risk. <span class='card-underline'>To keep our people safe, we must secure our borders, enforce our immigration laws, and properly screen refugees and other immigrants entering from any country. In particular we must apply special scrutiny to those foreign nationals seeking to enter the United States from terror-sponsoring countries or from regions associated with Islamic terrorism</span>. This was done successfully after September 11, 2001, under the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System, which should be renewed now. I take issue with a number of points in this paragraph, but here I will discuss only those related to refugees. First, the paragraph echos Donald Trump, who has claimed that we don’t know where these refugees come from, or who they are. This is utterly false. In truth, we know far more about the refugees who come here than we know about other categories of immigrants or non-immigrant visitors. Refugees are subject to intensive screenings and multiple background checks. Indeed, we probably know more about the refugees (and immigrants) entering our country than we know about our own citizens, and most studies show that such people are less likely to commit crimes than the native born. I also disagree with the Platform’s plan to re-start the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System (“NSEERS”), which was suspended in 2011. Under NSEERS, men and boys from many Arab and Muslim countries were required to specially register with the U.S. government. The confusing system led to great difficulty for many of these people (and their families), but resulted in no terrorism-related convictions. In other words, there is basically no evidence that NSEERS made us any safer, but there is plenty of evidence that it harmed innocent people who happened to be from Arab or Muslim countries. Finally, there is one point in the Platform that I agree with: We must continue to screen refugees and others who come to our country from regions that produce terrorists (and from everywhere else as well). Of course, we already do this, and I don’t think there is anyone in American who thinks we should do otherwise. The RNC’s implied accusation here is that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have been letting un-vetted refugees enter our country. That is a lie, and anyone who follows the painfully-slow process of refugee admissions knows it. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>What little the RNC has to say in its Platform is not good for refugees, and it is especially bad for refugees who happen to be women, children, LGBT individuals or Muslims.</span></span> If there is a silver lining here, I suppose it is that the Platform devotes only two paragraphs to refugee issues. These days, when it comes to Republicans and refugees, the less said, the better.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Republican base oppose immigration all legal immigration if it comes from non-white nations – plan unpopular among voter bases, sways GOP policymakers</div><div class='cite'>PETER BEINART FEB 18, 2018 The Atlantic, “It's Not Illegal Immigration That Worries Republicans Anymore” https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/02/what-the-new-gop-crack-down-on-legal-immigration-reveals/553631/ Peter Beinart is a contributing editor at The Atlantic and an associate professor of journalism and political science at the City University of New York. (JM)</div><div class='card-body'><p><span class='card-underline'>A few weeks ago, the contours of an immigration compromise looked clear: Republicans would let the “Dreamers” stay. Democrats would let Trump build his wall.</span> Both sides would swallow something their bases found distasteful in order to get the thing their bases cared about most. Since then, <span class='card-underline'>Trump has blown up the deal</span>. He announced on Wednesday that he would legalize the “Dreamers,” undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, only if Democrats funded his wall and ended the visa lottery and “chain migration.” <span class='card-underline'>He would support a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants only if Congress brought the number of legal immigrants down. </span>There’s an irony here, which was pointed out to me by CATO Institute immigration analyst David Bier. Until recently, Republican politicians drew a bright line between illegal immigration, which they claimed to hate, and legal immigration, which they claimed to love. Florida Senator Marco Rubio launched his presidential campaign at the Freedom Tower, Miami’s Ellis Island. Texas Senator Ted Cruz, who in 2013 proposed a five-fold increase in the number of H1B visas for highly skilled immigrants, declared in April 2015 that, “There is no stronger advocate for legal immigration in the U.S. Senate than I am.” Mitt Romney promised in 2007 that, “We’re going to end illegal immigration to protect legal immigration.” Trump has turned that distinction on its head. He’s willing to legalize the “Dreamers”—who came to the United States illegally—so long as the number of legal immigrants goes down. <span class='card-underline'>He has not only blurred the GOP’s long-held moral distinction between legal and illegal immigration. In some ways, he’s actually flipped it—taking a harder line on people who enter the U.S. with documentation than those who don’t. </span>What explains this<span class='card-underline'>? Trump’s great hidden advantage during the 2016 Republican presidential primary was his lack of support from the GOP political and donor class.</span> This allowed him to jettison positions—in support of free trade, in support of the Iraq War, in support of cutting Medicare and Social Security—that enjoyed support among Republican elites but little support among Republican voters. He did the same on immigration, where <span class='card-underline'>the “legal good, illegal bad” distinction turned out to be much more popular among the party’s leaders than among its grassroots.</span> Cribbing from Ann Coulter’s book, Adios America, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Trump replaced the legal-illegal distinction with one that turned out to have more resonance on the activist right: </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The distinction between white Christian immigrants and non-white, and non-Christian ones</span></span>. The words “illegal immigration” do not appear in Trump’s presidential announcement speech. <span class='card-underline'>Instead, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Trump focused on immigrants’ country of origin</span></span>. “When Mexico sends its people,” he declared, “they’re not sending their best … They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists … It’s coming from more than Mexico. It’s coming from all over South and Latin America, and it’s coming probably—probably—from the Middle East.” Trump, who often says bluntly what other Republicans say in code, probably realized that “<span class='card-underline'>illegal immigrant” was, for many voters, already a euphemism for Latino or Mexican-immigrants.</span> In their book White Backlash, the political scientists Marisa Abrajano and Zoltan Hajnal cite a poll showing that 61 percent of Americans believe that most Latino immigrants are undocumented even though only about a quarter are<span class='card-underline'>. “When Americans talk about undocumented immigrants, Latinos or immigrants in general,” they note, “the images in their heads are likely to be the same.” What really drove Republican opinion about immigration, Trump realized</span>, was not primarily the fear that the United States was becoming a country of law-breakers. (Republicans, after all, were not outraged about the lack of prosecution of tax cheats.) It <span class='card-underline'>was the fear that the United States—which was becoming less white and had just elected a president of Kenyan descent—was becoming a third-world country. </span>When the Public Religion Research Institute and Brookings Institution asked Americans in 2016 their views of immigration from different parts of the world, it found that <span class='card-underline'>Republicans were only three points more likely than Democrats to want to reduce immigration from “predominantly Christian countries” and only seven points more likely to want to reduce immigration from Europe. By contrast, they were 33 points more likely to support reducing immigration from Mexico and Central America and 41 points more likely to support reducing immigration from “predominantly Muslim countries.” </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>What really drives Republican views about immigrants, </span></span><span class='card-underline'>in other words, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is less their legal status than </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>their nation of origin, their religion, and their race</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>.</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>Trump grasped that during the campaign, and in coalition with a bevy of current and former Southern Senators—Jeff Sessions, David Perdue and Tom Cotton—he has used it to turn the GOP into a party devoted to slashing legal immigration. On Thursday, <span class='card-underline'>when presented with a bill that traded the legalization of Dreamers for more border security but did not reduce legal immigration, only eight Republican Senators voted yes. However, 37 voted for a bill that legalized the “Dreamers,” added more border security, and substantially reduced legal immigration. </span>But there’s another reason Trump has succeeded in erasing the “legal good, illegal bad” distinction that for years governed GOP immigration debate. <span class='card-underline'>He’s made Republicans less concerned with legality in general.</span> In 2012, the GOP—which was then-outraged by executive orders that supposedly displayed President Barack Obama’s contempt for the constitutional limits of his office—titled the immigration section of its platform, “The Rule of Law: Legal Immigration.” The seven paragraph-section used variations of the word “law” 14 times. That emphasis is harder now. In his ongoing battles with the FBI, Justice Department, judiciary, and Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Trump has convinced many Republicans that the “rule of law” is often a cloak for the partisan biases of the “deep state.” As a result, Republicans are now 22 points less likely to hold a positive opinion of the FBI than they were in 2015. What really matters for many Republicans in Trump’s standoff with Mueller and the FBI is not who has the law on their side, since the bureaucracy can twist the law to its own advantage. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>What really matters is who enjoys the backing of “the people</span></span><span class='card-underline'>,”</span> the authentic America that resides outside the swamp, a construct that definitely does not include the imagined beneficiaries of “chain migration” and the “visa lottery.” In the Trump era, <span class='card-underline'>Republicans now justify their immigration views less by reference to law than by reference to tribe</span>.

(Remember the surprise expressed by many Europeans that refugees owned iPhones and were well-dressed?) The cost of plane tickets, smugglers’ fees and transportation ran into thousands of dollars per person. Families travelling together were forced to part with multiples of that sum, often selling property in Syria to pay for it all and cutting any links with the homeland.

Many countries have started developing and implementing national influenza pandemic preparedness plans. However, the level of preparedness varies among countries. Developing countries encounter unique and difficult issues and challenges in preparing for a pandemic. Deaths attributable to an influenza pandemic could be substantially higher in developing countries than in industrialized countries. Pharmaceutical interventions such as vaccines and antiviral agents are less likely to be available in developing countries. The public health and clinical infrastructure of developing countries are often inadequate to deal with a widespread health crisis such as an influenza pandemic. Such an event will inevitably have a global effect. Therefore, improving pandemic preparedness in every country, particularly developing ones, is urgently needed.Avian influenza, caused by influenza A virus (H5N1), continues to cause outbreaks among poultry and wild birds worldwide. It has spread from Asia to other regions, including Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. The number of cases of human subtype H5N1 infection also continues to rise. These historically unprecedented outbreaks have raised serious global concerns about the imminent arrival of an influenza pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) urges countries to develop and implement national pandemic preparedness plans to mitigate the health and social effects of a pandemic (1). However, the level of preparedness varies among countries. In general, developing countries have limited financial and technical resources to strengthen pandemic preparedness. They also face some unique and difficult issues, which make preparing for a pandemic more challenging. These have not been addressed adequately during planning. Effective and feasible strategies are needed to mitigate the impact of the next influenza pandemic in developing countries.When an influenza pandemic emerges, all countries worldwide will inevitably be affected. However, the impact may vary both between and within countries. The estimated deaths for various countries during the Spanish flu pandemic from 1918 to 1920 shows that mortality rates in Europe and North America were significantly lower than those in Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America (2,3). <span class='card-underline'>A recent study that estimated the global impact of </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the Spanish flu</span></span><span class='card-underline'> pandemic indicated that a considerable difference in mortality rates was observed between high- and low-income countries (</span><span class='card-underline'>4</span><span class='card-underline'>). Why </span><span class='card-underline'>the pandemic</span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>caused such high mortality rates</span></span><span class='card-underline'> in developing countries is not entirely clear. Several </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>factors</span></span><span class='card-underline'> may have been involved, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>includ</span></span><span class='card-underline'>ing </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>lack of access to adequate medical care, weak public health infrastructures</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, social factors such as housing conditions and population density, and host factors such as nutritional status and co-existing medical conditions. Another potential factor likely to influence mortality in a future pandemic is the high HIV/AIDS prevalence in some developing countries. Excess deaths attributed to pneumonia or influenza are significantly higher</span> in HIV-positive persons during influenza seasons (5). HIV co-infection with a pandemic virus can be associated with more severe infections, which may further raise death rates in countries with high HIV/AIDS prevalence.For these reasons, deaths associated with a future pandemic may be greater in developing countries than in industrialized countries. One study concluded that 96% of the estimated 62 million deaths in a future pandemic would occur in developing countries (4). The impact of such high mortality rates obviously needs to be taken into account when creating pandemic preparedness plans for developing countries. However, no appropriate model that can estimate the impact of an influenza pandemic in developing countries exists. Models are based on data from industrialized countries (6), which may underestimate the actual impact of a pandemic in developing countries.Several possible interventions can be implemented to control or mitigate the effects of an influenza pandemic, which include pharmaceutical interventions such as vaccines and antiviral agents, and nonpharmaceutical interventions such as quarantine, isolation, social distancing, and personal hygiene (7). Pharmaceutical interventions are needed for mitigating the impact of an influenza pandemic (8). Vaccines for subtype H5N1 viruses are currently being developed, and clinical trials are under way (9,10). However, worldwide vaccine production capacity is limited and is primarily in industrialized countries, where most seasonal influenza vaccine is produced (11). A recent WHO report estimated that the worldwide vaccine production capacity for current influenza vaccines is 350 million doses per year (12). That level of production is clearly insufficient to supply vaccines to all countries. Only a limited number of vaccine doses would be available, particularly in the early stages of the pandemic, and most of them would likely be supplied to industrialized countries. Many countries, especially developing countries, will be forced to confront the next pandemic with few or no available vaccines.Antiviral agents are also considered effective for an influenza pandemic. They are particularly useful in the early stages of a pandemic when there is a shortage of vaccines (13). Two groups of antiviral agents for influenza are currently available, including M2 ion-channel inhibitors (amantadine and rimantadine) and neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir). Neuraminidase inhibitors are preferred because some influenza viruses show high frequencies of resistance to M2 ion-channel inhibitors (14). Stockpiling of neuraminidase inhibitors is under way in many industrialized countries as part of national influenza pandemic preparedness (15). However, the <span class='card-underline'>stockpiles of antiviral agents available in developing countries are small and limited</span>. WHO has global and regional stockpiles of antiviral agents, which are limited and are specifically used for early response and containment. The stockpile of antiviral agents is insufficient for a global pandemic.The most critical limiting factor for stockpiling of neuraminidase inhibitors in developing countries is their high cost. One treatment course of oseltamivir (i.e., 10 tablets) costs US $15, even at a discount rate (16), which is far too expensive for developing countries. Some industrialized countries have set a target to stockpile oseltamivir to treat 25% of the general population. To purchase adequate oseltamivir for 25% of the total population, only 0.11% of the total annual health expenditure is required in high-income countries. In low-income countries, however, the expense would be 12.9% of the annual expenditure (Table 1). Therefore, it is not feasible for low-income countries to allocate scarce resources to stockpile sufficient quantities of oseltamivir for an unpredictable influenza pandemic.The recent efforts to increase global availability of vaccines and antiviral agents can contribute to increasing the global availability of these pharmaceutical interventions. However, increased availability alone will not solve all the problems in many countries. Several other issues need to be addressed to implement pharmaceutical interventions. These pharmaceutical commodities, including syringes and needles for vaccines, should be delivered to healthcare facilities throughout the country. That is a difficult logistic challenge for many developing countries. Human resources are also required to implement these interventions. Yet, there are some uncertainties about the effectiveness of these pharmaceutical interventions. Even neuraminidase inhibitors may not be fully effective for a pandemic virus, whose pathogenesis in human hosts differs from that of seasonal influenza viruses. Another potential problem with the antiviral drugs is the risk that resistant strains will emerge. Vaccines may not be effective because of antigenic differences between a vaccine strain and a pandemic virus, or for other reasons. Full-scale implementation of pharmaceutical interventions that requires enormous financial and human resources may not be the best use of limited resources in developing countries. The governments, international organizations such as WHO, and donors should consider various factors when providing support for pharmaceutical interventions in developing countries. Maintaining a balance between pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical interventions is necessary to achieve the best use of limited resources. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>During an influenza pandemic, morbidity and mortality may be extremely high. Healthcare facilities would be quickly overwhelmed with increased numbers of patients</span></span>. In the United States alone, an estimated 18–42 million outpatient visits and 314,000–734,000 hospitalizations could occur (6). The surge capacity in healthcare systems will likely be insufficient to cope with this rise in patient numbers, even in industrialized countries (17,18). Healthcare resources such as the number of physicians, nurses, and available hospital beds are limited in developing countries. In some countries, resources are insufficient to cope with patients even during normal circumstances. Hospitals and clinics in developing countries will be easily overwhelmed by the increasing number of patients during an influenza pandemic.</p><p>Using the method described by Wilson et al. (19), we estimated the number of required hospital admissions for countries of varying economic status. The percentages of available hospital beds occupied by influenza patients at incidence rates of 15% and 35% were calculated by using FluSurge software, version 2.0 (20). (WHOSIS, www.who.int/whosis/en). Results are shown in Table 2. The percentage of hospital beds required for patients with pandemic influenza is much higher in low-income countries than in high-income countries. With an incidence rate of 35%, up to 79.1% of hospital beds are required for patients with pandemic influenza in low-income countries. In countries like Bangladesh and Nepal, >100% of beds would be required for patients with pandemic influenza, even at the incidence rate of 15% (data not shown). This model is based on data from the United States, and the difference in disease severity among the countries was not considered. This model may underestimate the hospital bed requirements in developing countries, where a pandemic virus may cause more severe infections. Some hospitalized patients will require mechanical ventilation (17), but few mechanical ventilators, if any, are available in many hospitals in developing countries.</p><p>During an influenza pandemic, additional essential medical supplies such as gloves, masks, syringes, antipyretics, and antimicrobial agents will also be required. These supplies are insufficient in healthcare facilities in developing countries, even in nonemergency situations. Lack of these supplies may hamper provision of adequate medical care for patients with pandemic influenza. Basic personal protective equipment such as disposable gloves and surgical masks are needed for protecting healthcare workers. Antimicrobial agents are expected to be effective for secondary bacterial pneumonia, which can be a major cause of death for patients with pandemic influenza (21). Therefore, proper treatment with antimicrobial agents can be crucial for preventing deaths. However, in some developing countries, sufficient stocks of essential drugs, including antimicrobial agents, are often unavailable.</p><p>In countries with limited healthcare resources, providing routine medical care for other conditions may become difficult during a pandemic. For example, the treatment for tuberculosis or the antiretroviral treatment for AIDS patients may not be provided because of disruption in healthcare systems. Maintaining other public health programs, such as vaccination, may also be difficult when most of public health resources are spent for the response to a pandemic.</p><p>To minimize the impact of an influenza pandemic, good preparedness plans need to be developed. With the increasing risk for a pandemic caused by the spread of influenza A virus (H5N1), most countries have started such planning. These national plans were recently reviewed from different perspectives (15,22–24). The level of planning in many developing countries is still inadequate to deal with such a major public health crisis. Some plans are based on the available plans of industrialized countries, or follow similar approaches to those of industrialized countries. As described above, the approaches used by industrialized countries may not be feasible or appropriate for developing countries. In addition, each country has specific issues, and therefore it should develop a plan based on its own requirements. This task can be difficult for most developing countries because they have little or no expertise with influenza and pandemic preparedness. For the few infectious disease experts working on infectious diseases in each country, numerous competing priorities exist, such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and vaccine-preventable diseases. Feasible, user-friendly tools are needed to assist these countries. WHO has developed several such tools, including a checklist for national preparedness (25). However, these tools describe the general approaches to pandemic preparedness and are not specifically designed for countries with limited resources. For developing countries more practical tools are needed, among them models to estimate the impact of a pandemic in developing countries, a list of feasible interventions to mitigate the impact of pandemic without available pharmaceutical interventions, and planning guidelines for hospitals with limited resources. <span class='card-underline'>If the next pandemic occurs in a few years, vaccines and antiviral agents, particularly neuraminidase inhibitors, may not be available as a main intervention in developing countries</span>. Availability needs to be increased to fill the gaps between developed and industrialized countries. WHO recommends an increase in worldwide vaccine production to meet the demand during a pandemic (12). Several countries have initiated projects to improve influenza vaccine production with technical and financial support from WHO and donors. However, improved vaccine production capacity is not sustainable if only used for pandemic influenza vaccines. The use of seasonal influenza vaccines would also need to increase in these countries. However, the cost of the vaccines (US $3–$7 per dose) is a barrier in increasing their use (12). There is also little available evidence on the effectiveness and cost benefits of seasonal influenza vaccines in tropical developing countries. Further efforts should be made to reduce the cost and to collect additional scientific data to increase the use of seasonal influenza vaccines.Some approaches have been proposed and tested to reduce the amount of antigens per vaccine dose for pandemic vaccine so that more vaccines, including adjuvant and whole virion vaccines, can be supplied (10). The world is expected to have an increased capacity to produce vaccines for pandemic influenza viruses by 2010 (12). In some countries, the vaccines for the subtype with a pandemic potential are being produced and stockpiled as a prepandemic vaccine, which can be a useful tool to mitigate the impact of a pandemic (26). However, both pandemic and prepandemic vaccines would not be available in developing countries unless an international mechanism exists to share such vaccines with them at a low cost.</p><p>Some actions have also been taken to reduce the cost of neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir. It is being produced in sublicensing companies in developing countries to increase its supply at a lower cost. However, oseltamivir may still not be affordable for many developing countries. In industrialized countries, M2 ion-channel inhibitors are not considered a first choice of treatment because of the high rate of resistance to these inhibitors. However, amantadine is much cheaper than neuraminidase inhibitors and is more widely available. Most subtype H5N1 isolates that belong to clade 1 are resistant to amantadine, but many clade 2 viruses are still susceptible to amantadine (27). M2 ion-channel inhibitors can be a valid option for a pandemic, especially in developing countries (28). The value of M2 ion-channel inhibitors as a treatment option for an influenza pandemic should be evaluated further. The health consequences of a pandemic, including deaths, can be substantially reduced by providing better medical care. Several issues need to be addressed to provide adequate medical care during a pandemic. First, essential medical supplies such as masks, gloves, and antimicrobial agents should be available in hospitals and clinics. The stockpiles of these basic supplies can be more cost-effective in developing countries than the stockpiles of more expensive antiviral agents. Guidelines on the types and quantity of essential items that are required in hospitals and clinics should be developed. Second, healthcare personnel should be trained for infection control measures. Even surgical masks are not commonly used in many developing countries, and hand hygiene practices are not always followed. Basic training on infection control should be provided to improve pandemic preparedness in healthcare settings. Third, healthcare and public health systems need to be maintained to minimize the impact of a pandemic. These systems should be maintained to deal not only with a pandemic but also with other health problems such as malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV.More feasible and effective strategies should be developed as soon as possible to mitigate the negative impact of an influenza pandemic in developing countries. Since the availability of pharmaceutical interventions in developing countries is less likely, nonpharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing and personal hygiene may be the only available interventions. Public health measures such as school closure and household quarantine have been evaluated by using mathematical models for their effectiveness in mitigating the impact of a pandemic (29,30) and may have potential beneficial effects. However, the models suggest that substantial benefits of these measures require implementation with antiviral prophylaxis or vaccines (29,30). The evidence for effectiveness of public health measures is limited and is based primarily on experience in industrialized countries (31,32). For example, handwashing and hand hygiene have been highly publicized as a core management strategy for avian and pandemic influenza in developing countries (33). Although handwashing is effective in reducing the incidence of common diseases such as acute respiratory infections (34), data on its effectiveness specifically for community-acquired influenza infections are limited (31). Recommendations on nonpharmaceutical interventions have been based on available evidence (35). Accumulation of further scientific evidence for these measures, which can be implemented at a low cost, is urgently required. Many health programs in developing countries depend on financial support from donors. Influenza had little donor interest before the current avian influenza outbreaks. More donor funds are available for avian and pandemic influenza. These funds are often earmarked for specific activities. However, a more general approach is required to improve pandemic preparedness in developing countries. Improving pandemic preparedness without establishing a proper national program for seasonal influenza is unrealistic. For example, increasing the availability of pandemic vaccines without increasing the use of vaccines for seasonal influenza is difficult. It is also difficult to implement infection control measures in hospitals and personal hygiene during a pandemic if they are not routinely implemented for seasonal influenza and other infections.Lack of adequate infrastructure and technical expertise is a fundamental issue for developing countries, not only for influenza pandemic preparedness but also for any other infectious disease threats. Revised International Health Regulations (2005) were adopted at the World Health Assembly in 2005, under which each country is required to have core capacities for disease surveillance and response (36). Strengthening the core capacity in each country should be an essential step to improve preparedness for any public health emergency, including an influenza pandemic. Although some actions should be taken immediately to address urgent issues regarding a pandemic threat posed by influenza A (H5N1), a long-term vision is required to establish such core capacity in every country. <span class='card-underline'>An influenza pandemic will spread to every corner of the world</span>; hence, every country must be prepared for such a global event. All human cases of infection with influenza A virus (H5N1) have so far occurred in less industrialized countries, and thus the pandemic virus is likely to emerge from these countries. Epidemiologic models have indicated the possibility of rapid containment of the virus with a pandemic potential (37,38). WHO has stockpiles of oseltamivir specifically for the early containment of a potential pandemic. However, the window of opportunity is narrow, and early containment operations should be initiated as soon as the initial sign of a potential pandemic is detected. Timely sharing of the virus strains and relevant information is essential for such containment to be successful.Sharing of the virus stains is also critical to develop pandemic vaccines. However, some countries do not share the virus strains with WHO reference laboratories. These countries argue that the virus strains from their countries would be used to develop pandemic vaccines that would only be available for rich countries (39). Developing countries have no incentives to share the virus strains if they do not benefit from the vaccines developed from these strains. The gaps in resources, including vaccine production capacity between the developing and industrialized countries, hinder the global effort to respond to a pandemic. Unequal distribution of resources, including antiviral stockpiles, could also be a major international issue when an influenza pandemic occurs. Countries with limited or no antiviral stockpiles and other resources may not be able to cope with the pandemic. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>A pandemic poses a serious threat to global health security if large gaps in capacity and available resources continue to persist</span></span>. Large numbers of people may attempt to cross international borders to obtain better medical care, including antiviral treatment, or to escape a chaotic situation. Preparing for a pandemic by simply strengthening preparedness within a single country is not possible. A pandemic is a global issue, and pandemic preparedness should be considered from a global perspective.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Doctors are leaving Syria now</div><div class='cite'>Baker 14</div><div class='card-body'><p>(Aryn Baker is reporter for Time and was correspondent for Middle East) Time “Syria’s Health Crisis Spirals as Doctors Flee” Published 2/4/14</p><p>http://time.com/3968/syrias-health-crisis-spirals-as-doctors-flee/ JP</p><p>It was the third week of an uprising in Syria that would eventually evolve into a brutal civil war and already the wounded were showing up at the hospital in the Damascus suburb where 29-year-old Ahmed was doing rotations during his medical residency. Ahmed, who asked that only one part of his name be published because he is afraid of repercussions from Syria’s security agencies, had only just started examining a young man with bruises and a deep puncture wound on his right side when two armed security officials burst into the examining room barking questions. Who was the patient, they wanted to know, and how did he get his injuries? When it emerged that the patient had been at a protest that afternoon against the government of Syrian President Bashar Assad the officials hauled the young man outside. Ahmed could do nothing. “I was so angry at myself,” he recalls, as he chain-smokes in a café in Lebanon nearly three years later. “Why didn’t I protect him? I was terrified. I was a coward.” That scene in Ahmed’s examining room would play out hundreds of more times across Syria as regime thugs hunted hospitals for wounded protestors, and then later, for rebels fighting against Assad’s government. When the rebel forces in Douma, the suburb where Ahmed’s hospital is located, grew in number and strength they then took to roaming the hospital corridors, seeking to finish off any regime supporters who had been injured in the vicious street fighting. In July 2012, the Syrian government passed an anti-terrorism law that effectively made it a crime to provide medical care to anyone suspected of supporting the rebels. Ahmed was caught between the Hippocratic oath — a doctor’s promise to treat every patient — and the growing pressure to take sides. “The regime said ‘Why are you helping the Free Army?’ and the Free Army said ‘Why are you helping the regime?’” Once a supporter of the revolution, Ahmed has come to the conclusion that neither side will be able to save Syria. So he is giving up, abandoning his “patient”— Syria— once again, he says with a wry smile. Instead, he has opted for a life in the United States; relatives already there are helping him to emigrate. “Yes, maybe I feel guilty,” he admits. “Maybe I am a coward for leaving Syria. But as a doctor it is impossible to work there. I have to live, I have to eat<span class='card-highlight'>.” </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Ahmed is one of an estimated 15,000 doctors who have fled Syria over the past three years</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, according to a </span><span class='card-underline'>report released Feb. 2 by Physicians For Human Rights</span><span class='card-underline'> [PHR], </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>representing half of the certified physicians in a country whose medical system was once the envy of the Arab world. The doctors who have fled have left behind a horrifying medical crisis.</span></span> According to the World Health Organization<span class='card-underline'>, more than half of Syrian hospitals have been destroyed or severely damaged. Syria’s largest city, Aleppo, once boasted 6,000 doctors. According to the PHR report, only 250 remained as of July 2013, serving a population of 2,500,000. In the Damascus suburbs where Ahmed worked, a pre-war population of 1,000 doctors had been cut down to 30 by December</span>, according to the PHR report. Nurses, technicians, ambulance drivers and medical support personnel have been forced to abandon their posts, the report says, unable to provide care in destroyed hospitals and clinics where supplies of life-giving medicine have run out. Even if the war were to end tomorrow, its medical legacy will last a generation. The U.N. estimates that more than half a million Syrians have suffered debilitating injuries that will require long-term care. Outbreaks of communicable disease are on the rise. Manageable chronic conditions, such as diabetes, kidney failure and heart disease, are escalating into life-threatening illnesses. When the war ends, Syria will need more physicians than ever before. Yet the likelihood of doctors returning from exile is slim. The longer the war lasts, the harder it will be for them to give up their new lives. The medical staff who have fled Ahmed’s hospital have settled in France, Germany, Dubai and Saudi Arabia. Some have lucrative contracts with local hospitals; others have set up private clinics. Many are going through the arduous process of getting recertified so they can work in the United States and Europe. “<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Most doctors will not go back after the crisis</span></span>,” says Dr. Zaher Sahloul, a Chicago-based pulmonologist and head of the Syrian American Medical Society, an organization that raises funds to provide salaries and supplies to doctors still working in Syria. “Once you set up a new practice in a safe country it is a difficult decision to go back, especially since the economic situation will be so bad.” He says that around <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>1,000 to 1,200 Syrian doctors are already in the process of resettling in the U.S since the conflict started.</span></span> Though not all will continue in the medical field, it is a significant addition to the 7,000 Syrian doctors who were already in the U.S. prior to the war’s start. “It’s a huge brain drain,” Sahloul says. “I am not sure the Syrian medical system can recover from this.” <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The shortage of doctors is taking an immense toll. Based on an assessment of mortality rates, hospital intake numbers, population and treatment rates for manageable diseases prior to the war</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, Sahloul estimates that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>some 200,000 people have died in Syria because they did not have access to routine medical care</span></span>, what he calls a “secondary death toll” that is even higher than those killed by bombs and firearms. “These are the women who died in labor because there was no one to do a C-section, or the men who have a heart attack and can’t find a physician, or have complications from diabetes. People are dying of chronic diseases that three years ago would have been completely manageable.” The PHR report has found that 70,000 cancer patients and 5,000 dialysis patients have not been able to receive treatment. Oncologist Michel Abdallah fled for Jordan last year, and is now treating refugees as an employee of an aid group. The situation in Syria, he says, “is really bad. There are situations where a dermatologist might play the role of a dentist or a surgeon. We are losing patients who could have easily survived in normal circumstances. That’s not easy to come to terms with.”As Syria suffers, the American health system may benefit. Many Syrian doctors finished their advanced studies in the U.S. and are already licensed to work there. The U.S., with its high salaries and advanced medical care, has long been a magnet for doctors around the globe. Ahmed isn’t sure yet what he will do once he arrives in the U.S. After three years of war, he says he is tired of blood. “Real estate might be nice,” he muses. Still, he is hedging his bets. Unlike many doctors who fled, Ahmed is applying for official leave from his employer, the Syrian Ministry of Health. He hasn’t told them he is leaving the country, only that he is opening a private clinic. That way, if he does come back, he won’t be penalized. Sahloul thinks it’s unlikely that someone like Ahmed will ever return. That’s why, he says, it is so important to persuade the doctors still in Syria to stay. But he admits it’s a losing battle. “Doctors there not only have to deal with patients and disease, but politics and fighting groups and security. I can see why they are fleeing, but for the sake of Syria’s future, I wish they would stay.”</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Absence of Doctors leads to Chaos – Health system in Disarray</div><div class='cite'>Phillips 16</div><div class='card-body'><p>https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/fikraforum/view/syrias-compounding-healthcare-crisis JP</p><p>(Steven Phillips MD is a research scientist) The Washington Institute “Syria’s compounding  Health Care Crisis</p><p>A country’s optimal health care infrastructure comprises state of the art facilities staffed by well-trained providers with access to authoritative and current health science information. Prior to the civil war, the Syrian Arab Republic was close to this goal; it had five functioning medical schools, a National Health and Medication Plan, and thirty-seven medical libraries. During the decades preceding the Syrian civil war, access to and delivery of healthcare and healthcare information had steadily improved. According to the World Health organization, the life expectancy of the average Syrian in 2012 was 75.7 years, a leap from an average of 56 years in 1970. Pre-conflict health indicators amassed by the Syrian International Coalition for Health in 2012 noted substantial reductions in the death rate from all causes. The civil war has reversed this trend; <span class='card-underline'>average life expectancy has fallen twenty years from the 2012 level. The United Nations now estimates that 12.2 million Syrians—including approximately six million children—require urgent humanitarian assistance</span>. Understanding the on-the-ground medical realities of the Syrian conflict, and how they differ from previous conflicts, is vital for both effective allocation of United States and international resources, and the development of medical plans for the days after the civil war.Throughout the history of modern conflicts, combatants have generally recognized medical personnel and facilities as non-combatants and spared them from attack. The Geneva Convention explicitly states that both military and civilian medical personnel exclusively assigned to medical duties must be respected and protected in all circumstances. Consequently, intentionally directing attacks against identifiable medical personnel and facilities constitutes a war crime.My personal experience in Vietnam supports the idea that the Geneva Convention Rules were, by and large, followed even in intense modern warfare scenarios. The Viet Cong and North Vietnamese regulars avoided attacking adequately identified medical facilities, probably due to United States’ military hospitals’ routine treatment for wounded enemy combatants. In 1968, while serving with the 101st Airborne, my medics and I were delivering a medical civic action program (MEDCAP) in a remote village. As dusk approached, the village chief told me a Viet Cong platoon was approaching and requested we leave immediately as the platoon did not want to harm a MEDCAP team. Though we feared an ambushed, we left the village unharmed. On another occasion my medical platoon was assigned to help re-open the civilian hospital in Hue City, which had been devastated by the TET offensive. There, we treated the general civilian population that undoubtedly included many enemies and enemy sympathizers. Our proper identification ensured that we were never harmed or even threatened during that three-month assignment.The Syrian conflict stands in sharp contrast to this model of healthcare during modern warfare. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The Syrian healthcare system, public health infrastructure, and health information resources have been devastated by the ongoing civil war, especially in rebel held areas.</span></span><span class='card-underline'> Health care personnel, health care facilities, ambulances, manufacturers and suppliers of medical equipment and pharmaceuticals, including NGOs such as Doctors Without Borders, have been purposely and aggressively targeted on multiple fronts, primarily by the Syrian governmen</span>t. The Syrian government, which controls the skies, is responsible for 88 percent of recorded hospital attacks and 97 percent of medical personnel killed, with 139 deaths directly attributed to torture or execution. Rebel forces and ISIL have also been accused of targeting the health sector. In total, there have been 233 deliberate or indiscriminate attacks on 183 medical facilities. Russia’s entrance into the air campaign has dramatically increased hospital and clinic bombings. In October 2015, the first full month of Russian involvement, twelve medical facilities were purposely targeted and bombed. Early in 2016, Russian bombs targeted three hospitals, killing many and depriving thousands of Syrians access to care. <span class='card-underline'>The effects of these bombings have cumulated into a national health crisis. According to the World Health Organization, approximately two-thirds of Syrian hospitals and clinics have been rendered useless or destroyed by the war. Remaining medical facilities are understaffed, poorly equipped, undersupplied, and overwhelmed with trauma care. Restrictions on travel and sanctions have resulted in drug, medical supplies, and equipment shortages</span>. With a shattered infrastructure, both doctors and patients have suffered tremendously. Nearly 700 healthcare workers have been killed or injured, and a full half of the country’s physicians have been forced to flee the country. More than one million Syrians have been wounded or killed, leaving hundreds of thousands with poorly managed chronic disabilities and a tragic lack of access to basic medical services. Deaths from treatable diseases and wounds have skyrocketed. Aside from combat-related challenges, treatments for chronic cardiovascular and renal diseases, cancer, diabetes, and non-urgent routine medical interventions are severely interrupted. “Elective” follow-up care for wounds, amputee prosthetics, infections, and other conditions can no longer be a priority and rarely receive attention. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The large-scale displacement of the Syrian population, unsanitary conditions, and contaminated water supply is fueling a resurgence of once-extinct communicable diseases: polio, cholera, typhoid, hepatitis, and parasitic infections</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. The mental trauma inflicted by this nearly six-year long civil war on the civilian population is incalculable.</span>The Syrian American Medical Society has been actively facilitating the rotation health care volunteers in Syria, but its doctors -- Dr. Samer Atar among them -- are chronicling the horrors of the field and the severe inadequacies of the medical situation that has led to the loss of many savable lives.Healthcare professionals are in many ways at a loss as to how the situation can be alleviated. Leonard Rubinstein, Director at the Bloomberg Center for Public Health and Human Rights at Johns Hopkins University, noted that the situation in Syria “is the worst concerted attack on healthcare in living memory… in places like Bosnia, Chechnya, Afghanistan, and the Gaza Strip, there has been nothing like what has happened in Syria.”The United States has provided more than $6.5 billion in humanitarian aid since the start of the crisis. This financial effort supports the operations of the United Nations and NGOs to provide emergency relief to Syria and its neighbors, which have been overwhelmed with the burdens of refugee assistance and have periodically closed their borders due to terrorist attacks. Closed borders prevent international medical humanitarian organizations like Doctors Without Borders from treating wounded Syrians. Though unconfirmed, it is reported that the Israeli army has set up a field hospital along the Syrian border on the Golan Heights to treat wounded Syrians.Though it is obvious that the Syrian crisis will not end soon, it is important to start thinking about the major international efforts that will be required to rebuild their public health and health care infrastructure. The Syrian medical community and supporting NGOs will have to shift from a crisis response mode to a strategic planning and recovery mode. The health sector that will be assembled to support this effort will require strong command and control to coordinate efforts, prioritize activities, and develop communication protocols that can accommodate an international task force. Critically important to this effort is the use of real time, open and free access to health information provided by the US National Library of Medicines (NLM) Disaster Information Management Research Center.Throughout the history of warfare, the medical respondents, both military and civilian, have intentionally been spared from attack. Even during the intense combat of World War I and World War II, periodic truces had been called to allow medical teams to evacuate and treat the injured; not so in Syria. The Syrian government has purposefully and intentionally targeted their own medical infrastructure, including humanitarian volunteer teams. <span class='card-underline'>This violation of the Geneva Convention has resulted in the nearly complete destruction of a preconflict, modern Syrian health care system.

Safe spaces for injured civilians to seek medical care are destroyed, and whole populations may be denied access to treatment. When these attacks are as widespread as they are in Syria, the consequences reverberate across the country and region. <span class='card-highlight'>All the doctors we interviewed who remain working in Aleppo explained that if they leave, people will die for lack of medical care</span>. <span class='card-underline'>As they risked their lives to treat civilians, including colleagues, whose bodies were shattered by barrel-bomb attacks, these physicians expressed dismay at the international community's failure to enforce the Geneva Conventions. They emphasized that the main obstacle for medical personnel was lack of safety, and the main need was for protection. As one explained, “You must be safe to save others . . . If you kill the physician or destroy the hospital, the medicine doesn't benefit any people. The main problem is the inability to protect the staff.” In particular, all the physicians we interviewed emphasized the priority of stopping the barrel bombs. One told us, “If the barrels stop, doctors will come back. We just need to stop the barrels; it's the first and the last thing we need.” These violations of international humanitarian law have been well documented in real time, yet the international response has been minimal. The United Nations (UN) Security Council — the international body mandated to protect civilians in conflict, enforce international humanitarian law, and refer cases to the International Criminal Court for investigation of possible war crimes — remains paralyzed by politics. It passed a single resolution in February 2014 demanding that all parties to the conflict end attacks on civilians and respect the principle of medical neutrality</span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> Since then, it has watched attacks on civilians and medical facilities increase in Syria without taking further actions. <span class='card-underline'>We believe that governments and nongovernmental organizations should call out the Security Council for failing to maintain international peace and security and ensure accountability for perpetrators, and in the event of continued failure these organizations should demand a restructuring of the Council. In addition, individual governments can step up diplomatic pressure and consider imposing sanctions against violators.</span> <span class='card-highlight'>If the international community does not mobilize to stop the attacks on Syria's medical professionals and infrastructure, civilians will continue to suffer and die</span>. In addition, lasting peace cannot be achieved unless the perpetrators of these crimes are held accountable. The effects of these violations and absence of accountability will go far beyond Syria. The longer the international community fails to enforce humanitarian law, the greater the chance that these violations will become the “new normal” in armed conflicts around the world, eroding the long-standing norm of medical neutrality. Left unchecked, attacks on medical care will become a standard weapon of war.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Syria Healthcare System under threat of Collapse</div><div class='cite'>WHO 3/14</div><div class='card-body'><p>((WHO) The World Health Organization is a specialized agency of the United Nations that is concerned with international public health.)

With the advent of genome-editing technologies, bioterrorists could artificially engineer new plagues, a threat that Ashton Carter, the former U.S. secretary of defense, thinks could <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>rival nuclear weapons in deadliness</span></span>. The two of us have advised the president of Guinea on stopping Ebola. In addition, we have worked on ways to contain the spread of Zika and have informally advised U.S. and international organizations on the matter. <span class='card-underline'>Our experiences tell us that the world is unprepared for these threats</span>. We urgently need to change this trajectory. We can start by learning four lessons from the gaps exposed by the Ebola and Zika pandemics. Faster Vaccine Development The most effective way to stop pandemics is with vaccines. However, with Ebola there was no vaccine, and only now, years later, has one proven effective. This has been the case with Zika, too. Though there has been rapid progress in developing and getting a vaccine to market, it is not fast enough, and Zika has already spread worldwide. Many other diseases do not have vaccines, and developing them takes too long when a pandemic is already under way. We need faster pipelines, such as the one that the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations is trying to create, to preemptively develop vaccines for diseases predicted to cause outbreaks in the near future. Poinkt-of-Care Diagnostics Even with such efforts, vaccines will not be ready for many diseases and would not even be an option for novel or artificially engineered pathogens. With no vaccine for Ebola, our next best strategy was to identify who was infected as quickly as possible and isolate them before they infected others. Because Ebola’s symptoms were identical to common illnesses like malaria, diagnosis required laboratory testing that could not be easily scaled. As a result, many patients were only tested after several days of being contagious and infecting others. Some were never tested at all, and about 40% of patients in Ebola treatment centers did not actually have Ebola. Many dangerous pathogens similarly require laboratory testing that is difficult to scale. Florida, for example, has not been able to expand testing for Zika, so pregnant women wait weeks to know if their babies might be affected. What’s needed are point-of-care diagnostics that, like pregnancy tests, can be used by frontline responders or patients themselves to detect infection right away, where they live. These tests already exist for many diseases, and the technology behind them is well-established. However, the process for their validation is slow and messy. Point-of-care diagnostics for Ebola, for example, were available but never used because of such bottlenecks. Greater Global Coordination <span class='card-underline'>We need stronger global coordination</span>. The <span class='card-underline'>responsibility for controlling pandemics is </span><span class='card-underline'>fragmented, spread across too many players with no unifying authority</span>. In Guinea we forged a response out of an amalgam of over 30 organizations, each of which had its own priorities. <span class='card-underline'>In Ebola’s aftermath, there have been calls for a mechanism for responding to pandemics similar to the advance planning and training that NATO has in place for its numerous members to respond to military threats in a quick, coordinated fashion</span>. This is the right thinking, but we are far from seeing it happen. The errors that allowed Ebola to become a crisis replayed with Zika, and the <span class='card-underline'>WHO, which should anchor global action, continues to suffer from a lack of credibility</span>. Stronger Local Health Systems <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>International actors are essential but </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>cannot parachute into countries and navigate local dynamics quickly enough to contain outbreaks</span></span>. In Guinea it took months to establish the ground game needed to stop the pandemic, with Ebola continuing to spread in the meantime. We need to help developing countries establish health systems that can provide routine care and, when needed, coordinate with international responders to contain new outbreaks. Local health systems could be established for about half of the $3.6 billion ultimately spent on creating an Ebola response from scratch. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Access to </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>routine care</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> is also </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>essential</span></span> for knowing when an outbreak is taking root and establishing trust. For months, Ebola spread before anyone knew it was happening, and then lingered because communities who had never had basic health care doubted the intentions of foreigners flooding into their villages. The turning point in the pandemic came when they began to trust what they were hearing about Ebola and understood what they needed to do to halt its spread: identify those exposed and safely bury the dead. <span class='card-underline'>With Ebola and Zika, we lacked</span> these four things — vaccines, diagnostics, <span class='card-underline'>global coordination, and local health systems — which are still urgently needed</span>. However, prevailing political headwinds in <span class='card-underline'>the United States</span>, which <span class='card-underline'>has played a </span><span class='card-underline'>key role in combatting pandemics around the world</span>, threaten to make things worse. The Trump administration is seeking drastic budget cuts in funding for foreign aid and scientific research. The U.S. State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development may lose over one-third of their budgets, including half of the funding the U.S. usually provides to the UN. The National Institutes of Health, which has been on the vanguard of vaccines and diagnostics research, may also face cuts. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has been at the forefront of responding to outbreaks, remains without a director, and, if the Affordable Care Act is repealed, would lose $891 million, 12% of its overall budget, provided to it for immunization programs, monitoring and responding to outbreaks, and other public health initiatives. <span class='card-underline'>Investing in our ability to prevent and contain pandemics through </span><span class='card-underline'>revitalized national</span> and international <span class='card-underline'>institutions</span> <span class='card-underline'>should be our</span> shared <span class='card-underline'>goal</span>. However, if U.S. agencies become less able to respond to pandemics, leading institutions from other nations, such as Institut Pasteur and the National Institute of Health and Medical Research in France, the Wellcome Trust and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in the UK, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs have done instrumental research and response work in previous pandemics), would need to step in to fill the void. There is no border wall against disease. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Pandemics are an existential threat on par with climate change and nuclear conflict</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>.</span> We are at a critical crossroads, where we must either take the steps needed to prepare for this threat or become even more vulnerable.

Many relevant features of the world have changed considerably, making past comparisons problematic. The modern world has better sanitation and medical research, as well as national and supra-national institutions dedicated to combating diseases. Private insurers are also interested in modelling pandemic risks.273 Set against this is the fact that modern transport and dense human population allow infections to spread much more rapidly274, and there is the potential for urban slums to serve as breeding grounds for disease.275 Unlike events such as nuclear wars, pandemics would not damage the world’s infrastructure, and initial survivors would likely be resistant to the infection.

It had been making the rounds among birds in Southeast Asia for years. An outbreak in 1997 Hong Kong and another in 2003 each called for the culling of thousands of birds and put virologists and health workers into a tizzy. Although the virus wasn't much of a threat to humans, scientists fretted over the possibility of a horrifying pandemic. Relatively few people caught the virus, but more than half of them died. What would happen if this bird flu virus made the jump to humans? What if it mutated in a way that allowed it to spread from one person to another, through tiny droplets of saliva in the air? <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>One bad spin of the genetic roulette wheel and a deadly new human pathogen would </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>spread across the globe in a matter of day</span></span><span class='card-underline'>s</span><span class='card-underline'>. With a kill rate of 60 percent, such a pandemic would be </span><span class='card-underline'>devastating</span>, to say the least. Scientists were worried, all right, but the object of their worry was somewhat theoretical. Nobody knew for certain if such a supervirus was even possible. To cause that kind of damage to the human population, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>a flu virus has to combine</span></span> two traits: <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>lethality and transmissibility</span></span>. The more <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>optimistically minded scientists argue</span></span><span class='card-underline'>d</span> <span class='card-highlight'>that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>one trait precluded the other</span></span><span class='card-highlight'>,</span> that if the bird flu acquired the ability to spread like wildfire, it would lose its ability to kill with terrifying efficiency. The virus would spread, cause some fever and sniffles, and take its place among the pantheon of ordinary flu viruses that come and go each season. The <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>optimists</span></span>, we found out last fall, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>were wrong</span></span>. Two groups of scientists working independently managed to create <span class='card-underline'>bird flu viruses</span> in the lab that <span class='card-underline'>had</span> that <span class='card-underline'>killer combination of lethality and transmissibility</span> among humans. They did it for the best reasons, of course—to find vaccines and medicines to treat a pandemic should one occur, and more generally to understand how influenza viruses work. If we're lucky, the scientists will get there before nature manages to come up with the virus herself, or before someone steals the genetic blueprints and turns this knowledge against us. Influenza is a natural killer, but we have made it our own. <span class='card-underline'>We have created the conditions for new viruses to flourish</span>—among pigs in factory farms and live animal markets and a connected world of international trade and travel—<span class='card-underline'>and</span> we've gone so far as to fabricate the virus ourselves.

In a sceptical analysis, David <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Perlmutter</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>(1998) <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>questions</span></span><span class='card-underline'> the logic of </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>'visual determinism'</span></span>, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>which argues for the role of images in policy decisions</span></span> - <span class='card-underline'>the so-called 'CNN effect'</span> which draws elected officials to the television set as they evaluate their ever-changing position in the public eye. According to Perlmutter, icons are selected and confirmed by a small section of society he calls 'discourse elites' - politicians, academics, and workers in the media. Because such privileged professionals work daily with images, control them, study them in broadsheet newspapers and believe in their effects, they tend to assume that the general public does likewise, often overestimating the familiarity of even the most famous images to the untrained or uninterested viewer. Choosing specific examples including Adams' image of General Loan in Tet and other'icons of outrage', <span class='card-underline'>he argues that</span> <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the measurable effect of</span></span> visual <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>images is small and they do not </span></span><span class='card-underline'>usually</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> overturn policy</span></span>, although, by contrast, some examples of decisions influenced by images are given in Taylor (1998: 136). So, <span class='card-underline'>while </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>many</span></span><span class='card-underline'> blamed photographs </span>like those made by Adams <span class='card-underline'>for influencing public opinion in the United States against the war in Vietnam</span>, <span class='card-underline'>Perlmutter argues for the reverse: that because public opinion was already turning against the war, it seized on the image </span>of Loan as a confirmation of its new values. <span class='card-underline'>Perlmutter's </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>warn</span></span><span class='card-underline'>ing </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>against</span></span><span class='card-underline'> an </span>exaggerated or <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>naive trust in the power of</span></span><span class='card-underline'> the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>image</span></span><span class='card-underline'> is important, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>and</span></span><span class='card-underline'> he is correct in stating that an</span> <span class='card-underline'>objective </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>measurement of</span></span><span class='card-underline'> the</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> influence of images </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>on policy decisions</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> is hard to find</span></span>. Nevertheless, his analysis does not preclude a more general awareness of certain regularly circulated photographs in society, and influence may also have more general effects than government policy decisions. Accordingly, Hariman and Lucaites (2001: 19) believe that, 'visual practices have long been important yet undervalued constituents of democratic culture precisely because they are media for emotional representation that lead to performative identification rather than rational deliberation'. I would concur that the value accorded to written documents and the official archive of materials is often denied the photographic image which, nevertheless, is so regularly witnessed that its pull on the emotions should not be dismissed. 5 Alongside his scepticism about the influence of photographs, <span class='card-underline'>another side of Perimutter's critique is based on the premise that the term icon is sometimes used rather loosely to refer to group of images of important events rather than the single famous image itself.</span> Icons of significant events may circulate widely, in the process losing captions and credits detailing the specificities of their making and becoming instead generalised symbols (Zelizer 1998: 98ý 121). <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Perlmutter</span></span> distinguishes between the discrete icons, the unique image (even though there may be many millions of copies of this image) and the generic icon. He <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>expands on one</span></span> obvious <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>example, that of images of starving</span></span> African <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>children,</span></span> to explain that there is no one photograph of malnourished children that sticks in the public memory, but rather it is a generic concept that is pulled out every time a famine appears in the news media. He explains, 'certain elements are repeated over and over, from image to image, so that varying subjects, times, and locations, the basic scene becomes a familiar staple, a visual cliche' (1998: 11). This form of selectivity has been widely recognised by <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>commentators</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>who <span class='card-underline'>have </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>criticised</span></span> the <span class='card-underline'>portrayal of Africa</span> as a homogeneous entity known almost exclusively <span class='card-underline'>as </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>a site of</span></span> crippling poverty, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>disease and</span></span> frequent natural disasters (<span class='card-underline'>Campbell 2003</span>). This may lead to an inattention to the specificities of each situation, and tends not to focus blame on the possible causes of, in this case, the <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>famine. Discussion of</span></span> multiple <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>images often leads to</span></span> questions about the possible negative effects of visual imagery, often expressed as compassion fatigue (as 6 for example in the title of Susan Moeller's 1999 work on the subject). Does repeated viewing anaesthetise the viewer against further feelings of shock, outrage and pity on seeing images of horror or pain? Perlmutter (1998: 81) speculates that 'icons of outrage' may lead not to moves to right the wrongs depicted, but to a weakened 'compassionspeak' that is merely a language of description rather than action. John Taylor (1998) refrains from blaming the media for compassion fatigue but suggests that a proliferation of imagery alone will not insure society against forgetting traumatic events, even quite soon after their occurrence. In a perceptive examination, Carolyn Dean (2003) notes the <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>tendency to condemn graphic portrayals</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>of dead, injured and dying human beings as 'pornographic', implying that they present an eroticised view of pain and suffering which is morally reprehensible as well as hinting at a prior state of affairs in which the human suffering was treated more respectfully. The classic example of this is the Holocaust, long a subject of polemic over the possibility of its representation even while its key images, of skeletal survivors, do not cease to circulate. According to Dean, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>however</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>, </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the usefulness of such </span></span><span class='card-underline'>blanket </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>condemnations</span></span><span class='card-underline'> of images</span> of horror as eroticised and commodified <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is limited.</span></span> Thus far, I have discussed the origins of icons in general terms, and picked up on the clearest examples of photographic iconicity. In a nutshell, key factors have been identified as the wide circulation of a select few images, their strong emotional pull, and possible religious connotations. I have also pinpointed the lack of attention to the regional which may prejudice the consideration of photographic icons. Where do these remarks take us when we return to Latin America, a region which, Che aside, has been largely absent from the canon of classic images? How do images interact with the issues of memory which, as discussed in the previous chapter, are crucial in post-conflict societies? In my own consideration of iconic images, I will draw on the theories outlined above. One concern, however, is that most examination of significant images has been from the viewpoint of the European or US-based observer. With few exceptions, most images were directed at principally European and North American audiences, and detailed analyses like those conducted by Perlmutter and Hariman and Lucaites are extremely valuable but focus specifically on the North American context, as well as neglecting issues of memory. While the work of Hariman and Lucaites (2007) is explicitly based firmly in the United States, it does cover famous images from Vietnam, Iwo Jima, and Tiananmen Square, but only insofar as they are viewed by and have an influence on an American audience, neglecting issues of their reception elsewhere. The relevance of their findings in Latin America must therefore be evaluated carefully, in part because there is not such widespread access in the region to television, print media and the internet. While there is a small group of images whose fame has reached internationally, each country also has iconic images that are recognised in a national context but may not be well known beyond its borders. It is beyond the scope of this thesis to provide a definitive framework for iconicity in as diverse a region as Latin America, but in my juxtaposition of Peru and Argentina and their points of convergence and divergence, I aim to draw some conclusions about the significance of the icon in the commemoration of violence in Argentina and Peru. Moreover, while each Latin American nation has a specific history and culture, many of them share issues of postdictatorial development, and this project is thus a step towards an evaluation of memory images in the subcontinent. Firstly I would concur, with Hariman and Lucaites, that the right conditions come together to create an iconic image. A composition that is familiar and recognisable to the viewing audience, perhaps involving religious connotations; an emotional appeal and a relatively clear cut moral message all contribute to the strength of the image. Perlmutter (1998) adds another important factor: metonymy. The image must have the ability to stand in for the whole situation it represents: one starving child for the plight of millions in Africa, one heap of skeletal bodies for all Holocaust victims, and so on. It must also appear at an opportune moment and with the ability to be reproduced on multiple occasions, leaving room for an element of chance and the influence of the media and publishing industries. In fact, as will be examined in depth in chapter three of this thesis, Runia (2006) emphasises the significance of metonymy in memory debates, in which iconic images, sites, and people are made to stand in for a whole historical period. The ease with which photographs circulate, often unaccredited, and the ability to assimilate them in many different ways means that they often escape closer scrutiny. Yet <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>if we are going to credit</span></span> some <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>images with the power to</span></span> provoke emotions, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>influence decisions</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, and control memory discourse, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>they deserve deeper analysis.</span></span></p><p><span class='card-underline'>If</span> disease reps cause reality, they cause <span class='card-underline'>good preparation</span>, <span class='card-underline'>not</span> securitized responses</p><p>Saksena 11</p><p>Mita – Former Lecturer, Jai Hind College, Bombay University.

This study indicates that <span class='card-underline'>the biomedical frame was the</span> pre<span class='card-underline'>dominant</span> <span class='card-underline'>frame in media reports in the sampled period 2004–2007</span> (Tables 5.4–5.9 and Figure 5.1-5.3). <span class='card-underline'>The study</span> also <span class='card-underline'>highlights</span> a <span class='card-underline'>strong correlation between the biomedical frame and the</span> American <span class='card-underline'>public’s worry</span> about <span class='card-underline'>the disease</span> and their concern about the likelihood that the disease <span class='card-underline'>would strike the United States</span>. The surveys were conducted mainly between December 2005 and in 2006 and the beginning of 2007. Figure 5.1 clearly indicates that between 2005 and the second quarter of 2007, <span class='card-underline'>the volume of </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>stories that discussed the impact of avian flu</span></span> <span class='card-underline'>on the United States and the globe as a whole </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>increased</span></span>. In the second quarter of 2007 all articles dealt with the impact of the disease on the United States. In February 2005, a news story reported that at the national meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, scientists stated that they believed it highly likely that a virus that has swept through chickens and other poultry in Asia would genetically change into a flu that can be transmitted among people.38 At the same time, Cambodia and Indonesia reported their first human cases of avian flu, which turned out to be fatal.39 By November 2005, the WHO's official count of human cases of H5N1 reached 122, with 62 deaths in Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, and Cambodia.40 This was followed by news reports of the spread of avian flu to countries such as China, the Russian Federation, Turkey, Italy, and many other countries around the globe. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>This was also a time when </span></span><span class='card-underline'>the</span> United States <span class='card-underline'>President and </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Congress launched</span></span> several <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>initiatives</span></span>. <span class='card-underline'>The</span> Pandemic and All Hazards <span class='card-underline'>Preparedness Act was adopted</span> by Congress in December 2006.

The second hypothesis tested was that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>when</span></span> the biomedical and economic <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>frames dominate</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>media <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>coverage</span></span>, which is the most common scenario, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>people will be more worried</span></span> about the disease. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>They will </span></span><span class='card-underline'>be likely to</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> support</span></span> potentially inconvenient policies intended to address the dangers of the disease.

This phenomenon results in significant socioeconomic consequences as a result of the continuous loss of practitioners and trainees as well as losing their social value and financial support to their country of origin. Many countries suffered from brain drain to variable extents particularly during the second half of the 20th century, following World War II. In contrast, many countries have markedly gained form this movement leading to remarkable development of their economy and educational systems due to the significant contributions made by the immigrating professionals to their respective fields. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Physicians’ brain drain had a substantial burden on developing countries over the past few decades due to the significant loss of medical professionals and health care providers in both clinical care and medical education fields</span></span>. For example, the number of international medical graduates (IMGs) in the United States is estimated at 245,000 according the American Medical Association (AMA) statistics in 2007, representing an approximately 25% of the entire health workforce in the nation[1,2] where physicians immigrating from lower income countries constitute 60% of all practicing IMGs. India occupies the first rank among the source countries of IMGs in the United States with an emigration factor of 10.6%. (Emigration factor is defined as the number of physicians from a source nation practicing in a recipient country divided by the total number of physicians practicing in the source country.)[1,2] This is followed by a number of countries such as Philippines, Pakistan, and some Latin America and Middle East countries such as Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon.[1,2] <span class='card-underline'>Between 2004 and 2008, the data from the AMA records indicated that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the total numbers of Syrian physicians practicing in the United States has increased</span></span><span class='card-underline'> from approximately 3200 to 3900 representing 0.4% of the health workforce and 1.6% of IMGs</span>.[1,2] The Global Health Observatory data repository reported that <span class='card-underline'>the total number of physicians in Syria was estimated at 31,000, according to the 2008 statistics, with an approximately 15 physicians per 10,000 capita.[</span><span class='card-underline'>3</span><span class='card-underline'>] This renders the emigration factor of Syrian physicians to the United States to be around 13%. A study published in</span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>Health Policy</span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>in 2007 analyzed the dynamics of international immigration patterns of physicians to the United States and found that Syria has a higher-than-expected physicians immigration rates</span>.[4] In fact, Syria was the sixth country among the top eight countries which have a higher-than-expected rate and the second Arab country after Lebanon when adjusting for the population size.[4,5] Recently, the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG) indicated in its 2010 annual report that a total of 140 certificates were issued to medical students who graduated from Syrian medical schools representing 1.5% of the total certificates issued in 2010. Also, a total of 240 exchange visiting student visas were issued for Syrian medical graduates in the 2009–2010 academic year.[6] <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Major factors contribute to this trend on physicians’ immigration from Syria including the large differences in incomes and standards of living, the scarcity and instability of professional and academic opportunities, and the “culture of emigration” among physicians in training</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. The majority of the recipient countries provide a proper professional atmosphere, better academic freedom, and flexibility with much better overall living conditions.</span> Unfortunately, some of these factors are difficult to counteract in a short-term intervention. Nevertheless, several measures can be done to increase the retention of practicing and graduating physicians or minimize the effect of brain drain on the health and medical education systems. Core modifications in health and education policy and professional atmosphere are essential to achieve broad societal changes and to reduce the rates of physicians’ emigration. Providing better academic and professional opportunities, allowing more flexibility to the health and education systems, promoting research and its infrastructure, establishing networks between professionals inside and outside the country, as well as encouraging the return of the emigrant physicians will minimize the effects of physicians’ brain drain which will ultimately improve the overall rating of the Syrian health and medical education systems.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>The United States Federal Government should increase its humanitarian aid and foreign development budgets.

It’s inhumane to make unprecedented cuts to aid like this, at a time when we are struggling to respond to multiple humanitarian crises</span>.” The United States is the largest humanitarian donor in the world. In 2016 alone, it provided $6.4 billion for emergencies - about a third of the overall $22.1 billion spent globally by aid agencies. This included distributing lifesaving food in South Sudan, preventing HIV/AIDS in Nigeria and rebuilding Afghanistan’s education system so children can return to school. But while the amount of foreign aid the US donates is high, it is less than 1 per cent of its overall federal budget. “<span class='card-underline'>The potential savings do not justify the cost in terms of the lives lost and the negative impact on vulnerable people around the world,”</span> said Charny. The Trump budget proposal states that it retains “significant funding for humanitarian assistance,” although it does not provide a detailed breakdown of specific accounts. The one humanitarian account mentioned is the $70 million Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance (ERMA), a contingency fund for rapid response to displacement crises that the budget proposal eliminates. <span class='card-underline'>Even if humanitarian aid spending is maintained but development aid is cut, this will have disastrous effects. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Development aid is vital to prevent emergencies and help societies to recover afterwards.

The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), which provides protection, shelter, water, health care, and other resources to refugees and internally displaced persons, relies heavily on this account</span>. The U.S., the world’s most powerful economy, is the UNHCR’s largest donor by far, giving almost $1.5 billion to the refugee agency; over three times that of Germany, the UNHCR’s second largest donor. U.S. funding supports programs and institutions which prevent refugees from being forcibly returned to places where their lives would be threatened, works to ensure access for humanitarian agencies to conflict zones, promotes international humanitarian and human rights law, and de-escalates conflicts which engender human displacement. <span class='card-underline'>2) </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Humanitarian aid also includes significant funding for the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program.</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>Since its inception under President Reagan in the early 1980s, the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) has taken in more refugees than any other country’s resettlement program. At times of far less need, the U.S. has done much more to address human displacement. In 1980, there were about 9 million displaced people in the world. That year, the U.S. took in 207,116 refugees. This year, as more than 65 million people are displaced around the world, the U.S. has agreed to take in only 45,000 refugees.</span><span class='card-underline'> </span>The U.S. sets an example for other countries: when the U.S. resettles refugees, other countries follow suit. This pattern, however, goes both ways; when the U.S. closes its doors to displaced persons, other countries do as well. The USRAP has historically had a strong bipartisan tradition. Opening our doors to those fleeing persecution is grounded in our country’s very founding. From its earliest years, U.S shores have represented refuge and new beginnings for those seeking safety. Resettlement is often the only option for refugees when voluntary repatriation — return to their home country — and local integration to the country they initially fled are not possible. It is critical that the USRAP continues to receive funding to work in partnership with the UNHCR, bring refugees to the U.S., and to support refugee resettlement agencies in the U.S. <span class='card-underline'>3) </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Aid goes to countries which are facing unanticipated humanitarian crises; crises which are typically refugee producing</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>Under the Department of State, the Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance (ERMA) fund is a critically important account for the global refugee crisis. ERMA is a flexible reserve fund and allows the U.S. to support unforeseen humanitarian needs without taking money away from other humanitarian priorities. In past years, the ERMA fund was drawn on to offer aid to those affected by civil unrest in Libya, support those fleeing Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and provide assistance to Syrian refugees in Jordan, Turkey, and Lebanon. If history teaches us anything, it is that we cannot predict every humanitarian crisis that arises. The least we can do is be prepared to meet these crises.</span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>4) </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Aid goes to those countries which are disproportionately shouldering the burden of the refugee crisis.</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>The U.S. would have to resettle about 3,750 refugees each month to resettle the embarrassingly low number of 45,000 refugees the President determined the U.S. could resettle this fiscal year. Halfway through FY18, the U.S. is not on track to resettle even half that number this year. Meanwhile, countries like Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon, Kenya, and Ethiopia host large numbers of refugees, disproportionate to their populations and resources. More and more, refugees are living in towns and cities. According to the UNHCR, two-thirds of refugees now live outside of camps. Host governments are scrambling to find resources to expand housing availability, improve infrastructure, and offer educational and vocational opportunities to refugees. The MRA fund, in conjunction with USAID, addresses the development issues host countries face from protracted, refugee-producing conflicts. </span>These funds recognize the new reality that refugees are likely to be displaced from their homes for generations and must build their lives in a new country. If host countries cannot adequately support their refugee populations, the escalation of economic, social, and political instability is inevitable. Thus, it is critical from both a moral and national security standpoint that the U.S. maintain its international commitments to support these countries. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Humanitarian aid has the power to mitigate the global refugee crisis by alleviating suffering, building new homes, and supporting host countries.</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span></p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Foreign aid solves the need for asylum in the US – syria proves </div><div class='cite'>IRC 17</div><div class='card-body'><p>3-16-17 International Rescue Committee “Five ways American foreign aid saves Syrian lives” https://www.rescue.org/article/five-ways-american-foreign-aid-saves-syrian-lives</p><p><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>American aid is a mighty defense against conflict, poverty and despair, especially in countries where war and violence has forced millions to flee from the places they once called home</span></span>. <span class='card-underline'>President Trump has proposed large cuts to foreign aid at a time of desperate need. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>In Syria alone, 13.5 million people require urgent humanitarian assistance, as do the 4.8 million who have fled to neighboring countries.

What happened in between—and ultimately over the past two decades—is part of an important storyline of the politics not just of foreign assistance, but of America’s global leadership. LESSONS FROM THE MARSHALL PLAN Stories of U.S. foreign aid are rarely told without a mention of U.S. Secretary of State George Marshall, considered the father of foreign assistance with the Marshall Plan. Yet the political acumen of this retired general—who served as both secretary of state and secretary of defense—is often underappreciated. As we recently marked the 70th anniversary of the plan’s announcement, few may remember that, despite its overwhelming success, the initial proposal was wildly unpopular and feverishly opposed by the Senate Majority Leader Robert Taft of Ohio and a war-weary America seeking to benefit from the peace dividend. Marshall and Secretary of Commerce Averell Harriman made it their personal mission to earn the public’s support. Without the benefit of social media, they traveled around the country for months, speaking to everyone from Rotary clubs to chambers of commerce about both the “nobleness” of the plan, but also why it was in America’s self-interest to rebuild a more stable Europe that would be a future market for American goods and a partner for peace. Recognizing the uphill battle, the State Department even established a bipartisan citizen’s commission—comprised of prominent businessmen, industrialists, academics, ambassadors, and clergy—charged with embarking on a nationwide public relations campaign. While early Gallup polls showed that more than 50 percent of Americans opposed the program, the plan eventually passed overwhelmingly in Congress. Not only was the Marshall Plan unpopular, it also suffered from two tough labels—namely “foreign” and “aid.” Yet with strong political leadership, an engaged cadre of credible messengers, and a clear message about how the policy impacted voters’ interests, the outcome was successful. Seventy years later, these political lessons still ring true. THE COLD WAR POLITICS OF FOREIGN AID <span class='card-underline'>During the Cold War, American support for robust engagement in the world held steady, with polls showing that a vast majority of Americans supported overseas programs like famine relief.</span> Unfortunately, this was the same era when negative stereotypes arose—a reminder of past aid to authoritarian rulers who were nominally allies against the Soviet Union. <span class='card-underline'>Interestingly, as the Cold War came to an end, it was President Ronald Reagan whose “peace through strength” foreign policy platform fostered strong support for foreign assistance among conservatives.</span> While Reagan may be best known for his military buildup, he recognized that “the ultimate importance to the United States of our security and development assistance programs cannot be exaggerated.” Under his leadership in 1985, the U.S. spent close to 0.6 percent of the nation’s GDP on civilian international affairs programs—the high water mark for foreign assistance spending since the Marshall Plan. THE PRE-9/11 ERA AND THE ISOLATIONIST WINDS <span class='card-underline'>By the mid-1990s, policymakers were eager to reap a “peace dividend” after the end of the Cold War. As isolationist winds were blowing through Washington, some members of Congress openly stood on the floor of the House of Representatives and bragged that they did not own a passport.</span> And the House Budget Resolution for Fiscal Year 1996 called for cutting more than 20 percent from the foreign assistance account, then totaling only $20 billion. In the Senate, Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, a self-avowed aid skeptic, proposed a radical shrinking of America’s footprint around the world—including the elimination of the U.S. Agency for International Development. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Between 1990 and 2000, foreign assistance spending declined by 20 percent</span></span><span class='card-underline'>,</span> thousands of State Department and USAID positions were eliminated, and 70 USAID missions and diplomatic posts were shuttered. USAID was ultimately saved with the concession to eliminate the U.S. Information Agency. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The threats to foreign assistance and America’s global leadership during this time were a wake-up call.</span></span> With the exception of the pro-Israel community, led by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, there was no organized effort to educate, engage, and mobilize around foreign assistance on a national scale. While there were unique efforts on specific issues, no one had tried to engage the broad array of citizen voices who cared about America’s global engagement and could convey strong domestic support for global development and diplomacy. But soon this would change. THE POLITICAL TRANSFORMATION OF FOREIGN AID <span class='card-underline'>During these tumultuous years, several important efforts were born. Through the late 1990s, the faith-based community led the wildly successful Jubilee 2000 campaign to secure debt relief for developing countries. And in the mid-2000s, Bono launched the ONE Campaign, creating a worldwide grassroots movement that, along with dozens of nongovernmental organizations, has had a critical impact in galvanizing voices in support of poverty-focused development aid.</span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>In 1995, a broad-based coalition of “strange bedfellows”—eventually known as the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition (USGLC)—took a page out of Secretary Marshall’s playbook and began to transform the politics of foreign aid</span>. In the early years, the USGLC sought to counter the isolationist tides and stop the hemorrhaging of the international affairs account. <span class='card-underline'>Today, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the USGLC works around the country building broad support for America’s global leadership</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, development, and diplomacy with a coalition of more than 500 businesses and NGOs; a bipartisan advisory council chaired by former Secretary of State Colin Powell that includes every living secretary of state; nearly 200 retired three- and four-star generals and admirals; and advocates in all 50 states.</span><span class='card-underline'> </span>While the community has weathered numerous efforts to scale back America’s civilian forces, the current proposals in Washington to slash the State Department and USAID by 32 percent present the most serious threat to America’s global leadership since the 1990s. And what many may not realize is that the historical and bipartisan groundswell of opposition that has unfolded over the past few months was actually years in the making. Here are some of the lessons learned from two decades changing the politics of foreign aid: <span class='card-underline'>1.</span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Messengers matter</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>While many forceful voices have advocated for foreign assistance over the years, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>top generals and admirals</span></span><span class='card-underline'> have perhaps been the most powerful. These seemingly unexpected allies promoting the need for civilian power have been a game changer.</span><span class='card-underline'> </span>Years ago, General Anthony Zinni, a former Commander of the U.S. Central Command, helped launch a network of now nearly 200 three- and four-star military leaders with the likes of Generals David Petraeus and Michael Hagee, Admirals James Loy and James Stavridis, and many others. These battle-tested leaders have not only lent their names, but also testified to Congress, penned op-eds, and spoken out around the country. Their national security credibility has been unmatched. <span class='card-underline'>Today, one of the most oft-cited quotes in support of our civilian forces is from then-General Jim Mattis who testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee in 2013: “If you don’t fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition.”</span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>2.</span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>Message matters</span><span class='card-underline'> </span>There is no silver bullet to ensure support from a policymaker, but what is clear is that members of Congress need the issue to be relevant back home. While lawmakers can believe that supporting America’s engagement overseas is the right thing to do, they also need the facts and figures to explain why it is the smart thing to do for our security and our economic interests. <span class='card-underline'>On the frontlines of creating jobs and driving exports, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the voices of business leaders and state chambers of commerce have been centra</span></span><span class='card-underline'>l to capturing the attention of lawmakers around the country. The economic message combined with a security and values-driven agenda has proven highly effective</span>. A few samples of the three-pronged message: National security: “The military alone cannot keep us safe.” Jobs and the economy: “95 percent of consumers live outside the United States.” Moral leadership: “America is that shining city on the hill.” <span class='card-underline'>3.</span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>Leadership matters</span><span class='card-underline'> </span>As Secretary Marshall and President Harry Truman demonstrated, leadership matters. Few have showed this better on development assistance than President George W. Bush. As a candidate who ran on a platform against “nation building,” he went on to be one of the greatest champions for global health, helping to save more than 13 million lives by launching PEPFAR (the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) and the malaria relief program. His leadership in establishing the Millennium Challenge Corporation raised the bar for strengthening foreign assistance effectiveness. The Obama administration built upon these successes, deepening our investments in public- private partnerships, aid effectiveness, and transparency, and ensuring country commitments through presidential initiatives on food security and energy. The nominated USAID administrator, Ambassador Mark Green, is well known for his leadership on smart aid reform. Leadership on these issues also includes the legislative branch. <span class='card-underline'>In the past two and a half years, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Congress passed eight significant pieces of bipartisan legislation on global development,</span></span><span class='card-underline'> ranging from food security to aid effectiveness to rights for women and girls, with sponsors from across the political spectrum.</span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>4.</span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>Local voices matter</span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>A junior member of Congress from the Midwest made a name for himself on local talk radio prior to being elected with the common refrain: “Why should we be building schools over there, when we should be building schools here at home?” Yet after this Tea Party conservative visited a USAID agriculture program in Africa, he became a staunch believer and vocal advocate for the foreign assistance budget.</span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>The congressman’s decision to go on this overseas education trip did not come from his staff, but instead from a top CEO from his state. As House Speaker Tip O’Neill once said, “All politics is local.”</span><span class='card-underline'> </span>In the past decade, the most consequential and lasting shifts in policymakers’ support for foreign assistance has come as the groundwork spread far outside the beltway. In the last election cycle alone, nearly 200 candidates met with foreign assistance advocates—groups of local business, faith, NGO, veteran, and community leaders—in their home districts. These meetings, led by highly influential supporters of foreign assistance, have been critical in both educating skeptics and reinforcing champions, showcasing the strength of constituent support for global development. <span class='card-underline'>5.</span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>Local platforms matter</span><span class='card-underline'> </span>Members of Congress not only need to hear this support, but they also need to feel it tangibly. A decade ago, the USGLC launched what has become a signature program—local statewide events that provide a platform for lawmakers to engage directly with their constituents on how America’s role in the world directly impacts their communities. Several years ago, the USGLC hosted an event for a newly elected senator in his home state. The room was packed with hundreds of his constituents. Just before he was introduced, the senator leaned over to me and said, “My constituents don’t like foreign assistance.” Once on stage, sandwiched between a prominent retired four-star general and a well-respected former diplomat, the senator found a different voice. With the political cover to his left and right, he started singing off of our song sheet, boldly telling the supportive crowd why aid was directly in America’s national security, economic, and humanitarian interests. Time and again, these <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>local programs have provided an opportunity for policymakers to speak out and the words spoken outside the beltway have translated into positives votes and action back in Washington. While isolationist winds may have returned to Washington in recent days, there are very different speeches being made on the House floor compared with two decades ago.</span></span><span class='card-underline'> In fact, more than 200 members of Congress from the Freedom Caucus to the Progressive Caucus have gone on the record opposing the proposal to cut the State Department and USAID by a third.</span><span class='card-underline'> </span>There is no shortage of political challenges in the coming months and years. In addition to the proposed cuts, polls taken year after year still underscore the misinformation about the size of the small 1 percent of the federal budget that is dedicated to foreign assistance. Most surveys suggest that Americans believe aid accounts for more than a quarter of the federal budget, and polling in the Heartland showed deeper concerns just last year. <span class='card-underline'>But what has changed is that the many voices in our society who understand the stakes of America’s global leadership and the value of foreign assistance are speaking up—educating, engaging, and mobilizing. Members of Congress are not naïve—they see the complexities of the world, from threats of pandemics to famine to terrorism. Yet sometimes they also need a political embrace and a “thank you” for their leadership. And it is clear that today there is a growing chorus of voices doing just that.</span></p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'><span class='card-highlight'>1) No impact - The US has exhausted its obligations to TPS recipients—they knew they were temporary when they accepted the protections</span></div><div class='cite'><span class='card-highlight'>Ira </span><span class='card-highlight'>Mehlman</span>, media director at the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), 10/26/2017</div><div class='card-body'><p>[“Temporary status for immigrants shouldn't mean permanent residency,”</p><p>http://thehill.com/opinion/immigration/357305-temporary-status-for-immigrants-shouldnt-mean-permanent-residency CBO DUDA]</p><p>Between now and Jan. 18, the deadlines for extending or terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for 90 percent of all foreign nationals who hold that status will elapse. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>In complete disregard for the fact that the "T" in TPS stands for temporary, some 300,000 citizens of Honduras, El Salvador, and Haiti, have been allowed to remain and work in the United States as a result of natural disasters that struck those countries</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> — </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>as long ago as </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>1998 in the case of Honduras</span></span>.

The decision is part of President Trump’s “America first” agenda, restricting the rights of immigrants in order to protect U.S. workers. <span class='card-underline'>But, as previous immigration experiments demonstrate, the policy</span> will not aid American workers. And it <span class='card-underline'>certainly won’t make Salvadorans pack their bags</span>. Trump’s order is likely to have the opposite effects. President George W. Bush granted Salvadorans temporary protected status (TPS) after devastating earthquakes hit El Salvador in 2001. He and President Barack Obama repeatedly extended the status. Beyond its humanitarian impact, TPS provides significant economic benefits. It doesn’t give applicants access to any federal welfare — so there are few costs — but it does grant the legal right to work. And Salvadorans with TPS work at very high rates: Eighty-eight percent participate in the labor force, compared with 63 percent of all Americans. Legal employment has helped Salvadorans achieve a relatively high standard of living. The median household income for Salvadorans with TPS is $50,000, higher than the roughly $36,000 for unauthorized immigrants. Their higher wages, combined with the lack of public benefits, has been a big win for U.S. taxpayers. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Canceling TPS will make it illegal for these Salvadorans to work, but it’s unlikely to force them home. In 1990, President George H.W. Bush granted TPS to some </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>185,000</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> Salvadorans during the country’s civil war, and when President Bill Clinton canceled their status in 1996, </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>few</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> returned.

At this point, 28 years since the original TPS designation and 17 years since the subsequent one, the incentives to stay will be too large for any mass migration back to El Salvador</span></span>.

Further, the dehumanizing propaganda wasn’t widely received in the majority of places where Tutsis were killed. Only 10 percent of Rwandans owned radio transmitters in 1994, and broadcast range had little reach in rural areas while genocide was national. “<span class='card-underline'>Hate radio” can’t explain why violence occurred almost everywhere</span>.

MFLTS stands for <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Machine Foreign Language Translation System</span></span> and is “the overarching Army Program with Department of Defense interest” to provide soldiers with machine translations via speech and text, explained MFLTS Product Director Michael Beaulieu in a presentation back in 2012. An unclassified document Slator saw showed the projected total spend on MFLTS Research, Development, Test & Evaluation from 2013-16 amounted to USD 12.5m as of 2014. The program primarily comprises machine translation, automatic speech recognition, and optical character recognition. If one were to speculate just going by the screen grabs from Beaulieu’s presentation (shown below), the MFLTS works with, at least, two possible vendors; US defense contractor Raytheon for speech-to-speech and SDL for text-to-text.

They're the kind of people Rye Barcott depended on. He's a former Marine captain who served in Iraq. For Barcott, there's no substitute for having a flesh-and-blood interpreter by your side when you're gathering intelligence, specifically, a trusted linguist who can translate all aspects of a conversation – the verbal and the non-verbal. But as Barcott points out, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>few units</span></span>, especially in the infantry, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>have access to human interpreters</span></span>. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Machine translation could help</span></span>, with basic information at least. "When a Marine or Army unit's out patrolling and they need to ask a person for permission to enter their property for example, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>it's far better to have a machine</span></span> than to not have anything," Barcott said. In recent years, the US military has adopted a policy of trying to give everyone who deploys some knowledge, something to hang their hat on. "Hello. And thank you for your interest in learning more about V Communicator Mobile – the first deployed and fielded mobile military application." This is one of a <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>growing range of products out there designed to bridge the military language gap</span></span>. Ernie Bright is the product manager for V Communicator Mobile, which runs on a modified iPod Touch. Bright said the focus was on assisting soldiers, not distracting them. "We knew that they were needing a more mobile easy-to-use product that would allow them to learn key tactical phrases, and also be able to just pick it up and use it," Bright said. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>It's impressive, quickly translating a phrase</span></span> such as 'do you have any weapons?' into the equivalent language in, say, Pashto. But it's not the only translation device out there vying for a potentially lucrative military contract. Another mobile app is called SpeechTrans. According to the company's co-founder, Yan Auerbach, "It allows you to speak into the device in your native language; it will translate and speak aloud the translation instantly." Dialects It's equally impressive. SpeechTrans draws on an archive of voice samples, but it doesn't yet cover every language or – crucially with languages such as Arabic – every dialect. Yan Auerbach tells me his company is now in the running for a Pentagon project called BOLT (Boundless Operational Language Translation). The goal for BOLT is lofty: technology that would recognize not just dialects but localized slang too. That still leaves a lot of missing information: gestures and body language. It's something Ernie Bright and the V Communicator Mobile team have been thinking about. On their device, attention is paid to non-verbal communication too. For every piece of language you get an animated video, demonstrating the appropriate gesture. It's meant to help soldiers learn the language too. "They can remember that this phrase coincides with this gesture or this body language," said Bright. Interpreting gestures That's fine for stock phrases at checkpoints and the like. But soldiers have to interpret gestures as much as they have to reproduce them. And they have to do it in the blink of an eye. Could a machine ever do that work too? When it comes to translation technology, no-one yet knows where the lines will be drawn. All languages – all communications – are built on ever-shifting sands of meaning. That <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>meaning can't ever be fully, totally captured by technology</span></span>. But <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>as translation tech accelerates it might fool us into believing otherwise</span></span>. And so for the military the dream of a universal translating machine will be ever-more tantalizing.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Translators fail</div><div class='cite'>Ron Synovitz 8, senior correspondent for RFE/RL, “Mistakes By Afghan Translators Endanger Lives, Hamper Antiterrorism Effort”, https://www.rferl.org/a/Mistakes_By_Translators_Hamper_Afghan_Antiterrorism_Campaign/1195783.html</div><div class='card-body'><p>When <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>U.S. or NATO soldiers</span></span> need to communicate with Afghan villagers, they <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>rely on translators</span></span> provided by private contractors. But <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>for various reasons -- regional dialects, cultural misunderstandings, or even ethnic animosities -- translators in Afghanistan often don't relate everything</span></span> they hear. And <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>what is lost in translation can hurt efforts</span></span> by NATO and the U.S.-led coalition to win the hearts and minds of the Afghan people. In the worst cases, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>innocent civilians can be arrested or wrongly targeted</span></span> as Taliban fighters. Zalmai Zurmutai, a Pashto translator for NATO troops in Afghanistan, is angry about what he has seen happen when <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>unqualified translators serve as a liaison</span></span> between foreign troops and Afghan villagers. For example, Zurmutai says, when a Dari speaker from northern Afghanistan is sent out with NATO troops to Pashtun parts of southern Afghanistan, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>it is not unusual for the translator to have difficulties</span></span> understanding the local Pashto dialect. Other times, Zurmutai says, a young Afghan translator who has grown up in Europe or the United States does not understand the traditional tribal culture of Pashtun villagers. 'Unable To Convey The Meaning' <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Local animosities also can come into play</span></span>. When a translator is from a tribe or ethnic group that suffered under the rule of the Pashtun-dominated Taliban regime, Zurmutai says <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>some</span></span> <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>treat</span></span> Pashtun village <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>elders with contempt</span></span> -- the kind of behavior that can <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>turn an entire village against the foreign troops</span></span>. "If you go to [the provinces of] Kandahar or Oruzgun or Zabol or Paktia, most people can't understand Dari," Zurmutai says. "And if you go to Badakhshan or Takhar, they don't speak Pashto and they can't understand it. Imagine when a [native Dari speaker] becomes a translator and goes into a Pashtun village where the people cannot speak Dari -- and the translator cannot understand [their local dialect of] Pashto. "Unfortunately, there are so many translators like this who are unable to convey the meaning of Pashto speakers to the coalition forces. And he can't convoy the message of foreign troops to these local people," Zurmutai continues. "There also are some Afghan translators who are coming from other countries who are less familiar with the Afghan culture. They don't know about the tribal value system. Or there are some emotional young Afghans who don't care about the local values. They have very rude behavior -- very [undiplomatic and] cruel -- without respect for people. They are creating misunderstandings between local people and the coalition forces. They are destroying mutual trust. There are some translators who are working for their own political, personal and tribal interests. These translators are treating people in a very bad way." John McHugh is an independent filmmaker whose documentary "Lost In Translation -- Afghanistan" was released on the Internet this summer by The Guardian newspaper group. Filmed while McHugh was embedded with U.S. troops near the Afghan-Pakistan border, the eight-minute documentary shows how tensions rise between U.S. soldiers and Pashtun villagers when a Dari-speaking translator is unable to understand a village elder's Waziri dialect. 'Is It Any Wonder?' The elder gives lengthy answers to the U.S. soldiers' questions about the lack of security in their village and the threats against them by Taliban fighters who regularly cross the nearby border with Pakistan. The <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>translator fails to convey</span></span> the elder's <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>concerns</span></span>. "The soldiers ask to speak to the village elders, but everything gets lost in translation," McHugh says. "Everything here hinges on the translation -- the subtleties of Pashto and English. The translators have become unexpected power brokers in all this. And sometimes, they just don't translate everything they hear. Is it any wonder that the Americans feel baffled in these situations and that ordinary Afghans feel ignored?" Zurmutai says there are <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>many misunderstandings during NATO military operations in Afghanistan that are caused by bad translations</span></span>. Zurmutai described one case in which a translator wrongly told NATO troops that an encampment of Pashtun nomads -- a Kochi tribe -- were Taliban fighters. He says it was only the last-minute intervention of another translator that stopped NATO from calling in an air strike on the tents of the innocent nomads. "Unfortunately, we can't deny that there are tribal and regional differences between Afghans today. And translators are involved in this stuff," Zurmutai says. "Many translators have been sacked because of creating these kinds of conflicts. Recently, so many people have been killed in mistaken bombardments that were later found to be the result of bad translations. "Nowadays, coalition forces understand that the real source of the problem is with the translators. And they are paying more attention to this issue," he continues. "If this problem would be solved, it would be a major step forward for reconstruction and for bringing peace and stability to Afghanistan." Security Criteria U.S. and NATO military officials in Afghanistan have admitted to RFE/RL privately that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>inaccurate translations cause problems for their soldiers</span></span>, whether in a battle situation or simply communicating with members of a rural Afghan community.

In 1946, atomic bomb maker J. Robert <span class='card-underline'>Oppenheimer</span> ominously <span class='card-underline'>warned that</span> if three or four men could smuggle in units for <span class='card-underline'>an atomic bomb</span>, they <span class='card-underline'>could blow up New York. This</span> <span class='card-underline'>was an early expression of a pattern of dramatic risk inflation</span> that has persisted throughout the nuclear age. In fact, although expanding fires and fallout might increase the effective destructive radius, <span class='card-underline'>the blast of a Hiroshima-size device would “blow up</span>” about <span class='card-underline'>1% of the city’s area</span>—a tragedy, of course, but not the same as one 100 times greater. In the early 1970s, nuclear physicist Theodore Taylor proclaimed the atomic terrorist problem to be “immediate,” explaining at length “how comparatively easy it would be to steal nuclear material and step by step make it into a bomb.” At the time he thought it was already too late to “prevent the making of a few bombs, here and there, now and then,” or “in another ten or fifteen years, it will be too late.” Three decades after Taylor, <span class='card-underline'>we continue to wait for terrorists to carry out their “easy” task</span>. <span class='card-underline'>In contrast to</span> these <span class='card-underline'>predictions, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>terrorist groups</span></span> seem to <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>have exhibited</span></span><span class='card-underline'> only </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>limited desire and</span></span><span class='card-underline'> even </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>less </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>progress</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> in going</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>atomic</span></span>. This may be because, after brief exploration of the possible routes, they, unlike generations of alarmists, have discovered that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the</span></span><span class='card-underline'> tremendous </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>effort</span></span><span class='card-underline'> required </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is scarcely likely to be successful</span></span>. The most plausible route for terrorists, according to most experts, would be to manufacture an atomic device themselves from purloined fissile material (plutonium or, more likely, highly enriched uranium). This task, however, remains a daunting one, requiring that a considerable series of difficult hurdles be conquered and in sequence. Outright <span class='card-underline'>armed </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>theft of fissile material is</span></span><span class='card-underline'> exceedingly </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>unlikely</span></span><span class='card-underline'> not only </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>because of the resistance of guards</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, but because chase would be immediate</span>. A more promising approach would be to corrupt insiders to smuggle out the required substances. However, <span class='card-underline'>this requires the terrorists to pay off a host of greedy confederates</span>, including brokers and money-transmitters, <span class='card-underline'>any one of whom could turn on them or</span>, either out of guile or incompetence, <span class='card-underline'>furnish them with stuff that is useless</span>. Insiders might also consider the possibility that once the heist was accomplished, the terrorists would, as analyst Brian Jenkins none too delicately puts it, “have every incentive to cover their trail, beginning with eliminating their confederates.” <span class='card-underline'>If terrorists were somehow successful at obtaining</span> a sufficient mass of <span class='card-underline'>relevant material, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>they would</span></span> then probably <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>have to transport it a </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>long distance</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> over </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>unfamiliar terrain</span></span> and probably <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>while being pursued by security forces</span></span>. Crossing international borders would be facilitated by following established <span class='card-underline'>smuggling routes</span>, but these <span class='card-underline'>are not as chaotic as they appear and are</span> often <span class='card-underline'>under the watch of suspicious and careful criminal regulators</span>. If border personnel became suspicious of the commodity being smuggled, some of them might find it in their interest to disrupt passage, perhaps to collect the bounteous reward money that would probably be offered by alarmed governments once the uranium theft had been discovered. <span class='card-underline'>Once outside the country</span> with their precious booty, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>terrorists would need to set up a large and well-equipped</span></span><span class='card-underline'> machine </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>shop</span></span><span class='card-underline'> to manufacture a bomb and then to populate it </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>with</span></span><span class='card-underline'> a very select team of </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>highly skilled scientists</span></span>, technicians, machinists, and administrators. <span class='card-underline'>The group would have to be assembled and retained for the monumental task while no consequential suspicions were generated</span> among friends, family, and police about their curious and sudden absence from normal pursuits back home. <span class='card-underline'>Members of the bomb-building team</span> would also have to be utterly devoted to the cause, of course, and they <span class='card-underline'>would have to be willing to put their lives</span> and certainly their careers <span class='card-underline'>at high risk</span>, because after their bomb was discovered or exploded they would probably become the targets of an intense worldwide dragnet operation. Some observers have insisted that it would be easy for terrorists to assemble a crude bomb if they could get enough fissile material. But Christoph Wirz and Emmanuel Egger, two senior physicists in charge of nuclear issues at Switzerland‘s Spiez Laboratory, bluntly conclude that <span class='card-underline'>the task “could hardly be accomplished by a subnational group</span>.” They point out that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>precise blueprints</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> are required</span></span>, not just sketches and general ideas, and that <span class='card-underline'>even with a good blueprint the terrorist group would</span> most certainly <span class='card-underline'>be forced to redesign</span>. They also stress that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the work is</span></span><span class='card-underline'> difficult, dangerous, and extremely exacting</span>, and that the <span class='card-underline'>technical requirements</span> in several fields <span class='card-underline'>verge on the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>unfeasible</span></span>. Stephen Younger, former director of nuclear weapons research at Los Alamos Laboratories, has made a similar argument, pointing out that <span class='card-underline'>uranium is “exceptionally difficult to machine</span>” whereas “<span class='card-underline'>plutonium is one of the most complex metals ever discovered</span>, a material whose basic properties are sensitive to exactly how it is processed.“ Stressing the “daunting problems associated with material purity, machining, and a host of other issues,” Younger concludes, “<span class='card-underline'>to think that a terrorist group, working in isolation with an unreliable supply of electricity and little access to tools and supplies” could fabricate a bomb “is farfetched at best</span>.” <span class='card-underline'>Under the best circumstances,</span> <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the process</span></span><span class='card-underline'> of making a bomb </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>could take</span></span> months or even <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>a year</span></span><span class='card-underline'> or more, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>which would</span></span>, of course, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>have to be carried out in</span></span><span class='card-underline'> utter </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>secrecy</span></span>. In addition, people in the area, including criminals, may observe with increasing curiosity and puzzlement the constant coming and going of technicians unlikely to be locals. <span class='card-underline'>If the effort to build a bomb was successful, the finished product, weighing a ton</span> or more, <span class='card-underline'>would then have to be transported to and smuggled into the relevant target country where it would have to be received by collaborators who are</span> at once <span class='card-underline'>totally dedicated and technically proficient</span> at handling, maintaining, detonating, and perhaps assembling the weapon after it arrives. <span class='card-underline'>The financial costs</span> of this extensive and extended operation <span class='card-underline'>could</span> easily <span class='card-underline'>become monumental. There would be expensive equipment to buy, smuggle, and set up and people to pay or pay off</span>. Some operatives might work for free out of utter dedication to the cause, but the <span class='card-underline'>vast conspiracy</span> also <span class='card-underline'>requires</span> the subversion of <span class='card-underline'>a considerable array of criminals</span> and opportunists, <span class='card-underline'>each of whom has every incentive to push the price for cooperation as high as possible</span>. Any criminals competent and capable enough to be effective allies are also likely to be both smart enough to see boundless opportunities for extortion and psychologically equipped by their profession to be willing to exploit them. Those who warn about the likelihood of a terrorist bomb contend that a terrorist group could, if with great difficulty, overcome each obstacle and that doing so in each case is “not impossible.” But <span class='card-underline'>although it may not be impossible to surmount each individual step, the likelihood that a group could surmount a series of them quickly becomes vanishingly small</span>. Table 1 attempts to catalogue the barriers that must be overcome under the scenario considered most likely to be successful. In contemplating the task before them, would-be <span class='card-underline'>atomic terrorists</span> would effectively be required to go though an exercise that looks much like this. If and when they do, they <span class='card-underline'>will undoubtedly conclude that their prospects are</span> daunting and accordingly uninspiring or even <span class='card-underline'>terminally dispiriting</span>. It is possible to calculate the chances for success. <span class='card-underline'>Adopting probability estimates that</span> purposely and <span class='card-underline'>heavily bias</span> the case <span class='card-underline'>in the terrorists’ favor</span>—for example, assuming the terrorists have a 50% chance of overcoming each of the 20 obstacles—the chances that a concerted effort would be successful comes out to be less than one in a million. If one assumes, somewhat more realistically, that their chances at each barrier are one in three, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the</span></span><span class='card-underline'> cumulative </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>odds that they will be able to pull off the deed drop to </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>one in</span></span><span class='card-underline'> well over </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>three billion</span></span>. <span class='card-underline'>Other routes</span> would-be <span class='card-underline'>terrorists might take to acquire a bomb are even more problematic. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>They are unlikely to be given or sold a bomb</span></span> by a generous like-minded nuclear state for delivery abroad <span class='card-underline'>because the risk would be high</span>, even for a country led by extremists, <span class='card-underline'>that the bomb (and its source) would be discovered</span> even before delivery or that it would be exploded in a manner and on a target the donor would not approve, including on the donor itself. Another concern would be that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the terrorist group might be infiltrated</span></span><span class='card-underline'> by foreign intelligence</span>. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The</span></span><span class='card-underline'> terrorist </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>group might</span></span> also seek to <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>steal</span></span><span class='card-underline'> or illicitly purchase </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>a “</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>loose nuke</span></span>“ somewhere. However, it seems probable that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>none exist</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. All governments have an intense interest in controlling any weapons on their territory</span> because of fears that they might become the primary target. Moreover, as technology has developed, <span class='card-underline'>finished </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>bombs have been out-fitted with devices that</span></span> trigger a non-nuclear explosion that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>destroys the bomb </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>if</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> it is </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>tampered with</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. And there are other security techniques</span>: Bombs can be kept disassembled with the component parts stored in separate high-security vaults, and a process can be set up in which two people and <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>multiple codes are required</span></span><span class='card-underline'> not only to use the bomb but to store, maintain, and deploy it</span>. As Younger points out, “only a few people in the world have the knowledge to cause an unauthorized detonation of a nuclear weapon.” There could be dangers in the chaos that would emerge <span class='card-underline'>if a nuclear state were to utterly collapse</span>; Pakistan is frequently cited in this context and sometimes North Korea as well. However, even under such conditions, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>nuclear weapons would</span></span> probably <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>remain under heavy guard</span></span> by people who know that a purloined bomb might be used in their own territory. <span class='card-underline'>They would still have locks and, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>in</span></span> the case of <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Pakistan, the weapons would be disassembled</span></span>. The al Qaeda factor <span class='card-underline'>The degree to which al Qaeda</span>, the only terrorist group that seems to want to target the United States, <span class='card-underline'>has pursued or even has much interest in a nuclear weapon may have been exaggerated</span>. The 9/11 Commission stated that “al Qaeda has tried to acquire or make nuclear weapons for at least ten years,” but the only substantial evidence it supplies comes from an episode that is supposed to have taken place about 1993 in Sudan, when al Qaeda members may have sought to purchase some uranium that turned out to be bogus. Information about this supposed venture apparently comes entirely from Jamal al Fadl, who defected from al Qaeda in 1996 after being caught stealing $110,000 from the organization. Others, including the man who allegedly purchased the uranium, assert that although there were various other scams taking place at the time that may have served as grist for Fadl, <span class='card-underline'>the uranium episode never happened</span>. As a key indication of al Qaeda’s desire to obtain atomic weapons, many have focused on a set of conversations in Afghanistan in August 2001 that two Pakistani nuclear scientists reportedly had with Osama bin Laden and three other al Qaeda officials. Pakistani intelligence officers characterize the discussions as “academic” in nature. It seems that the discussion was wide-ranging and rudimentary and that the scientists provided no material or specific plans. Moreover, the <span class='card-underline'>scientists</span> probably <span class='card-underline'>were incapable of providing truly helpful information because their expertise was not in bomb design</span> but in the processing of fissile material, <span class='card-underline'>which is</span> almost <span class='card-underline'>certainly beyond the capacities of a nonstate group</span>. Kalid Sheikh Mohammed, the apparent planner of the 9/11 attacks, reportedly says that <span class='card-underline'>al Qaeda’s bomb efforts never went beyond searching the Internet</span>. After the fall of the Taliban in 2001, technical experts from the CIA and the Department of Energy examined documents and other information that were uncovered by intelligence agencies and the media in Afghanistan. They uncovered no credible information that al Qaeda had obtained fissile material or acquired a nuclear weapon. Moreover, they found no evidence of any radioactive material suitable for weapons. They did uncover, however, a “nuclear-related” document discussing “openly available concepts about the nuclear fuel cycle and some weapons-related issues.” Just a day or two before al Qaeda was to flee from Afghanistan in 2001, bin Laden supposedly told a Pakistani journalist, “If the United States uses chemical or nuclear weapons against us, we might respond with chemical and nuclear weapons. We possess these weapons as a deterrent.” Given the military pressure that they were then under and taking into account the evidence of the primitive or more probably nonexistent nature of al Qaeda’s nuclear program, <span class='card-underline'>the reported assertions</span>, although unsettling, <span class='card-underline'>appear at best to be a desperate bluff</span>. Bin Laden has made statements about nuclear weapons a few other times. Some of these pronouncements can be seen to be threatening, but they are rather coy and indirect, indicating perhaps something of an interest, but not acknowledging a capability. And as terrorism specialist Louise Richardson observes, “<span class='card-underline'>Statements claiming a right to possess nuclear weapons have been misinterpreted</span> as expressing a determination to use them. <span class='card-underline'>This</span> in turn <span class='card-underline'>has fed the exaggeration of the threat we face</span>.” Norwegian researcher Anne Stenersen concluded after an exhaustive study of available materials that, although “it is likely that al Qaeda central has considered the option of using non-conventional weapons,” <span class='card-underline'>there is “little evidence that</span> such <span class='card-underline'>ideas ever developed into actual plans</span>, or that they were given any kind of priority at the expense of more traditional types of terrorist attacks.” She also notes that information on an al Qaeda computer left behind in Afghanistan in 2001 indicates that only $2,000 to <span class='card-underline'>$4,000 was earmarked for weapons of mass destruction research</span> and that <span class='card-underline'>the money was</span> mainly <span class='card-underline'>for</span> very crude work on <span class='card-underline'>chemical weapons</span>. Today, the key portions of al Qaeda central may well total only a few hundred people, apparently assisting the Taliban’s distinctly separate, far larger, and very troublesome insurgency in Afghanistan. Beyond this tiny band, there are thousands of sympathizers and would-be jihadists spread around the globe. They mainly connect in Internet chat rooms, engage in radicalizing conversations, and variously dare each other to actually do something. <span class='card-underline'>Any “threat</span>,” particularly to the West, <span class='card-underline'>appears</span>, then, <span class='card-underline'>principally to derive from self-selected people</span>, often isolated from each other, <span class='card-underline'>who fantasize about performing dire deeds</span>. From time to time some of these people, or ones closer to al Qaeda central, actually manage to do some harm. And occasionally, they may even be able to pull off something large, such as 9/11. But in most cases, <span class='card-underline'>their capacities and schemes</span>, or alleged schemes, <span class='card-underline'>seem to be far less dangerous than initial press reports vividly, even hysterically, suggest</span>. Most important for present purposes, however, is that <span class='card-underline'>any notion that al Qaeda has the capacity to acquire nuclear weapons, even if it wanted to, looks farfetched in the extreme</span>. It is also noteworthy that, although there have been plenty of terrorist attacks in the world since 2001, all have relied on conventional destructive methods. For the most part, terrorists seem to be heeding the advice found in a memo on an al Qaeda laptop seized in Pakistan in 2004: “Make use of that which is available … rather than waste valuable time becoming despondent over that which is not within your reach.” In fact, <span class='card-underline'>history consistently demonstrates that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>terrorists prefer</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>weapons</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> that </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>they know</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and understand, not new, exotic ones</span>. Glenn Carle, a 23-year CIA veteran and once its deputy intelligence officer for transnational threats, warns, “<span class='card-underline'>We must not take fright at the specter our leaders have exaggerated</span>. In fact, <span class='card-underline'>we must see jihadists for the small, lethal, disjointed, and miserable opponents that they are</span>.” al Qaeda, he says, has only a handful of individuals capable of planning, organizing, and leading a terrorist organization, and although the group has threatened attacks with nuclear weapons, “<span class='card-underline'>its capabilities are far inferior to its desires</span>.” Policy alternatives The purpose here has not been to argue that policies designed to inconvenience the atomic terrorist are necessarily unneeded or unwise. Rather, in contrast with the many who insist that <span class='card-underline'>atomic terrorism</span> under current conditions is rather likely— indeed, exceedingly likely—to come about, I have contended that it <span class='card-underline'>is hugely unlikely</span>. However, it is important to consider not only the likelihood that an event will take place, but also its consequences. Therefore, one must be concerned about catastrophic events even if their probability is small, and efforts to reduce that likelihood even further may well be justified. <span class='card-underline'>At some point</span>, however, <span class='card-underline'>probabilities become so low that</span>, even for catastrophic events, <span class='card-underline'>it may make sense to ignore them</span> or at least put them on the back burner; in short, <span class='card-underline'>the risk becomes acceptable</span>. For example, the British could at any time attack the United States with their submarine-launched missiles and kill millions of Americans, far more than even the most monumentally gifted and lucky terrorist group. Yet the risk that this potential calamity might take place evokes little concern; essentially it is an acceptable risk. Meanwhile, Russia, with whom the United States has a rather strained relationship, could at any time do vastly more damage with its nuclear weapons, a fully imaginable calamity that is substantially ignored. In constructing what he calls “a case for fear,” Cass Sunstein, a scholar and current Obama administration official, has pointed out that if there is a yearly probability of 1 in 100,000 that terrorists could launch a nuclear or massive biological attack, the risk would cumulate to 1 in 10,000 over 10 years and to 1 in 5,000 over 20. These odds, he suggests, are “not the most comforting.” Comfort, of course, lies in the viscera of those to be comforted, and, as he suggests, many would probably have difficulty settling down with odds like that. But <span class='card-underline'>there must be some point at which the concerns</span> even of these people <span class='card-underline'>would ease</span>. Just perhaps <span class='card-underline'>it is at</span> one of the levels suggested above: one in a million or <span class='card-underline'>one in three billion</span> per attempt.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>No risk or impact to nuclear terror – way too many barriers </div><div class='cite'>Eaves 16 - Masters degree in international affairs from the School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University (Elizabeth, “What Does "Nuclear Terrorism" Really Mean?” The Bulletin, 4/7,  http://thebulletin.org/what-does-nuclear-terrorism-really-mean9309)</div><div class='card-body'><p><span class='card-underline'>Least likely: a nuclear weapon</span>. The reason the first scenario is improbable <span class='card-underline'>is</span> that <span class='card-underline'>it’s difficult to steal, buy, or make a nuclear weapon</span>.

In 2013, though, <span class='card-underline'>political scientists Keir A.

As for building an atomic weapon, <span class='card-underline'>it’s unlikely that terrorists could make anything as sophisticated as the warheads owned by governments,</span> but making a crude nuclear bomb—an improvised nuclear device, or IND—is “potentially within the capabilities of a technically sophisticated terrorist group,” according to the Belfer Center report.

Highly enriched </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>uranium is present in fewer than 25 countri</span></span><span class='card-underline'>es,</span> according to a new report from the Nuclear Threat Initiative. <span class='card-underline'>Even Al Qaeda</span>, which in the 1990s and early 2000s had deep pockets, a centralized command structure, and many scientists in its employ, <span class='card-underline'>was not able to acquire material suitable for a nuclear weapon despite its best efforts.</span> <span class='card-underline'>There have been reports of </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>attempts to sell nuclear material</span></span><span class='card-underline'> in countries in the Black Sea area, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>but none has been successful</span></span>, as far as has been made publicly known. Most likely: a dirty bomb. None of this is to suggest that the international community shouldn’t worry about the world’s nuclear arsenals; we would all be unequivocally safer if there were fewer atomic weapons and less nuclear-weapon-ready material around. But we’re far more likely to see the second scenario—<span class='card-underline'>a dirty bomb</span> attack—than a nuclear explosion in the near future. So what <span class='card-underline'>will</span> that <span class='card-underline'>look</span> like? <span class='card-underline'>Nothing like the aftermath of a nuclear weapon attack.</span> As the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission explains, “A dirty bomb is in no way similar to a nuclear weapon.” The latter relies on fission or fusion to create an explosion millions of times more powerful than the former. A nuclear bomb could spread radiation over hundreds of square miles, whereas <span class='card-underline'>a dirty bomb could only do so over a few square miles</span>. Dirty bombs have more in common with nuclear medicine than nuclear war. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>A dirty bomb wouldn’t </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>immediately kill any more people</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> than an ordinary explosive</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> It is a weapon ideally suited to terrorism, though, part of the very purpose of which is to sow fear. In fact, in the perverse psychology of terrorism, a mere claim that a bomb had spread radioactive material would have some of the same effect as a bomb that actually did so.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>No risk of nuclear terrorism---too many obstacles</div><div class='cite'>John J.

Our cybervulnerabilities are undoubtedly grave and <span class='card-underline'>the threats we face are severe but far from comparable to nuclear war</span>. ¶ The most recent alarms come in a Defense Science Board report on how to make military cybersystems more resilient against advanced threats (in short, Russia or China). It warned that the "cyber threat is serious, with potential consequences similar in some ways to the nuclear threat of the Cold War." Such fears were also expressed by Adm. Mike Mullen, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in 2011. He called cyber "The single biggest existential threat that's out there" because "cyber actually more than theoretically, can attack our infrastructure, our financial systems."¶ <span class='card-underline'>While it is true that cyber attacks might do these things, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>it is</span></span><span class='card-underline'> also </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>true they have</span></span><span class='card-underline'> not only </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>never happened</span></span><span class='card-underline'> but are far more difficult to accomplish than mainstream thinking believes</span>. The consequences from <span class='card-underline'>cyber threats may be similar in some ways to nuclear</span>, as the Science Board concluded, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>but mostly, they are incredibly dissimilar</span></span>. ¶ Eighty years ago, the generals of the U.S. Army Air Corps were sure that their bombers would easily topple other countries and cause their populations to panic, claims which did not stand up to reality. <span class='card-underline'>A study of the 25-year history of cyber conflict</span>, by the Atlantic Council and Cyber Conflict Studies Association, <span class='card-underline'>has shown</span> a similar dynamic where <span class='card-underline'>the impact of disruptive cyberattacks has been consistently overestimated.</span> ¶ Rather than theorizing about future cyberwars or extrapolating from today's concerns, the history of cyberconflict that have actually been fought, shows that cyber incidents have so far tended to have effects that are either widespread but fleeting or persistent but narrowly focused. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>No attacks</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, so far, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>have been both widespread and persistent.</span></span><span class='card-underline'> There have been no authenticated cases of anyone dying from a cyber attack. Any widespread disruptions</span>, even the 2007 disruption against Estonia, <span class='card-underline'>have been short-lived</span> causing no significant GDP loss. ¶ Moreover, as with conflict in other domains, cyberattacks can take down many targets but keeping them down over time in the face of determined defenses has so far been out of the range of all but the most dangerous adversaries such as Russia and China. Of course, if the United States is in a conflict with those nations, cyber will be the least important of the existential threats policymakers should be worrying about. <span class='card-underline'>Plutonium trumps bytes in a shooting war</span>.¶ This is not all good news. Policymakers have recognized the problems since at least 1998 with little significant progress. Worse, the threats and vulnerabilities are getting steadily more worrying. <span class='card-underline'>Still, experts have been warning of a cyber Pearl Harbor for 20 of the 70 years since the actual Pearl Harbor</span>. ¶ The transfer of U.S. trade secrets through Chinese <span class='card-underline'>cyber espionage could someday accumulate into an existential threat. But it doesn't seem so seem just yet</span>, with only handwaving estimates of annual losses of 0.1 to 0.5 percent to the total U.S. GDP of around $15 trillion.

Thus, one might be inclined to ask whether we are really headed towards a point where a major, society-threatening chain reaction of IT-related events become highly likely or even unavoidable, as some claim (cf. Perrow 1984; Turner and Pidgeon 1997; Tainter 1988; Prothero 2001) – or whether technology rather helps us to evolve towards an increasingly robust society because complex societies are able to overcome crises more easily precisely as a result of their complexity and inbuilt redundancies (Homer- Dixon 2000: 203; LaPorte 1975). Regardless of the viewpoint taken, there seems to be no straight answer to the question of how vulnerable our modern societies really are. In fact, experts widely disagree how likely cyber-doom scenarios are and how serious a threat they constitute. <span class='card-underline'>The </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>majority of official publications are not only very vague about the actual level of threat but also</span></span><span class='card-underline'> more generally have to </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>leave cyberthreats shrouded in a cloud of speculation</span></span> (Dunn 2007a, 2007b).

On 15 April <span class='card-underline'>three dozen</span> or so such <span class='card-underline'>soldiers</span>, many miles removed from reinforcement or logistical support, <span class='card-underline'>pitched their tents</span> in a demonstrative assertion of presence at a barren — albeit sensitive — frontier point <span class='card-underline'>a dozen miles inside</span> what New Delhi considers to be <span class='card-underline'>the Line of Actual Control</span> (LAC) on their disputed border. Alarmist commentary immediately latched on to familiar tropes of Chinese assertiveness, territorial revisionism and the need for President Xi to establish his hard-line credentials, among others.

Activation of the prime ministers-level hotline was not required. By comparison, China’s months-long control of the disputed Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea and its law enforcement assertions in Senkaku territorial waters continue unabated with institutional mechanisms to manage such crises practically non-existent. Frosty bilateral relations make this state of affairs unlikely to be reversed. A code of conduct in the South China Sea and a maritime communication mechanism in the East China Sea will first require that Manila and Tokyo engender an element of political quiet and trust in their respective relationships with Beijing. The origins of the stand-off in the Ladakh Himalayas are in the recent construction of permanent structures by the Indian side at a (separate but) similarly sensitive forward observation point in the disputed western sector — a violation, for the Chinese side, of long-standing border protocols. That the Indian post abuts an arterial road link (Aksai Chin highway) that connects Xinjiang to Tibet prompted Beijing to establish its own skeletal presence barely two-dozen miles removed from the strategic China-India-Pakistan border tri-junction area. With both sides having telegraphed their respective strengths and sensitivities, the PLA presence and the Indian construction activity were thereafter withdrawn. Provocative probes and presence-marking operations that were implicitly directed at undermining China’s control of the strategic Aksai Chin highway, a core strategic interest, at a time when Tibet was in ferment, had been a key precipitating cause of the Sino-Indian war of 1962. Rather than submit to the errors of the past, as some quarters short-sightedly counselled, the Manmohan Singh government displayed exemplary patience and sensitivity in acknowledging the shared nature of the strategic vulnerabilities along the Sino-Indian frontier. That <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>India’s</span></span><span class='card-underline'> boundary </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>policy is framed with</span></span>in a <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>long-standing</span></span> context of <span class='card-underline'>strict </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>bilateralism</span></span> with no scope for third-party interference or instigation — despite the asymmetry in power — was surely a helpful factor too.

The following year, this arrangement was enlarged to include three other European nations (Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands) and became the Brussels Treaty, which includes a commitment to use military force if one of the treaty's parties is attacked. The Brussels Treaty was modified in 1954 to include Germany and Italy and remains in force today. Article 5 of the Brussels Treaty provided the basis for the Washington Treaty's own Article 5, which is less demanding because it does not automatically commit NATO members to military assistance. <span class='card-underline'>Emboldened by their common perception of</span> the Iraq war and <span class='card-underline'>the evolution of U.S. policy, several countries in </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the EU</span></span>, including France and Germany, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>are tempted to deepen their defense cooperation</span></span><span class='card-underline'> independently of</span> the United States and <span class='card-underline'>NATO</span>. Although the degree to which the EU's defense policy should be independent from NATO and the United States is still a point of contention among Europeans and a touchy subject in transatlantic circles, consensus holds that, in the case of a regional crisis, the EU should not be impotent if Washington chose not to intervene. More recently, the EU made the historical decision to include a security clause in its draft constitution that amounts to a mutual security guarantee with the possibility of military assistance. The formulation agreed on by EU governments in December 2003 states: If a Member State is the victim of armed aggression on its territory, the other Member States shall have towards it an obligation of aid and assistance by all the means in their power, in accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. This shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States. Commitments and cooperation in this area shall be consistent with commitments under NATO, which, for those States which are members of it, remains the foundation of their collective defence.n20 <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The EU</span></span> thus <span class='card-underline'>increasingly </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>appears to be a real security alliance</span></span>, and it may in fact be among the most solid ones imaginable, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>given its roots in</span></span><span class='card-underline'> strong </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>economic</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, legal, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>and political integration</span></span>. Thus, in the midst of the decline of other Western, permanent multinational alliances, the EU's emerging common defense policy appears one of the most original and interesting developments in the long history of military alliances. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>If NATO were to decline further</span></span> in importance for Europeans, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the continent would not be left without a security guarantee</span></span>.

James L. Jones said today at the Europe Atlantic Council here. Jones stepped down as NATO's supreme allied commander earlier this month. While some aspects of the alliance may need work, Jones said that, on the whole, it <span class='card-highlight'>is an "</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>incredibly healthy</span></span><span class='card-highlight'> organization</span>."  Jones assumed his office in January 2003 after serving as the commandant of the Marine Corps. During his time in the position, the alliance has changed dramatically. "Perhaps the highlight of the last four years was witnessing the accession of seven new nations into the alliance in 2004," he said. "It was a very emotional moment for seven former Warsaw Pact countries." Membership in NATO meant acceptance in the free world to the former communist countries, Jones said. "There was a sort of palpable enthusiasm for freedom, democracy, rule of law and just the vast potential for those people that had been unleashed," he said. "You feel every day their enthusiasm from these new members." During Jones' tenure, the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan grew from a force providing security in and around the Afghan capital of Kabul, to providing security for the entire country. The NATO commander in Afghanistan now commands 32,000 troops from 32 different countries, Jones said. <span class='card-highlight'>The NATO mission in Afghanistan</span> <span class='card-highlight'>and</span> NATO training mission in <span class='card-highlight'>Iraq</span> are just two operations that <span class='card-highlight'>show the term "out of area operations" is obsolete</span><span class='card-highlight'>,</span> he said. During the Cold War, NATO's job was to defend Western Europe from the menace of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact. There were no "out-of-area operations, nor was the possibility even really contemplated," he said. "It is a given that NATO is operating today on three different continents with more than 50,000 troops committed to NATO missions," he said. Troops under NATO command operate in Asia, Africa and Europe, and Jones said the alliance is also embracing change. "Nowhere was that more in evidence than in establishing the NATO Response Force," he said. The force - 25,000 personnel ready to deploy at a moment's notice - is now fully operational and capable. The general said the force is NATO's greatest commitment to transformation. The force is ready to "take on missions at a strategic distance, but in an expeditionary manner," he said. The NATO Response Force's first real deployment - to Pakistan to help with humanitarian relief following the earthquakes in January 2005 - is a prime example of this, Jones said. The fact that the force's first mission was a humanitarian operation has also caused some reassessment in NATO, he said. "<span class='card-highlight'>NATO is reinventing itself</span><span class='card-highlight'> </span>and re-explaining itself because in this world NATO is thought of, correctly, as principally a warfighting organization," he said. "This transformation of NATO - going from a reactive 20th-century force, which it needed to be, to a 21st-century more expeditionary and agile force - brings with a whole lot of things" that countries didn't realize when they signed up for the process in 2002. "It has caused a lot of pain because it gets you into such things as multinational logistics (and) organic intelligence, which NATO has never had," he said. Other transformational aspects during Jones' command included eliminating duplicate NATO headquarters, disestablishing the Alled Command Atlantic and replacing it with the Allied Command Transformation and placing all operations under Allied Command Europe. This is not to say there are not problems that NATO must address, Jones said. First and foremost is money. The per capita share of many countries has actually gone down since the Prague Summit in 2002. NATO nations agreed during that summit to spend roughly 3 percent of their gross domestic product on defense. Another problem is national caveats, Jones said. This is where troops assigned to a mission has such stringent restrictions placed on them, that commanders can hardly use them. But <span class='card-highlight'>the alliance is </span><span class='card-highlight'>remarkably adaptable and resilient</span>, Jones said. "The other bit of evidence that the alliance is healthy is that I know of <span class='card-highlight'>no countries that are trying to leave the alliance</span>," Jones said. "And I know <span class='card-highlight'>quite a few</span><span class='card-highlight'> </span>that <span class='card-highlight'>are trying to</span><span class='card-highlight'> </span>queue up and measure up to <span class='card-highlight'>become members </span>by as early as 2008."</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Past events prove NATO is resilient</div><div class='cite'>Corn 7 (Tony, Ph.D. – University of Paris and Graduate – U.S. Naval War College, “The Revolution in Transatlantic Affairs”, Real Clear Politics, 8-21, http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/08/the_revolution_in_transatlanti.html)</div><div class='card-body'><p>If <span class='card-highlight'>the Alliance</span> survived a debacle of the magnitude of Suez in 1956, it <span class='card-highlight'>can</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>withstand anything</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. </span>The main danger for NATO therefore is not military failure or even a Suez-like temporary political meltdown, but something more insidious. Over time, what an ill-conceived globalization of NATO could lead to is the transformation of the tactical coalition that the Shanghai Cooperation Organization currently is into a strategic “NATO of the East” while at the same time perverting the Atlantic Alliance into, so to speak, a “SEATO of the West” — namely, a make-believe alliance with no viable strategy (because a conventional military configuration is irrelevant when the threats are of the asymmetric variety) and no coherent policy (because the interests of the global members are simply too heterogeneous to ever converge.) The Long War promises to be a thinking man’s war. <span class='card-highlight'>As a full-fledged Alliance, NATO possesses the kind of</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> </span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>staying power</span></span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> </span></span><span class='card-highlight'>that mere ad hoc coalitions cannot deliver</span>; but NATO still has to come to terms with the fact that thinking power will matter more than fighting power. If NATO is to avoid the twofold danger of the SCO becoming a NATO of the East while NATO becomes a mere SEATO of the West, the Alliance will have first of all to downgrade its “toolbox” dimension and beef up its “think-tank” dimension. </p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>ISIS lost – they’re not a threat</div><div class='cite'>CBS 18, “<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>ISIS beaten</span></span>, U.S. troops reportedly start Iraq drawdown”, https://www.cbsnews.com/news/iraq-us-troops-drawdown-ap-military-declares-isis-beaten-afghanistan/</div><div class='card-body'><p>An Iraqi government spokesman and U.S. contractors in the country told the Associated Press on Monday that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>American forces had begun a drawdown from Iraq following</span></span> Baghdad's <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>declaration of victory over ISIS</span></span> militants.

We achieved victory in difficult circumstances and with God's help, the steadfastness of our people and the bravery of our heroic forces we prevailed." "The flag of Iraq is flying high today over all Iraqi territory and at the farthest point on the border," he added, standing before the most senior members of Iraq's security forces. Following al-Abadi's remarks, his office declared a public holiday Sunday in celebration of the victory, according to an official statement from the prime minister's office. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Iraqi forces mopped up the last pockets of IS fighters</span></span> from Iraq's western deserts Saturday, securing the country's border with Syria, a step that marked the end of combat operations against the extremists.

Oil is an extremely valuable natural resource. However, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>invasion</span></span>, occupation, international, and investment <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>costs reduce the payoffs of seizing foreign resources</span></span>. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Profiting from seized oil is difficult at best</span></span> and impossible at worst. As a result, petroleum <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>prizes are not sufficiently valuable for oil to be a significant contributor to leaders’ decisions</span></span> for international war. Consequently, a territory’s petroleum endowments are a poor predictor of its ability to inspire interstate conflict. These observations have positive implications for contemporary disputes in oil-rich regions like the South China Sea, East China Sea, eastern Mediterranean, and Arctic, as they suggest that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>competition over</span></span> these <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>territories’ oil resources will not lead to intense militarized conflicts</span></span>. However, one might counter this optimistic assessment by arguing that the contemporary contests are not analogous to the historical cases. The greatest difference between them is that, in the current disputes, political authority is ambiguous; multiple countries have legitimate claims to contested territories. Consequently, in these areas, an aggressor would not be seizing “foreign” oil. This distinction would reduce occupation costs, as local resistance would be more restrained.140 Invasion costs would also be lower, since most of the resources at stake in these contests are prospective; there is less oil infrastructure for aggressors and targets to destroy.141 These arguments have some merit. However, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>prospective resources also generate higher investment costs</span></span>, as <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>countries must explore for oil</span></span>, instead of just producing it. The total <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>payoffs</span></span> that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>an aggressor can accrue from prospective resources are </span></span>also<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> very uncertain</span></span>. In addition, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>international costs remain high</span></span>, as the international community condemns the use of force in all territorial disagreements, including those where political authority is ambiguous. Hence, the <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>costs of aggression should still deter contemporary adversaries from fighting for oil</span></span>. This is not to say that current disputes in purportedly oil-rich regions will never escalate. However, if they do, it will be for other, more pressing reasons. The resultant conflicts will not be oil wars.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Oil wars are incredibly rare and won’t escalate</div><div class='cite'>Emily Meierding 16, Ph.D., Assistant Professor of National Security Affairs at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, “Do Countries Fight Over Oil?”, http://b-ok.xyz/book/2805301/b8f1b0</div><div class='card-body'><p>Most previous studies of international, oil-related conflicts have focused on extreme cases: so-called oil wars like World War II or Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait. As a result, they have overestimated the risks posed by oil competi- tion. By adopting a more holistic approach, this chapter has demonstrated that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>major interstate conflicts</span></span>, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>targeting oil fields, are exceptional</span></span>. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Most contests</span></span> for control over oil resources <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>are merely oil spats</span></span>, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>which do not escalate</span></span> into serious conflicts. Contemporary competitions in areas like the Arctic, Caspian Sea, East China Sea, Eastern Mediterranean, and South China Sea have thus far fallen into this category. Although oil-related con- frontations, like the 2014 Sino-Vietnamese rig incident or Turkey’s deploy ment of the Barbaros in 2014–15, occur periodically, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>leaders</span></span> have <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>prevented</span></span> the <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>incidents from intensifying</span></span>. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>They are likely to maintain this restraint</span></span> in the future. As the chapter’s historical analysis demonstrates, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>even rival states</span></span>, with defense guarantees from foreign powers and hostile domestic populations, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>do not intensify</span></span> oil spats. Regional petroleum competition is therefore not a serious threat to international security. Although claimant countries may eventually fight over other issues, such as control over sea lanes, regional hegemony, or national pride, oil competition will not be the trigger for these conflicts. Meanwhile, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>wars for</span></span> survival, targeting <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>oil resources, are currently improbable</span></span>, both because of their historical rarity and because <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>contemporary oil consumers and producers are unlikely to experience</span></span> the three <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>necessary con- ditions for launching major campaigns</span></span> against foreign fields. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Consumers</span></span> like the US, China, and the European Union can <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>rely on international trade</span></span> to meet national import needs <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>without compromising national energy security</span></span>. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Supply shutoffs</span></span>, like the OPEC embargo in 1973–74, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>are unlikely</span></span>, due to a lack of coordination among major producers. They are <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>also unthreatening because of the oil market’s current diversity and flexibility</span></span>. Moreover, even in 1975, in the aftermath of the first energy crisis, American authori- ties concluded that it was not worth the effort to seize Middle Eastern oil fields (Congressional Research Service 1975). Today’s consumers are even less inclined to do so. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Producers will</span></span> also <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>refrain from using intense militarized force</span></span> to increase national oil endowments. This <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>restraint arises as much from a lack of capacity as from a lack of will</span></span>. States like Algeria, Angola, Iraq, Nigeria, and Venezuela have <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>strong incentives to increase national oil reserves and revenue</span></span>, due to their intense dependence on oil rents and their small foreign exchange reserves, which make them highly vulnerable to oil price drops. However, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>they lack promising targets for international aggression</span></span>. Angola and Nigeria’s neighbors are small producers, while Algeria has little to gain from seizing Libya’s disordered petroleum industry. Venezuela has a more appealing target in Colombia, but is weaker than its neighbor, so Caracas is unlikely to launch an attack. Iraq is also constrained, both by Iran’s military strength and by the certainty of a vigorous third-party response to another assault on Kuwait. Thus, today’s producers, as well as consumers, are unlikely aggressors. States may continue to spar for control over oil. However, they will not fight over it.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>No impact to oil price rise</div><div class='cite'>Emily Meierding 14, Ph.D., Assistant Professor of National Security Affairs at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, “Emily Meierding on Resource Wars”, http://www.css.ethz.ch/en/services/digital-library/articles/article.html/185206/pdf</div><div class='card-body'><p>I am going to say no. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>As oil prices rise</span></span>, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>countries have an incentive to develop substitutes</span></span>. Not all countries will be able to do that, at least not all countries will be able to keep pace with the development of substitutes and finding adequate alternative energy resources. But of course we already see that, when many developing countries can’t afford access to as much energy as they would prefer to have. The <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>small developing countries often have difficulty in engaging in very intense militarized conflicts</span></span>, so my guess is that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>more developed countries will still be able to gradually substitute for energy</span></span> at a pace that enables them <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>to avoid outright conflict</span></span>.

Increases in the 1970s and 1980s were caused largely by sharp disruptions to world supply. In contrast, a prime reason for the increases since 2000 has been stronger-than-expected demand from emerging market economies. The <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>strong growth of emerging markets</span></span> has <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>benefited</span></span> both them and <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the global economy</span></span>: raising living standards and increasing their demand for products made abroad. A side-effect of this may have been an increase in oil prices, but this has not derailed the benefits of increased growth. 2. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Central bank policies</span></span> Central banks and economies have <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>become more adept at dealing with price shocks</span></span>. In the 1970s and 1980s, oil price rises triggered fears of inflation, and workers would try to protect themselves by demanding higher nominal wage increases. This had the effect of setting off wage-price spirals. Now, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>greater awareness of the impact</span></span> of high wage increases—including lost employment and reforms to labor markets—<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>have led to more job-friendly wage setting</span></span>. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Central banks have become more adept at convincing workers</span></span> that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>oil price increases will not feed</span></span> through into <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>inflation</span></span>. Today, headline inflation temporarily increases after an oil price increase, but nominal wages hardly respond. Workers have grown to expect this rise in headline inflation, and anticipate that it will be temporary. Given the experience of the past, more recently many oil-importing economies with strong central banks have experienced little impact on core inflation and wage increases, despite oil price rises. This has allowed central banks to be more supportive of promoting recovery in the economy after an oil price increase, rather than having to raise interest rates to dampen inflationary expectations. 3. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Recycling the benefits of oil profits</span></span> The <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>revenues from oil exports are flowing back to oil-importing economies</span></span>. This helps <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>bring down interest rates for households and firms</span></span>, and so supports investment and growth in these economies. 4. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Greater efficiency</span></span> Oil price shocks do not have the same impact as in the past because <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>economies have become more efficient in the use of energy</span></span>. The amount of energy it takes to produce a dollar of income has been steadily declining for 40 years. This decline in energy intensity is expected to continue. Major emerging markets are also becoming <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>more efficient in the use of energy, and they are expected to continue to make efficiency gains</span></span>. By 2030, the major regions of the world—the United States, China, and India—are projected to have the same energy intensity. 5. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Diversification</span></span> <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Countries</span></span> have <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>increasingly diversified their energy sources</span></span> over recent decades. They import energy from many more places than in the 1970s. They also <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>use more varied forms of energy</span></span>. This <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>makes them less vulnerable to disruptions</span></span> from any one supplier or source of energy. The United States, for example, buys crude oil and gasoline from more than 40 countries and jet fuel from more than 25 countries. Countries have also <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>increased their use of natural gas, and are importing it from many more countries</span></span>. Norway has continued to grow in importance as an exporter of natural gas, and several new producers have emerged, including Qatar, Turkmenistan, Nigeria, Egypt, and Australia. By 2030, it is expected that energy use will be even more diversified. Oil, coal, and gas are predicted to each have a 30 percent world market share, with hydro, nuclear and renewables accounting for the remaining 10 percent.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>The US economy is resilient, price spikes wouldn’t cause a recession</div><div class='cite'>Shushanik Papanyan 14, Assistant Professor in the Economics Department at the University of Texas, Arlington, “U.S. Economy’s Resilience to Oil Price Shocks”, https://www.bbvaresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/141126_US_EW_MacroOilEffects.pdf</div><div class='card-body'><p>The <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>post</span></span>-great <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>recession U.S. economy has displayed a decline in producer sensitivity to crude oil price</span></span> while indicating a more sensitive consumer response. There is a qualitative change in the post-great recession oil shock effect, one in which the inflation trend became less interconnected with movements in the crude oil price. The <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>rise of alternative energy sources and the decline of energy intensive production</span></span> as a share of GDP could be likely <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>contributors to the break of the traditional oil price-inflation relationship</span></span>.

However, our initial analysis did not indicate an increased resilience of the U.S. economy to oil price shocks. In the case of a permanent shock to the oil price, we observed a sizable effect on the potential GDP growth, with a negative relationship between oil price change and GDP growth.

This is a complete about-face for old metrics where it was practically automatic for economists to mark down growth when oil prices rose. But the rise of the United States to become the world's second-largest oil producer has changed the calculus for how rising energy prices affect the economy. Consumer pain at the pump is now seen as an offset to an extent by increases in capital spending by U.S. oil companies and by gains in the growing number of regions producing energy. And <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>what once would have been a massive surge in the oil trade deficit</span></span>, which would subtract from gross domestic product, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is now offset to a large degree by U.S. oil exports</span></span>.

The Putin government may have provoked conflict with Georgia, but it did not force the Saakashvili government to fire the first shot. The war looks similar to President George H. W. Bush's invasion of Panama: a dubious venture, but one foolishly invited by an irresponsible local ruler. Even assuming blatant aggression, Georgia, a border state that was once part of Imperial Russia as well as the Soviet Union, is a matter of peculiar geopolitical interest in Moscow.

The idea of water wars</span> (perhaps more than food wars) <span class='card-underline'>is a dominant discourse in the media</span> (see for example Smith, 2009), NGOs (International Alert, 2007) and within international organizations (UNEP, 2007). In 2007, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon declared that ‘water scarcity threatens economic and social gains and is a potent fuel for wars and conflict’ (Lewis, 2007). Of course, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>this</span></span><span class='card-underline'> type of discourse </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>has an instrumental purpose</span></span><span class='card-underline'>; security and conflict are here used for raising water/food as key policy priorities</span> at the international level.¶ <span class='card-underline'>In the Middle East, presidents, prime ministers and foreign </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>ministers</span></span><span class='card-underline'> have also </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>used</span></span><span class='card-underline'> this </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>bellicose rhetoric</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. Boutrous Boutros-Gali said; ‘the next war in the Middle East will be over water, not politics’</span> (Boutros Boutros-Gali in Butts, 1997, p. 65). <span class='card-underline'>The question is not whether the sharing of transboundary water sparks political tension and alarmist declaration, but rather to what extent water has been a principal factor in international conflicts. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The evidence seems</span></span><span class='card-underline'> quite </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>weak</span></span>. Whether by president Sadat in Egypt or King Hussein in Jordan, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>none</span></span><span class='card-underline'> of these declarations </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>have been followed</span></span><span class='card-underline'> up </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>by military action</span></span>.¶ The governance of transboundary water has gained increased attention these last decades. This has a direct impact on the global food system as water allocation agreements determine the amount of water that can used for irrigated agriculture. The likelihood of conflicts over water is an important parameter to consider in assessing the stability, sustainability and resilience of global food systems.¶ <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>None of the</span></span><span class='card-underline'> various and extensive </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>databases on</span></span><span class='card-underline'> the </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>causes of war show water as a c</span></span>asus<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> b</span></span>elli<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>.</span></span> <span class='card-underline'>Using the International Crisis Behavior (ICB) data set and supplementary data from the University of Alabama on water conflicts, Hewitt, Wolf and Hammer found only seven disputes where water seems to have been at least a partial cause for conflict</span> (Wolf, 1998, p. 251). In fact, about 80% of the incidents relating to water were limited purely to governmental rhetoric intended for the electorate (Otchet, 2001, p. 18).¶ <span class='card-underline'>As shown in The Basins At Risk (BAR) water event database, more than two-thirds of over 1800 </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>water</span></span><span class='card-underline'>-related ‘</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>events’ fall on the ‘cooperative’ scale</span></span> (Yoffe et al., 2003). <span class='card-underline'>Indeed, if one takes into account a much longer period, the following figures clearly demonstrate this argument</span>.

Most specialists now tend to agree that the major issue is not scarcity per se but rather the allocation of water resources between the different riparian states (see for example [Allouche, 2005], [Allouche, 2007] and [Rouyer, 2000]). Water rich countries have been involved in a number of disputes with other relatively water rich countries (see for example India/Pakistan or Brazil/Argentina). The perception of each state’s estimated water needs really constitutes the core issue in transboundary water relations. Indeed, whether this scarcity exists or not in reality, perceptions of the amount of available water shapes people’s attitude towards the environment (Ohlsson, 1999). In fact, some water experts have argued that <span class='card-underline'>scarcity drives the process of co-operation among riparians</span> ([Dinar and Dinar, 2005] and [Brochmann and Gleditsch, 2006]).¶ <span class='card-underline'>In terms of international relations, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the threat </span></span><span class='card-underline'>of water wars due to increasing scarcity </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>does not make</span></span><span class='card-underline'> much </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>sense in the light of</span></span><span class='card-underline'> the recent </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>historical record</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. Overall, the water war rationale expects conflict to occur over water, and appears to suggest that violence is a viable means of securing national water supplies, an argument which is highly contestable.</span>¶ The debates over the likely impacts of climate change have again popularised the idea of water wars. The argument runs that climate change will precipitate worsening ecological conditions contributing to resource scarcities, social breakdown, institutional failure, mass migrations and in turn cause greater political instability and conflict ([Brauch, 2002] and [Pervis and Busby, 2004]).

This speciﬁcation was not an obstacle for qualitative analyses of environmental conﬂict, such as those conducted by ENCOP and the Toronto Group. However, it has been a signiﬁcant impediment to quantitative environmental conﬂict and climate change–conﬂict research, due to limitations in data availability. Quantitative environmental conﬂict research emerged from civil war studies. The data sets initially employed in these analyses only recognized conﬂicts as civil wars once they resulted in one thousand battle deaths: an extremely high threshold for environmentally induced contention. The UCDP/PRIO Armed Conﬂict Dataset reduced the fatality threshold to twenty-ﬁve (Gleditsch, Wallensteen, Eriksson, Sollenberg, and Strand 2002). However, it maintained the requirement that the central government be a participant in each conﬂict.

Concern about the shortcomings of the American attempt to strengthen the Iraqi military comes as Iraqi government forces and Shi’ite militias have launched an offensive to retake the city of Falluja from the Islamic State militant group (ISIS). Aid groups fear the campaign could spark a humanitarian catastrophe, as an estimated 50,000 Sunni civilians remain trapped in the besieged town. The <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>continued weakness of regular Iraqi army units and reliance on Shi’ite militias</span></span>, current and former U.S. military officials said, could <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>impede</span></span> Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi’s <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>broader effort to defeat ISIS</span></span> and win the long-term support of Iraqi Sunnis. The sectarian divide between the majority Shi'ite and minority Sunni communities threatens to split the country for good.

That's been portrayed as a sudden collapse of the Iraqi army, but that's not quite right. "<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The Iraqi army has been collapsing for months</span></span> now," Yasser Abbas told me. Abbas, originally from Baghdad, is an analyst at the private research and consulting firm Caerus Associates. Before that, he served as a linguist in for the military in Iraq from 2005 to 2009. "At the end of 2006, I was involved in training the Iraqi national police in Baghdad," he said. "<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The amount of corruption and under-training was [astounding</span></span>] ... <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>insubordination became widespread</span></span>." So, for Abbas, the <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>military's collapse "didn't happen at once. It's been happening for a very long time</span></span>." For instance, the governor of Mosul ordered the military units in the area to go to a particular town, and "the battalion commander said no, it was too dangerous." It's the same insubordination problem the army has had for years. And even when they do fight, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>many units aren't all that effective</span></span>.

"Prime Minister al-Maliki has continuously worked to strengthen his control over the Iraqi army and security forces," the authors of the CSIS report wrote. They said Maliki is using the state's security apparatus for political control and repression. Meyer said the <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>officers' ranks are also often awarded to government cronies</span></span> and have little to with military competence. Another problem is the country's sectarian divide. Many Sunnis feel oppressed by the Shiite majority. The ISIS militants, on the other hand, present themselves as protectors of the Sunni minority against the Shiite-dominated government and its security forces. If ISIS insurgents attack army posts in Sunni neighborhoods, Sunni soldiers leave their positions, take their weapons, and join the extremists. Meyer said the ISIS militants deliberately spread reports of government soldiers being slaughtered by the Islamist group to undermine morale. However, the Mainz-based researcher added that when Sunni extremists attempt to advance through Shiite areas, they also meet with fierce opposition from Shiite militias. These groups have risen up to take the place of the failed army, to prevent the ISIS from conquering Shiite neighborhoods and destroying Shiite shrines. Low morale, low pay <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Widespread corruption</span></span> is another <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>reason the Iraqi army is so weak</span></span>. The CSIS report revealed that <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>even when US advisors were in the country, many soldiers sold military equipment</span></span> in an attempt to supplement their meager salaries. In order to stop ISIS' rapid advance, Maliki has turned to the United States for help. Washington has been providing weapons to support the Iraqi army against the militia since the beginning of 2014. "Now the demand will be that the Americans proceed with air strikes and drones against the ISIS forces," said Meyer. US President Barack Obama has stressed that options to help the government in Baghdad remain open. According to Meyer though, the government in Washington believes Maliki is the main offender and has brought the situation on himself. He said the deliberate discrimination of the Sunni minority is a main cause of the current conflict.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>NGO aid is <span class='card-underline'>useless</span> – it’s <span class='card-underline'>underfunded</span>, <span class='card-underline'>funds are misused</span>, <span class='card-underline'>unequally distributed</span>, and it gives a <span class='card-underline'>false sense of security</span> all while fueling political and cultural conflicts</div><div class='cite'>Amelia Branczik 04, joined Crisis Group in June 2008 and manages the Brussels-based research unit, supporting Crisis Group’s field research and advocacy on policy and thematic issues and producing the monthly CrisisWatch bulletin.

Even more disturbing, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the provision of humanitarian assistance can give non-combatants a mistaken sense of security</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and protection by the international community, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>with tragic consequences.</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Humanitarian aid can prolong and fuel conflicts, </span></span><span class='card-underline'>undermining its ultimate goal of saving lives: For fighting parties, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>aid can become a resource to be fought over</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. Aid leakage, or 'political taxation' of aid, refers to situations in which </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>a portion of the aid goes directly to the fighting parties, who then use it themselves or sell it to buy weapons</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.

Simply ensuring equal distribution to different ethnic groups can reinforce divisions and 'labels' and make the groups less dependent on each other. </span>A commonly cited example of aid perpetuating a conflict is that of Sudan, where civil war has lasted for well over a decade, and over two billion dollars have been spent on humanitarian aid. <span class='card-underline'>Both rebel leaders and aid workers openly acknowledge that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>humanitarian aid</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, in addition to saving many lives, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>is a large factor in making it possible for the belligerent groups to continue fighting.</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Aid can create private incentives for continuation of the war</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, for example by paying relatively high wages to local people employed by aid agencies. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Imported food aid can undermine the local economy</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and make an activity like agriculture less profitable. </span>Solving these problems through aid conditionality carries the risk of harming the poorest and most vulnerable members of society. 'Smart aid' responds to this dilemma by applying the principle of conditionality to aid that is of greatest benefit to warlords and political leaders. Incursions on national sovereignty: Governments may refuse to allow humanitarian agencies to assist their citizens and may object to conditionality of aid and development assistance, citing defense of their national sovereignty. However, there is a growing acceptance of the changing norm of sovereignty to "sovereignty as responsibility," which implies a government's responsibility for the well being of its citizens. 3. Criticisms of Humanitarian Organizations In Cambodia, UNTAC's 1991-93 20,000-person, multi-billion-dollar mission brought high inflation, social dislocation, and a large increase in prostitution and HIV/AIDS cases in Phnom Penh. In Afghanistan, Kabul rents have increased fivefold since the fall of the Taliban. The prices of staples such as rice have doubled, or even tripled, while most salaries have remained the same. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>There is little accountability in the</span></span><span class='card-underline'> humanitarian and </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>development industry</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. There are no barriers to becoming an NGO and no comprehensive or enforceable performance standards for NGOs. Codes of conduct have been developed, such as the Red Cross Code of Conduct (1994), but compliance is voluntary. </span>Because of the high staff turnover in humanitarian organizations and the different nature of conflicts in different countries, it is hard to build institutional memory to improve the efficiency of aid operations and to implement lessons learned. Competition for 'humanitarian market share.' The need to maintain a high profile in order to secure funding can influence NGOs' decision making, they cannot afford not to be seen at a disaster. This situation is aggravated by the impact of uneven media coverage of disasters. The dilemma of neutrality: The 1994 Code of Conduct of the International Federation of the Red Cross explicitly states that NGOs' work must be neutral. However, it is rare for the effects of aid to be neutral even if the provision of it is neutral. Furthermore, it is frustrating to give humanitarian aid to people without being able to protect their human rights. In working with the military, humanitarian agencies, especially NGOs, risk losing the neutrality that gives them their advantage. In addition, being associated with one side can endanger the work and the staff of NGOs. An influx of aid and aid workers can create huge interferences in the local economy. Services such as restaurants, hotels, and brothels tend to spring up as soon as a humanitarian or development operation begins. Houses are built in anticipation of the high rents that foreign aid agencies will pay and prices for commodities and rents inflate. <span class='card-underline'>Lifestyle and budgeting issues: </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>A lot of the money for aid programs</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, particularly with international organizations like the United Nations, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>goes toward staff salaries and technical requirements</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, rather than to the intended recipients of aid. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>This can create tensions</span></span><span class='card-underline'> in relief programs. However, as aid workers often risk their lives in extremely difficult and stressful conditions, this is a difficult issue to resolve. </span>Of two billion dollars spent on the UNTAC mission in Cambodia, most was spent on U.N. staff salaries (an estimated 118.5 million dollars) and travel costs (62 million dollars). Almost 9,000 new vehicles were purchased at a cost of approximately 81 million dollars, and all senior U.N. bureaucrats were given a daily hardship allowance of 145 dollars to supplement their salaries. At the time, the average annual income in Cambodia was 130 dollars. Problems with Development Assistance <span class='card-underline'>Many of </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the challenges listed above for humanitarian aid apply equally to development assistance</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. There are also issues that apply exclusively to development assistance. </span>1.<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> Development assistance is not designed to prevent conflict</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Development assistance can promote conflict</span></span><span class='card-underline'> when it is administered without considering social and political conditions. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>It is very difficult to ensure </span></span><span class='card-underline'>that </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the effects of </span></span><span class='card-underline'>'apolitical' </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>aid are</span></span><span class='card-underline'> politically or ethnically </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>neutral</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Problems arise primarily due to the institutional cultures</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and organizational dynamics of donor agencies, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>which are not geared to dealing with the needs of deeply divided societies</span></span><span class='card-underline'>.</span> Success is often measured in terms of the amount of money disbursed, rather than the outcome of programs. The mandate of these donor agencies is to promote economic growth and development "without regard to political or other non-economic influences or considerations."[5] <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Policies are aimed at improving overall macroeconomic stability</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and economic growth, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>irrespective of potential income-distribution effects</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. However, as James Boyce writes, to concentrate solely on increasing the size of the economic pie, without considering how that pie is divided, is </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>an approach "singularly ill-suited to war-torn societies</span></span><span class='card-underline'>."[6] As all peace settlements are based on a balance of power between warring sides, any measure that disproportionately benefits or hurts one side can make both sides reassess their positions, with potentially catastrophic consequences for the peace.</span> The policies of these lending agencies are based on neoclassical economic ideology and fail to take into account the needs of deeply divided and politically unstable societies. Policies such as liberalization of trade may cause short-term hardships such as increased unemployment, and through their uneven distributive effects can exacerbate cleavages between groups. Cutting government services to reduce budget deficits can weaken the social contract and the ties between citizens and government. Aid administered through government will favor those in power, while channeling aid in a way that bypasses central government can decrease a government's leverage, also causing problems. Lending agencies are gradually reforming to take into account lessons learned, and are forming conflict-prevention and post-conflict reconstruction units, as with the Conflict Prevention and Reconstruction Unit at the World Bank. Increasingly, agencies take into account the potential for conflict when designing their programs and adjust the programs accordingly. There are calls for projects to undergo conflict or ethno-national impact assessments (i.e., analyses of the affect of a proposed action on different ethnic or national groups and/or the conflict itself), in addition to the usual cost-benefit analysis. Another important measure is to involve these agencies more closely in the peace negotiations, as a means of bridging the gap between peace building and economic reconstruction and of improving overall coordination of post-conflict development. Bilateral development assistance also carries problems. Donor governments inevitably have competing multiple interests, only one of which is peace building. During the Cold War, geopolitical concerns were paramount. Economic and commercial interests are at stake, with roughly half of all bilateral aid tied to imports of goods and services from the donor country. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Inadequate funding mechanisms</span></span><span class='card-underline'>: Most donors award funding on a year-by-year basis, making forward planning very difficult for agencies. In general, each year's funding has to be used up before the next year's funding can be obtained, even if that money could be more usefully spent at a later date. In general, </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the international community tends to take a fairly short-term view of post-conflict reconstruction</span></span><span class='card-underline'>, although in reality it takes years for reconciliation or refugee returns to occur. </span>2. Aid Conditionality Although conditionality can be very effective, those enforcing it may face significant difficulties. Donors must coordinate so that they don't undermine each other. Alternative sources of revenue that might weaken donors' leverage, such as recipients' access to natural resources, must be cut off. The potential cost to more vulnerable members of society must be alleviated if necessary, through the use of 'smart sanctions' with humanitarian exemptions. Careful use of carrots and sticks can involve slicing the carrot -- providing aid in installments, to maintain leverage. 3.

Some 60 per cent of Afghan children are stunted due to malnourishment and <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>only 27 per cent have access to safe drinking water</span></span>. “Things may look all right to foreigners but in fact <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>people are dying of starvation</span></span> in Kabul,” Mr Qudus told me. The <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>maladministration and wastefulness of the international aid effort</span></span> in Afghanistan since 2001 <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>are a staple of journalistic commentary</span></span>, to some extent <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>rightly</span></span>. But the average lifespan of Afghans has risen from 45 years in 2001 to 62 today, an improvement due largely to a sharp drop in child mortality. In 2001, one in four Afghan children died before the age of five compared with one in 10 today. The reason for this dramatic progress is improved public health with better vaccination, midwifery and access to health care. Key to this development is $100m from USAID, so often the target of critics, without which the child mortality rate might have stayed where it was. “<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>International aid” brings out the best and worst in people and institutions</span></span>. It may be the occasion for <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>appalling corruption and wastefulness</span></span> or it can make the difference – as in the case of Afghan public health – between life and death for millions. There are aid workers who live a colonial lifestyle and never leave their offices, and others who show extraordinary skills and endurance. In the mid-1990s I came across a hospital in Iraqi Kurdistan, then sealed off from the outside world, which was supplying and fitting artificial limbs to people who had stepped on one of the millions of mines that littered the landscape. Villagers had been trying to make a little money to buy food by defusing mines and selling the explosives and the tin foil in which they were wrapped. Without the NGO-run hospital, few of these legless people would have survived. Likewise in 2001, life in the rebel-held Panjshir Valley was of medieval harshness, but at the bottom of the valley was a state-of-the-art Italian hospital. The picture is very varied. Wartime is not a good moment to start big long-term infrastructure projects. Insurgents know these are politically inspired and intended as a signal that the Afghan or Iraqi governments are doing something for their people. Naturally, they will try to sabotage such projects with mines, assassinations and general intimidation. An outstanding example of this in Afghanistan is the Kajaki hydroelectric dam on the Helmand River, originally completed by USAID as long ago as 1953, but needing a third turbine, ultimately brought in by British troops but never installed. The dam project is today the subject of an angry dispute between USAID, which is funding it, and the US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, John Sopko, who says it has become too expensive to be worthwhile. He says that in 2001 the scheme was expected to cost just $17m but this has since risen to $345m. These figures are vehemently contested by USAID. As Iraq and Afghanistan are two of the most crooked and dysfunctional states in the world, it is unlikely that international aid, along with everything else, will be untainted by corruption and incompetence. It does not have to be like this. Critics of non-governmental organisations and international aid in general will be glad to learn that there is one place in the world where the NGOs have been expelled and local people are running their own project. But the anti-aid lobby may be taken aback by the identity of those running the anti-NGO campaign. They are, in fact, al-Shabaab, the local affiliate of al-Qa’ida in Somalia, who control the Lower Shabelle province, now once again the bread basket of the country. Al-Shabaab has put $2m of its funds into a canal-building project that has brought prosperity to local farmers who no longer depend on the uncertain rains. “<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>We want our people to be free of NGOs and foreign hands</span></span>. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>We want them to depend on each other and to stand free of outsiders</span></span>,” Sheikh Abu Abdullah, the al-Shabaab governor of Lower Shabelle told al-Jazeera. Mohammed Sheikh Abdi, the head of a local farmers’ union, attributes the new prosperity to the NGO ban. “They bought their food from abroad and never bought from us local farmers,” he says. “<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>They killed every incentive to farm. We were hostages to the NGOs</span></span>.” Perhaps the lesson to be drawn from this is that the projects which succeed are modest in scale, easily monitored, produce immediate benefits and where all know that corruption will be inevitably punished.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Squo solves the water crisis—Turkey won’t close the Tigris.</div><div class='cite'>Karadeniz 6/7/18 (Tulay, "<span class='card-underline'>Turkey halts filling Tigris dam after Iraq complains of water</span>...," U.S., https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-turkey/turkey-halts-filling-tigris-dam-after-iraq-complains-of-water-shortages-idUSKCN1J320X, MSCOTT)</div><div class='card-body'><p>ANKARA/BAGHDAD (Reuters) - <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Turkey has temporarily stopped filling a huge dam on the Tigris River after complaints from neighboring Iraq</span></span>, which is suffering water shortages, officials said on Thursday.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>The ME is irrelevant for broader US leadership</div><div class='cite'>Emma Ashford 18, research fellow in defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute in Washington, DC.

The second and third scenarios are also unlikely, but more to the point, neither could be prevented easily by large-scale US military presence. In the case of transit routes, analysts generally agree that while Iran possesses the capacity to impede shipping in the Strait of Hormuz, a small residual force would be sufficient to prevent this.25 In the case of Saudi civil strife, substantial US military presence is more likely to incite domestic unrest among the Kingdom’s religious conservatives than it is to prevent it. History also suggests that substan- tial US forces in the region are largely independent of energy security; the energy shocks of the 1970s were politically motivated, and even during the so-called tanker war the oil supply remained relatively secure throughout the light force posture period of the 1980s.26</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'><span class='card-highlight'>Solving existential risks is the dominant moral priority.</span></div><div class='cite'><span class='card-highlight'>Bostrom 12</span> (Nick, Professor of Philosophy at Oxford, directs Oxford's Future of Humanity Institute and winner of the Gannon Award, Interview with Ross Andersen, correspondent at The Atlantic, 3/6, “We're Underestimating the Risk of Human Extinction”, http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/03/were-underestimating-the-risk-of-human-extinction/253821/)</div><div class='card-body'><p>Bostrom, who directs Oxford's Future of Humanity Institute, has argued over the course of several papers that <span class='card-highlight'>human extinction risks are poorly understood and</span>, worse still, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>severely underestimated by society</span></span>. Some of these existential risks are fairly well known, especially the natural ones. But others are obscure or even exotic. Most worrying to Bostrom is the subset of existential risks that arise from human technology, a subset that he expects to grow in number and potency over the next century.¶ Despite his concerns about the risks posed to humans by technological progress, Bostrom is no luddite. In fact, he is a longtime advocate of transhumanism---the effort to improve the human condition, and even human nature itself, through technological means. In the long run he sees technology as a bridge, a bridge we humans must cross with great care, in order to reach new and better modes of being. In his work, Bostrom uses the tools of philosophy and mathematics, in particular probability theory, to try and determine how we as a species might achieve this safe passage. What follows is my conversation with Bostrom about some of the most interesting and worrying existential risks that humanity might encounter in the decades and centuries to come, and about what we can do to make sure we outlast them.¶ Some have argued that we ought to be directing our resources toward humanity's existing problems, rather than future existential risks, because many of the latter are highly improbable. You have responded by suggesting that <span class='card-underline'>existential risk mitigation may in fact be a </span><span class='card-underline'>dominant moral priority</span><span class='card-underline'> over the alleviation of present suffering</span>. Can you explain why? ¶ Bostrom: Well suppose you have a moral view that counts future people as being worth as much as present people. You might say that fundamentally it doesn't matter whether someone exists at the current time or at some future time, just as many people think that from a fundamental moral point of view, it doesn't matter where somebody is spatially---somebody isn't automatically worth less because you move them to the moon or to Africa or something<span class='card-highlight'>. </span><span class='card-highlight'>A human life is a human life. If you have that moral point of view that future generations matter in proportion to their population numbers, then you get this</span> <span class='card-underline'>very stark implication that existential risk mitigation has a </span><span class='card-underline'>much higher utility</span><span class='card-underline'> than pretty much anything else that you could do. There are</span> <span class='card-highlight'>so many people that could come into existence in the future if humanity survives this critical period of </span><span class='card-highlight'>time---we might live for billions of years, our descendants might colonize billions of solar systems, and there could be billions and billions times more people than exist currently.</span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'> Therefore, even a very small reduction in the probability of realizing this enormous good will tend to outweigh even immense benefits like eliminating poverty or curing</span></span><span class='card-underline'> malaria</span>, which would be tremendous under ordinary standards.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>The aff’s use of the term “domestic violence” is rooted in a heteronormative understanding of relationship violence which excludes the experiences of LGBTQ individuals</div><div class='cite'>Ristock, University of Manitoba Women’s and Gender Studies Program Provost and Vice-President, 2005</div><div class='card-body'><p>[Janice, July 2005, Violence Against Women Online Resources, “Relationship Violence in Lesbian/Gay/ Bisexual/Transgender/Queer [LGBTQ] Communities: Moving Beyond a Gender-Based Framework”, p. 3, http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.208.7282&rep=rep1&type=pdf, accessed 7-13-18, DMH]</p><p>Violence in lgbtq relationships may be referred to as partner violence, relationship violence, or same-sex/same-gender domestic violence. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The term "domestic violence," however, has been most strongly associated with heterosexual relationships and assumes certain gendered roles (male batterers, female victims)</span></span><span class='card-underline'>; therefore </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>it can work against acknowledging violence that occurs in samesex/same-gender relationships.

Hyperinflation has magnified the country’s woes. Meanwhile, the government of Nicolas Maduro has refused to recognize the National Assembly elected in December 2015, in which opposition parties won a supermajority (two-thirds), and has called for the election of a new Constitutional Assembly on July 30, in a bid to revise the constitution, undermine the legislative and judiciary powers, and consolidate his grip on power. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The outlook for the Venezuelan oil industry and the broader economic and political challenges facing the country are intrinsically linked together</span></span>.

There China announced plans to have the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), its flagship economic and development program, invest in Latin America. During the past decade<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>, Chinese policy banks, charged by the government to finance infrastructure and trade, have provided more than $140 billion in loan commitments to Latin America</span></span>.

How does China’s investment approach compare to that of Western lenders? And will China be able to recoup its investments in a region with a history of debt? My research shows that<span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>, unlike the approach taken by Western investors, Chinese lending often takes the form of patient capital</span></span>. By emphasizing nonintervention in sovereign affairs and refraining from imposing conditions like fiscal austerity or transparency, as Western governments do, China promises its financing horizon will not be influenced by such short-term policy targets. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>That helps regions have the flexibility to spend during economic downturns</span></span>. China’s patient capital also tends to align better with debtors’ long-term development goals, allowing countries to incrementally correct policy errors without the threat of abrupt financial destabilization. <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Chinese state-to-state financing packages are clearly aimed at boosting exports and commerce, often featuring guaranteed contracts for Chinese contractors or machinery suppliers.

For example, Trump’s national security strategy claims China is attempting to “challenge American power” by seeking “to pull the region into its orbit through state-led investment and loans</span></span>.” Similarly, a recent National Endowment for Democracy report suggests the China-CELAC forum, which excludes the United States and Canada, is a “convenient policy framework to introduce and promote its soft power agenda.” Are they right, or are they missing some nuances? <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Despite long-standing U.S. concerns about unfair trade competition, China’s approach is clearly built on multilateralism, free trade, and globalization</span></span> — values that previous Republican and Democratic administrations shared. Shoring up regional public goods like infrastructure may end up benefiting U.S. firms, making trade and investment easier. While China may be interested in geopolitical influence, it most certainly also has many commercial objectives in the region, including promoting new export markets, alleviating its domestic overcapacity and helping its companies globalize their operations by gaining cheap assets, market share, and key marketing, distribution, and engineering capabilities. But investing in soft power has had its down sides. It’s true that Latin American governments have flocked to Chinese capital, eager to address long-standing infrastructure deficits. But many Latin Americans have criticized China for its extensive promotion of Chinese firms, labor, and machinery within state-to-state investment contracts, and its lack of local governance standards, including inadequate environment and labor protections. But critics of Chinese investment in Latin Americas have failed to notice an important concern: not its current boom in investment, but a sudden bust. A boom may help the region develop; a bust could lead to another regional debt crisis. So will China lend prudently and foster its promised development, or instead lend too ambitiously and foment a bubble? How will China balance its investment risks? At times China has mispriced investment risk, and the country has lent defensively to absorb its bad investments. For example, China’s extended its loans to Venezuela for more than a decade during periods of volatility — first through the global financial crisis and then through the 2014 commodity downturn. But of course, Venezuela’s situation is deteriorating rather than improving. The country is struggling to repay its outstanding Chinese debts (totaling about $17 billion to $20 billion) amid its historic crisis and dwindling state-oil production. In response, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>China has reportedly loosened the terms on some of Venezuela’s outstanding loans, allowing the country to pay interest only and defer its principle payments, and also the underlying collateral, removing minimum oil shipment quantities and extending repayment deadlines.</span></span><span class='card-underline'> </span>China has enough foreign reserves to absorb such losses, even beyond Latin American borders from Sri Lanka to Indonesia. How can it avoid such moral hazard problems and ensure successful investments in the future? China’s success in reaching its growth targets domestically during its miracle years revealed its ability to prosperously manage local investment projects. Can it also foster good governance internationally? Rather than imposing policy conditions, China increasingly tempers its state-to-state credit risks by diversifying its investments to include market-based instruments. For example, China has created private equity funds (e.g., China-LAC Cooperation Fund, China-Latin America Infrastructure Fund) that are investing in manufacturing, energy, logistics and even technology. It’s also participating in public private partnerships (PPP) and varying its project financing partners to include Chinese commercial banks, multilateral institutions (e.g. World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank) and local development banks. In other words,<span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>China is</span><span class='card-underline'> experimenting with market-based solutions, and moving incrementally in its international economic efforts, much as it did during its domestic development.</span> Its approach to global economic affairs appears to be <span class='card-underline'>more pragmatic than ideological</span> — and may be more<span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>likely to defend</span> than upend the <span class='card-underline'>liberal economic order.</span></p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Brazil will benefit for several reasons from allowing refugees into their country and their president has shown he is willing to implement now.

Over half of</span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>U.S. start-up companies</span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>valued at over $1 billion had at least one immigrant founder.</span><span class='card-underline'> Apple, Google, AT&T, Budweiser, Colgate, eBay, General Electric, IBM and McDonalds all owe their origin to a founder who was an immigrant or the child of an immigrant. </span><span class='card-underline'>The same is true </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>in Brazil</span></span><span class='card-underline'>,</span><span class='card-underline'> where </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>migrants were crucial to economic growth and innovation throughout the 20th century</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. Critics often retort that refugees may import terrorism and generate xenophobia. Again, the U.S. serves as a useful example: It has accepted 3 million refugees since 1975, yet none has been convicted of domestic terrorism. </span><span class='card-underline'>Xenophobia is extremely unlikely to become a serious problem in Brazil.</span><span class='card-underline'> Brazil is, like the U.S., a country built on the backs of hard-working people from Europe, Asia and Africa, and its rich history of recurrent waves of immigration from all over the world have turned it into a culturally and ethnically diverse melting pot that shaped its national identity (even though racism remains a problem). </span><span class='card-underline'>Brazil is home to more than 10 million people of Arabic descent, and many occupy leading positions in business and government – such as Temer himself</span><span class='card-underline'>. In the university course I teach in São Paulo, my students' surnames point to ancestors from Japan, Hungary, Portugal, Italy, Germany, Lebanon, Syria and Spain – a degree of diversity comparable to any major US university. Yet </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>today, Brazil is no longer an immigrant nation: In 1900, 7.3 percent of Brazil's population was made up of immigrants, while today's figure is a paltry 0.3 percent</span></span><span class='card-underline'> and declining. During the military dictatorship, immigrants came to be seen less as an opportunity and more as a national security concern</span><span class='card-underline'>, a notion that still influences the way the national bureaucracy deals with immigrants today. </span><span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>Given how few foreigners now live in the country, Brazil, with a population of 200 million could, in theory, absorb a million foreigners or two without causing a surge of xenophobia – the foreign-born populations would still be remarkably low</span></span><span class='card-underline'>. Second, making a contribution on refugees would significantly boost Brazil's reputation abroad and help partially offset the negative image its current economic and political crisis generates. With governments in Europe and the Middle East desperate to deal with the situation, actively seeking to </span><span class='card-underline'>find ways to bring more refugees to Brazil could help the country in future negotiations with policy makers most affected by the crisis</span><span class='card-underline'> – particularly considering that the rise of populists across Europe, partly in response to the refugee crisis, can be seen as a major threat to stable democracy across the continent. Finally, </span><span class='card-underline'>as the world's seventh-largest economy,</span><span class='card-underline'> </span><span class='card-underline'>Brazil no longer has the luxury to remain passive when it comes to facing the world’s most urgent global challenges.</span><span class='card-underline'> Whenever I make this argument, critics respond that since Brazil did not cause any war, it has no obligation to address its consequences. If applied to other global challenges such as climate change, this logic is dangerously simplistic and shortsighted, and will make meaningful international cooperation impossible. It also overlooks that </span><span class='card-underline'>even accepting 100,000 refugees over the next years would represent a mere 2 percent of Syrians who have fled their country – this would hardly put Brazil at the forefront of this global struggle. Considering the many potential gains at home, there has never been a better moment to step forward.</span></p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='tag'>Brazilian economy remains strong during Venezuelan refugee crisis</div><div class='cite'>OECD 18 [OECD, Brazil- Economic Forecast Summary, May 2018, http://www.oecd.org/eco/outlook/brazil-economic-forecast-summary.htm qc]</div><div class='card-body'><p>BRAZIL <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>The recovery is strengthening and growth will reach 2.8% in 2019.

What were some of the main drivers in play? And are you seeing more opportunities for a rebound in 2018? What are the biggest economic risks to Colombia in 2018? The Colombian economy grew 1.8% in 2017, slightly below the growth figure for 2016, or 2.0%. This digit was close to the one forecasted by the central bank’s technical staff months ago, 1.6%, and to the expectations by the majority of market analysts. The fall in the terms of trade since mid-2014 and the sharp slowdown or even contraction of the country’s main trading partners in the region have been the most important reasons behind the slower growth of the economy in the last few years, including 2017. Additionally, the Colombian economy continued to face some adverse transitory supply shocks. In 2017, the process of adjustment of expenditure continued after the huge negative shock to national income due to the fall of the international price of oil and other commodities exported by the country. While an increase in the terms of trade was reported in the same year, their levels remained significantly lower than those observed before 2014. Similarly, the adjustment of both public and private expenditure has taken place gradually in a less favorable external context. However, there has been a significant advance in this process, as suggested by the reduction of the external imbalance. For 2018, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the external and internal conditions are more favorable than in previous years, which allows to trust in an acceleration of growth. In its most recent projection, the technical staff of the central bank forecasts a growth figure of 2.7%,</span></span> and considers that, within a stable international economic context, it may continue to improve and converge towards potential growth in coming years. On the one hand, the average of international oil prices would increase again compared to the previous year, even after considering any foreseeable correction on its level in the coming months. Additionally, <span class='card-underline'><span class='card-highlight'>the economies of the region begin to show signs of recovery, and advanced economies are at their best moment in the last ten years, which suggests that sectors such as non-traditional exports and services may gain momentum and help consolidate long-term growth. On the domestic front, the decline of inflation and the expansionary monetary policy should help to stimulate demand in the coming month</span></span>s. In addition, investment in civil works announced by the government will continue to contribute significantly to growth, as happened in 2017. However, the possibility of a strong decline of oil prices by an excessive supply that may be deemed to be permanent may require greater and more prolonged adjustments in domestic spending besides those already foreseen. Likewise, the decisions on monetary, fiscal and trade policies that are being made in advanced economies must be considered. Particularly, those related to unforeseen changes in the U.S. Fed’s benchmark interest rate could cause increases in the volatility of financial markets as well as in the risk perception of the economies of the region, increasing the costs of the sources of funding.</p><p>s</p></div></div>
