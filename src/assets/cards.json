The valuation effects of a stronger euro and a stronger ruble against the U.S. dollar further accentuated the growth of remittances in U.S. dollar terms. These effects more than compensated for the dampening of outbound remittance flows from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, in particular Saudi Arabia, due to fiscal tightening and policies discouraging the recruitment of foreign workers. (Greater details are given in the later section, Regional Trends in Migration and Remittance Flows.)","Provisional estimates indicate that ((ul))remittance flows to Europe and Central Asia grew by 20.9 percent in 2017((/ul)) (in U.S. dollar terms), ((ul))after three consecutive years of decline((/ul)). Compared with 2016, in the first three quarters of 2017, the Russian ruble appreciated against the U.S. dollar (from Rub 68 to Rub 58 per dollar). As a result, outbound remittances from Russia (the main source of remittances to Central Asian countries) increased by 5 percent in ruble terms, and 21 percent in U.S. dollar terms (figure 1.2). The inverse relationship between a depreciation of the ruble against the U.S. dollar and the difference between U.S. dollar- and rubledenominated remittances is evident in the quarterly data since 2010.","In 2017, the top remittance receiving countries—in dollar terms—were India, China, the Philippines, Mexico, Nigeria, and Egypt (figure 1.3).

It is worth noting that economic growth in remittance-source countries of the global South (for example, Côte d’Ivoire, India, Malaysia, Russia, South Africa) impacts the flow of remittances, as does the growth of top migrant destinations in the global North.","The current, accelerated pace of global economic growth may continue due to a cyclical recovery in global manufacturing and investment, propelled by trade in goods. This is likely to hold if commodity prices remain steady, and global financial conditions remain supportive despite some tightening in monetary policy (World Bank, 2018a). The growth of advanced economies in 2018 is likely to continue at the same accelerated pace experienced in 2017. Growth picked up in the United States in 2017, helped by the broad-based strength of domestic demand, and the solid advance is expected to continue into 2018. In the euro area, growth picked up as well in 2017 and has remained strong thus far into 2018, supported by robust consumer demand, strengthening investment, and improved flow of bank credit. Russia’s growth recovered in 2017. Growth in the Europe and Central Asia region, as a whole, continues to benefit from betterthan-expected growth in the euro area. Growth in the Middle East and North Africa is likely to advance, thanks to an easing fiscal stance and stronger non-oil sector momentum. Latin America saw a pickup in growth supported by a cyclical recovery in Brazil and improving conditions in Chile, Colombia, and Peru. Developing East Asian countries’ growth is set to moderate in 2018 after accelerating in 2017, supported by robust domestic demand. Robust growth in South Asia mainly reflects strengthening growth in India as the effects of temporary policy driven disruptions (demonetization and a new tax on goods and services) fade. Regional growth in Sub-Saharan Africa is also expected to increase in 2018, reflecting continued recovery in Nigeria and South Africa and steady growth in the rest of the region.","Consistent with this global growth pattern, ((ul))((hl))remittances to LMICs are expected to ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))grow((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) at about ((/ul))((ul))((hl))4((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).1 ((/ul))((ul))((hl))percent in 2018, to $485 billion((/hl))((/ul)) (table 1.1).

An analysis of Turkish, Polish and Mexican Migration as they evolve from Remitters to Savers,” Policy Dialogue, http://policydialogue.org/files/events/Cortina_Ochoa-Reza_More_Migration_Less_Remittances.pdf)//RCU","text":["Introduction","The above quotes illustrate a common assumption regarding the relationship between migration and remittances. Conventional wisdom argues that the relationship between migration and remittances is positive and reinforcing. The basic idea is that as the number of migrants in a host country in period one grows, the level of remittances sent to the home country will increase in period two. Likewise, as the level of remittances received in the home country increases in period two, the level of migration to the host country will increase in period three. These phenomena could be summarized in a nutshell as \"more migration, more remittances\".","Although there is substantial evidence to prove that this dynamic is true, we will argue in this paper that ((ul))the relationship between migration and remittances is not always positive and could be negative((/ul)) depending on demographic, banking and immigration policies that are seldom analyzed comprehensively by scholars or policy makers (some exceptions are Bauer and Sinning 2006, Cobb-Clark and Hildebrand 2002, Amuedo-Dorantes and Pozo 2002).","We will present evidence to show that ((ul))an obvious factor molding the relationship between migration and remittances is the demographic composition of the migratory flow, which could be an unintended byproduct of immigration policies in host ((/ul))((ul))countries. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))A migration flow((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) of children and women, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))following ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))family reunification((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) policies, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))will((/hl))((/ul)) potentially ((ul))((hl))lead to a significant reduction of((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) both the supply and demand of ((/ul))((ul))((hl))remittances((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)). As families reunify((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) in the host country, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))both the original and the new migrant will have fewer relatives to send((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) their ((/ul))((ul))((hl))remittances to((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). This will result in a counterintuitive dynamic: more migration, but fewer remittances.((/ul))","An additional phenomenon is the openness of the banking system to non-citizens (including undocumented aliens) in host countries. This has a conflicting effect on remittances. On the one hand, the level of remittances received in the home country will increase as remitting costs from the host country decreases; this could be the case even if the level of remittances sent remains relatively constant. On the other hand, as the banking system opens up for migrants, it also becomes easier to save in the host country rather than to do so in the home country. This choice, along with family reunification, will transform remitters into savers.","In order to support our arguments we will analyze data from the Turkish and Polish migratory experience in Germany and from the case of Mexican migration to the United States.","The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we briefly discuss why people migrate and remit and we outline our argument. In Section II we present the opposing cases of Polish and Turkish migration to Germany, the former being a clear example of “more migration, more remittances” and the later an example of “more migration, fewer remittances”. In Section III we ask if the Turkish migratory pattern, and the fact that Turkish in Germany have evolved from remitters to savers, could be an effect that is starting to happen to Mexican migrants in the United States already. Finally Section IV explores some policy implications and concludes.","I - Why People Migrate and Remit?","Thousands of pages have been devoted to answer the very simple question: why do people migrate? There is no single satisfactory answer as it is evident to see that people migrate for many different reasons. In fact, the push and pull factors that motivate people to move from one place to another may vary by migratory system, depending on the circumstance people migrate for economic, political, and even environmental reasons. Push factors that prompt individuals to migrate include economic crisis, disparities in income and opportunities, political and religious persecution, natural disasters, and population pressures among others. Some of the factors that pull people out of their countries of origin may include higher wages, better job opportunities, religious and political liberties, better standard of living, etc.","In the literature we find a significant number of theories that study the migratory phenomenon from various perspectives such as neoclassical economics, segmented labor market theory, world systems, social capital, and cumulative causation (see Massey 1999 for a theoretical review). In this paper, however, we center our attention to the New Economics of Labor Migration (NELM) (Stark and Bloom 1985). This theory centers on the individual as unit of analysis. Here researchers are concerned with individual values and future expectations of migrants and potential migrants.","((ul))The particular focus of this theory is on how the migration decision process is made((/ul)). According to NELM ((ul))((hl))migration decisions are not made((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) in a vacuum ((/ul))((ul))((hl))by isolated migrants, but((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) are made ((/ul))((ul))((hl))within families((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) or even communities in order ((/ul))((ul))((hl))to maximize their future income((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) and to minimize their financial risks((/ul)) (Stark and Bloom 1985). The question that arises now is, how does NELM help us understand immigrant remitting behavior? Several studies have concentrated on the remitting behavior of the migrants who send money home (Banerjee 1984, Cortina and de la Garza 2004, Durand et al., 1996, Lucas and Stark 1985, Osaki 2003, Stark and Lucas 1988). ((ul))Immigrants remit for a wide number of reasons that can be encompassed into at least two conceptual perspectives. The first deals with remittances as inter-familial transfers for family maintenance and insurance((/ul)) (Amuedo-Dorantes and Pozo 2002, Durand 1996, Massey 1999, Lucas and Stark 1985). ((ul))These include transfers for basic consumption and asset accumulation. The second considers remittances as particular and/or community-oriented investment in the home country((/ul)) (see Goldring 2004 for a comprehensive discussion).","In this paper we concentrate on the first conceptual category, that is, inter-familial transfers. In light of NELM migration theory, a common denominator that helps explain why immigrants send money home seems to be given by altruistic and non-altruistic reasons, which are sustained by an explicit or implicit contractual agreement between the migrant those family members left behind and sometimes between the migrant and her/his community of origin (Cortina and de la Garza 2004, Dustmann and Mestres 2007, Lucas and Stark 1985, Stark and Lucas 1988). Nonetheless, others have demonstrated that immigrants may also remit for “selfish”","In particular, some studies have argued that ((ul))((hl))the most significant predictors that explain why immigrants remit((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) are((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) two: 1) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))having direct family members((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) and/or children ((/ul))((ul))((hl))living in the home country; and((/hl))((/ul)), 2) ((ul))((hl))having the expectation to ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))return to the home country((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) someday((/hl))((/ul)) (Cortina, de la Garza and Ochoa-Reza 2005, Sana and Massey 2005). Somehow following this literature, others argue that altruism is going to be strongest in cohesive traditional families and weaker in nontraditional families with unstable bonds (Sana and Massey 2005).","In this section we have briefly discussed recent literature that attempts to describe the relationship between migration and remittances. We have argued that once an individual has migrated, he or she has an implicit or explicit contract to send money home to those family members left behind. Within this framework, we would expect that an increase in the number of migrants in period 1 would increase the amount remitted in period 2. This relationship would be reinforced by the number of children and direct family members left behind. In other words, ((ul))as long as new migrants have direct family members and/or children left behind, the overall number of immigrants that will be sending money home will continue to increase.((/ul)) In short: more migration, more remittances.","The question that begs to be answered then is – ((ul))what happens once migrants’ family members are reunited with her/him in the host country?((/ul)) Do immigrants continue to remit? If so, do they remit at the same rate? Some argue that given immigrant’s transnational behavior they will continue to send money back home even if they have settled (Gilick Schiller 1999, Guarnizo 2003). We will argue that the opposite is true. ((ul))((hl))Once family members((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) that had been left behind ((/ul))((ul))((hl))are reunited in the host country, the contract by which migrants and family members((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) left behind ((/ul))((ul))((hl))were obliged becomes obsolete((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))(Sana and Massey 2005). ((ul))((hl))Migrants then will stop remitting to the home country or((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) at least will ((/ul))((ul))((hl))substantially decrease the frequency and amount((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) sent home((/ul)) (Sana 2003 for the Mexican case). This of course does not mean that migrants have reduced its level of income. This means that instead of remitting, immigrants will now increase the level of savings they hold in their host country. They have transformed, indeed, from remitters to savers."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":115}},{"tag":"The scenario is ((ul))Latin American Governance((/ul)).\nWe have three internal links – \nFirst, moral hazard – governments develop a dependency and crowd-out vital social services","cite":"Gautam, 14 – PhD candidate in economics from West Virginia University  (Durga, “Remittances and Governance: Does the Government Free Ride?”, West Virginia University, 9/22/2014, https://business.wvu.edu/files/d/d9873b1d-2cef-41f4-955a-c1cfa70683ce/14-40.pdf, pg. 3-4)//RCU","text":["The substitutability between private and public goods can have important implications.

Barry et al. (2014) also posit –but do not test– that remittances mitigate protest by increasing the opportunity cost of challenging the regime. Indeed, existing evidence indicates that migrant remittances are an important source of income for households in many developing countries, resulting in less poverty (Adams and Page, 2005; World Bank, 2006a; Gupta, Pattillo and Wagh, 2009) and more consumption and investment, including local public goods (World Bank, 2006a,b; Fajnzylber and L´opez, 2007; Chami et al., 2008; Adida and Girod, 2011). Hence, countercyclical remittance inflows (Frankel, 2011) have a compensation and insurance function (Doyle, 2015) that can demobilize citizens during times of economic downturn and declining government spending (Ponticelli and Voth, 2012).","A second argument contends that ((ul))remittances reduce protests via autocratic governments’ policies.

In Honduras, a populist political coalition threatens to unseat the ruling rightist coalition, which is striving to remain in power as long as possible despite the threat of violent unrest.

After all, it has a robust internal security apparatus and there are no meaningful domestic political challengers to the Communist Party. But that state of affairs will likely change once the U.S. trade embargo on the island nation is lifted. ((ul))Despite deteriorating political ties between Havana and Washington, Cuba will continue to press to have the embargo lifted((/ul)) — and despite the prevailing sentiment in the White House, a thawing of relations is likely, at least eventually. ((ul))While Cuba's sitting government is ideologically hostile to Washington, its state-run economic model is unsustainable without assistance from abroad((/ul)). To forestall heavier austerity measures, ((ul))the Cuban administration will attempt a slow economic opening to the outside world. As part of that effort, it will negotiate a lifting of the embargo imposed by its neighbor after the Cuban revolution((/ul)). Among most U.S. politicians and companies, lifting the embargo is a relatively popular proposal, although the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump reinstated stricter limits on the relationship between the countries after a brief thaw under his predecessor.","If it eventually happens, lifting the embargo would provide an economic windfall for Cuba, mainly in the form of greater tourism revenue and related economic growth. ((ul))But a ((/ul))((ul))greater inflow of dollars((/ul))((ul)) into a post-Castro Cuba ((/ul))((ul))is a recipe for greater((/ul))((ul)) political ((/ul))((ul))instability in the long run((/ul)). ((ul))The U.S. private sector would likely see lifting the embargo as a long-term benefit, albeit accompanied by a greater risk of upending the traditional, Communist-enforced political balance((/ul)). While Raul Castro, now 86, would likely have died by the time the embargo is fully lifted, power will rest with a new civilian president whose authority will rest on the approval of the armed forces. ((ul))The system the Castro brothers established over several decades prioritized political stability by giving direct relatives and associates of the president((/ul)), such as Raul Castro's son-in-law, Gen. Luis Alberto Rodriguez Lopez, ((ul))control of key government institutions((/ul)). These include Rodriguez Lopez's control of a tourism conglomerate that administers much of the island's dollar revenue. ((ul))Greater ((/ul))((ul))tourism revenue would create more opportunities for economic growth, which in Cuba's state-run economy would translate into more money and political power for prominent members of the armed forces((/ul)). A lucrative, state-run tourism sector in the hands of few military leaders may turn into a tempting target for other members of the military who feel they are being left out.","Such instability would take years to materialize, however. Raul Castro has likely carefully orchestrated his transition of power — planned for this year — to civilian leader Miguel Diaz Canel. The Castro-era stability will likely persist for years after that power transition. As part of any deal to lift the U.S. embargo, Cuba's government would have to make democratic reforms — strengthening the influence of opposition parties in power. ((ul))Cuba has no sustained history of peaceful political transitions, and so ultimate power rests with whoever can command the most security units.((/ul)) ((ul))Currently, that((/ul))((ul)) command rests firmly with the presidential administration((/ul)), but as economic opportunities spread out, competing poles of power could arise in the Cuban government.

In recent years, high-profile incidents of corruption by the National Party have reduced its support among voters. For the Nov. 25 presidential election, the opposition's addition of popular sportscaster Salvador Nasralla to the ballot helped it closely compete with the National Party — the final margin was less than a percentage point.

This category is called “immediate relatives of U.S. citizens.” For all other relations, however, there are strict limits on the total number in each category. All “immediate relatives” plus all of the family preference categories must fit within an overall ceiling for family-based immigration of 480,000, but this ceiling can be exceeded due to the fact that there is a “floor” of 226,000 for the family preference categories (non-immediate relatives) coupled with the fact that immediate relatives are not capped. (So, when immediate relative immigration is more than 254,000 (480,000 – 226,000), the overall ceiling is “pierced.”) For many years now, there have been no more than 226,000 visas allocated to the family preference categories because immediate relative immigration has been more than 254,000 per year.

At the end of the immigration process, when an immigrant visa is available to the immigrant, there may be an administrative backlog due to the fact that the immigration service may not have sufficient resources to handle its workload.

The filing of that petition establishes a priority date, holding the immigrant’s place in line. The State Department keeps tabs on whether or not there are visas available within the category and per-country limits. If there is no backlog, an immigrant visa (or “green card”) is immediately available to the immigrant, and the immigrant will receive one as soon as the government processes the application. In the application process, checks are performed to make sure the individual has no criminal history, is not a security threat, and is otherwise not inadmissible as an immigrant to the U.S.","In recent years, however, ((ul))the number of visas available in our family immigration system has not met the demand. Except for the spouses, children, and parents of U.S. citizens, for which there are no per-country or category ceilings, there are backlogs in all categories of family-based immigration((/ul))[2]. Each month, the State Department publishes a table showing the availability of immigrant visas relative to their priority dates. The “Visa Bulletin,” in which this table is published, can be found on the Web site of the State Department at:","http://www.travel.state.gov/visa/bulletin/bulletin_1360.html.","As of November 2011 (according to the most recent State Department report on the number of persons waiting for an immigrant visa), there were more than 300,000 wives, husbands and children of legal permanent residents waiting for immigrant visas[3]. By August 2012, these immigrants were only now receiving a visa if their priority date was earlier than March 15, 2010—that is, after a wait of almost two and a half years.

For reasons having to do with the ability of the government to keep up with the demand for “adjustment of status” cases, the “current” priority date may actually go backwards from one month to the next. For example, in January 2011 the priority date for which visas were being allocated for the category of siblings of U.S. citizens was January 1, 2002. By February 2011, the priority date had actually receded to January 1, 2000.","Given that we have already decided, in the structure of our immigration law, to make family unity a priority, ((ul))it does not make sense to have an outdated quota system that keeps families separated for many years.((/ul)) If we as a nation continue to believe that it is important to keep families together, then ((ul))((hl))we must reform our immigration system so that the category and per-country limits((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) that we now have on family-based immigration ((/ul))((ul))((hl))meet our needs((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul))","Current law regarding family unification should be updated","The emphasis we place in our immigration law on the reunification of families makes sense in terms of helping our newcomers adapt to their new home. Family members help each other adjust to their new surroundings by pooling resources and sharing responsibilities (for example, for the care of children or elderly parents).","The inability to bring family members makes it harder for U.S. companies to attract the workers they need. Workers who do come may be less productive if forced to endure a long separation from their families. Additionally, immigrants coming to the U.S. as a result of family ties also get jobs and become valuable contributors to our economy. Finally, strong families help stabilize communities.","As the backlogs grow, more families are facing the choice of remaining separated for several years or keeping the family intact by having some members enter illegally. The backlogs are also yielding consequences contrary to some of our other policy goals. For Filipinos, for example, becoming a U.S. citizen may mean a longer separation from adult children. The backlog for the adult children of Filipinos who become citizens is longer than the wait to bring in adult unmarried children of permanent residents. As a practical matter, reuniting with family in this case may mean postponing citizenship.","Immigration reform is needed to speed the reunification of families","Changes to the family preference system are needed so that families might be re-united in a timelier manner. Updating our family immigration laws will reduce the pressure for family members to migrate outside of legal channels. By creating wider legal channels for immigrants to come here, the number of people who come illegally will be reduced or eliminated.","((ul))There are a number of things Congress could do to alleviate the backlogs((/ul)) and their consequences.","Update the immigrant quota system: Our immigrant quota system has not been updated in more than two decades, despite increased demand.

The definition of immediate relative might be expanded to include the spouses and minor children of legal permanent residents. This would free up visas in the limited family preference system so they could be re-allocated to the remaining categories of family-sponsored immigrants. With these extra visas, there would be much progress in reducing the long backlog now experienced by these categories of immigrants.","Place a cap on the backlog: Congress could provide for waivers to the per-country and world-wide numerical limits to family reunification that would be triggered when an immigrant’s wait exceeded a period of time—five years, for example. Any eligible family-sponsored immigrant who had waited five years or more would be given a visa whether or not that year’s quotas had been reached.","Re-allocate unused visas from the prior year: Even though there is more demand for visas than there are available visas, it sometimes happens (usually, because of processing delays or security screening) that some of the visas that should be allocated in a given year are not allocated.

Broadening the Scope of “Family”","When a government chooses to adopt a strong family reunification policy, it must follow through by recognizing that “family” cannot be limited to a statute’s narrow view of who is and who is not “family,” when society itself reflects different models than those embodied in the statute. “Relations between immediate family members—spouses or parents and children, ‘legitimate’ or ‘illegitimate’—constitute family life with little need for extensive inquiry.”100 However, stopping at this point fails to fulfill the United States’ policy goal for family unity.

The North American Family Model Versus Other Cultural Family Models ","The SNAF image may be more prevalent in movies, television shows, magazines, and books, but this does not make it the only family model in the U.S. Many movies and television shows depict fathers who work, mothers who cook and clean (she may have a job, but her dominant role is caretaker), and children who are all in school.103 “Scholars concerned about the impact of such images point to those who blame family structures that deviate from th[e] norm for many of society’s problems and who suggest policies that ignore or punish families that don’t fit the construct.”104 ((ul))The cultural values of these “deviant” types of families are considered abnormal to the SNAF. In reality though, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))other family models exist all over the world and throughout the United States((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul))","Single person and two-person households have come to play an ever more important role, as have other models—grandparent-grandchild households, for example—in which others, relatives and non-relatives, live in the household, either in addition to or instead of the expected nuclear family members . . . . Despite its diminished reality, immigration law is based on the assumptions of the dominant model.105","The question remains, though, if family dynamics are changing in the United States, why do immigration laws continue to preference the SNAF model of family?","((ul))((hl))In most of the different ethnic groups immigrating((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) to the United States, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))family structures are multigenerational((/hl))((/ul)).106 Growing up in the Asian culture, I myself have experienced a multigenerational family with cousins and grandparents living under the same roof. For most of my life in the United States, my paternal grandfather was a primary caregiver. My cousins in Taiwan lived with our maternal grandparents, two sets of aunts and uncles, and all of their children. Each family member contributed to the well-being—both financially and emotionally—of the entire family.","((ul))Many Latin American communities are known for viewing entire villages as helping to raise the children of all((/ul)).107 “[T]he most significant characteristic of the Chicano family has been identified as familism . . . .”108 Researchers have found that Mexican-Americans, when compared to Anglo-Americans, are more likely to rely on relatives for emotional support.109","In ethnographic studies of African-American families, researchers have found relations that exist “between fictive kin (non-blood kin who relationally define themselves as family) are as strong and lasting as those established by blood,”110 and provide support and mutual aid in an extended family.","None of these models are “better” than the North American model, but the are different. Even so, ((ul))U.S. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))immigration law seems to prefer the North American Model, which defines family((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), perhaps, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))even more narrowly than the actual,((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) average North American ((/ul))((ul))((hl))family((/hl))((/ul)).111","A question to ask ourselves is why we seem to hold immigrants seeking admission into the United States to a narrowly standard of “family” than we do our own native families already living the U.S.? If our own American society cannot reflect the ideals of our laws, how can we expect others to conform to our idealized standards? For example, the United States may deny admission to a foreign national with a criminal history.112 However, a United States citizen with a criminal history who goes on vacation will be admitted back to the United States.113 One possible explanation is the desire to limit admissions to people who we think will add to the quality of our society and to not admit those people who will add to or exacerbate our society’s problems. We, as members of our society, can decide who we want to include.114 While this idea may be applicable when immigration laws exclude criminals,115 prostitutes,116 and people with communicable diseases,117 it loses applicability when applied to family models. ((ul))((hl))The function of family is subjective and unique((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) to each family unit. It is clear that “[t]he idea of what constitutes a family and its positive characteristics needs to be expanded.”((/ul))118 Although advocating that each family be allowed to define themselves for immigration purposes would be ideal, this solution would lead to an unworkable rule. Instead, the United States should broaden its family categories so that they are broader and more flexible, similar to Canada’s immigration laws.","2. A Broader Definition of “Family”: Canada’s Example","((ul))((hl))The United States should adopt an immigration model that is similar to Canada’s((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) model.((/ul)) Like the United States, Canada has a policy for family reunification. However, unlike the U.S., Canada’s policy is more effectively carried out in its immigration statutes. Canada’s Immigration and Refugee Protection Act of 2001 119 expanded the definition of “family” to include family members that are not presently included under U.S. immigration law. ((ul))((hl))The first ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))apparent((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))difference is the inclusion of((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) a “common-law partner or conjugal partner.”120 This allows ((/ul))((ul))((hl))same-sex partners to enter((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) Canada ((/ul))((ul))((hl))as a member of the family((/hl))((/ul)). Under the INA, the U.S. doesn’t acknowledge same-sex partners as “family,” even if the country of origin acknowledges the two as a married couple. In order to adopt a policy similar to Canada’s policy, the U.S. does not need to recognize the same-sex marriage, but merely that same-sex partners have family bonds that should be protected under United States’ immigration laws.","((ul))Canada also allows((/ul)) “the mother or father of the sponsor’s mother or father” to enter as a member of the family.121 Therefore, ((ul))((hl))a((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) petitioning ((/ul))((ul))citizen((/ul))((ul)) or ((/ul))((ul))((hl))legal permanent resident would be able to bring their grandparent((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))to Canada. The inability to bring in one’s grandparent to the United States under existing family preference categories, is a source of major frustration for many immigrants, especially if they come from a culture where families are multigenerational and grandparents are considered part of the “nuclear” family.122 If the U.S. is to effectuate its policy for family reunification, then Congress should amend the “immediate relative” category to include grandparents. Hence, when birthright U.S. citizens, naturalized citizens, or legal permanent residents reach the age of twenty-one123 they would be able to petition for the admission of their grandparents. This chance would solve some of the mixed-status family’s problems.124","For some U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents, ((ul))((hl))another source of frustration is not being able to sponsor relatives((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) whom ((/ul))((ul))((hl))they have raised as their own children, but((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))are not((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) necessarily ((/ul))((ul))((hl))their biological children((/hl))((/ul)).125 However, ((ul))Canada has recognized that these types of relationships must be included within the definition of “family,” and are necessary if family reunification is to be more than just an aspirational goal. ((/ul))If an orphan is under the age of eighteen and is unmarried, Canada will allow him or her to enter as long as the child is “a child of the sponsor’s mother or father” (a brother or sister), “a child of a child of the sponsor’s mother or father” (a nephew or niece), or “a child of the sponsor’s child” (a grandchild).126 The United States should adopt these provisions.","Canada’s broadest expansion of “family” is the inclusion of any relative, regardless of age, as a member of the “family class.” If the petitioner does not have any family members that fall within the aforementioned family categories, the petitioner is allowed to bring in any relative.127 Canada recognizes that despite the fact that someone may have no blood relatives, he or she may still have family-like relations that are worthy of protection by the country’s immigration laws. This final category provides a necessary element of flexibility to encompass different notions of “family.”","3. Broadening the Scope of “Family” and its Effects on Mixed-Status Families","((ul))((hl))The definition of “family” cannot remain static because the status quo has led to problems with((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) family ((/ul))((ul))((hl))reunification and((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) created ((/ul))((ul))((hl))mixed-status families((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) As discussed above, undocumented immigrants often desire to legitimize their presence, but because of the possibility of family separation, they tend to avoid drawing attention to themselves. Many of the problems facing mixed-status families would be solved if they could have entered legally in the first place. Assuming arguendo that a majority of people seeking entry have some familial contact to the United States, they would have more opportunities to seek sponsorship among those already in the United States. After receiving permission to enter, their families would then be derivative beneficiaries. The United States could even provide a threshold standard in order to take advantage of the family petitions. For example, Canada has considered a standard requiring the sponsored individual to be “known and emotionally important to” the sponsor.128 ((ul))((hl))If the “known and emotionally important” standard is adopted((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) in the United States, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Congress could create factors((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) for an immigration officer to use, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))such as actual familial kinship((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) relationship, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))length of acquaintance((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), ((/ul))((ul))((hl))length of shared residence, geographical distance((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) between residences, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))knowledge of((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) each other’s ((/ul))((ul))((hl))personal histories,((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) number of ((/ul))((ul))((hl))shared experiences, and strength of bond((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), which would aid in a flexible application of derivative beneficiary status.((/ul))","Critics of expanding the scope of “family” may argue that the Department of Homeland Security—more specifically the INS—is already overwhelmed by the number of entrants, pointing to the log jam in the priority dates. They may claim that an expansion of those who may qualify as “family” will burden an already overburdened agency and that examining each applicant’s relationship would be too cumbersome and difficult. Consider, however, that the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) recently received a nearly 4.8% budget increase under President Bush’s Fiscal Year 2006 budget.129 This equals a $6.7 billion total budget. If people are given more legal avenues to enter the United States, fewer people will attempt crossing the borders illegally. The money saved could then be diverted to deal with a heavier volume of family applications. Not only are there enough resources to administer this broader definition of “family,”","[C]ountries find it to their advantage to admit close family members of migrants. Often they are able to facilitate the integration process and to enable the migrant to establish him- or herself more quickly . . . . The presence of family members also reduces remittance abroad—a useful benefit for the receiving countries since the immigrants will spend the money on consumption or investment in their new home country.130","When all factors are considered, a broader scope of “family” seems to be a win-win situation."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":191}},{"tag":"Strict definitions of family in immigration law undermine effective kinship networks","cite":"Gubernskaya and Dreby, 17 – Gubernskaya is an Assistant Professor of Sociology at the University at Albany-SUNY; Dreby is an Assistant Professor of Sociology at the University at Albany-SUNY (Zoya and Joanna, 2017, \"US Immigration Policy and the Case for Family Unity,\" Journal on Migration and Human Security, Volume 5, Number 2)//RCU","text":["Although ((ul))((hl))the current((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) US immigration ((/ul))((ul))((hl))policy((/hl))((/ul)) includes a relatively large list of relatives, it ((ul))((hl))emphasizes legal definitions of family and assumes that formal((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), close kinship ((/ul))((ul))((hl))ties are the most instrumental((/hl))((/ul)).

Embedded technology improves the productivity of workers, which increases capital accumulation by slowing down the diminishing returns to capital. Diminishing returns happen when a worker is given more than, say, one computer; that worker won’t produce as much with the second computer as compared with the first one unless he has the programming skills to run an algorithm that allows computing to be done without the worker using it all the time. ","If the digital age is to increase productivity and lead to a stronger phase of economic growth, it will require investment in not just R&D, but also peoples’ skills and firms’ practices to embed those technologies into how businesses operate. An example is law firms that are starting to use AI to conduct some aspects of due diligence, which frees up the time of junior associates to undertake other legal work.","((ul))Although the Solow paradox is still with us, there are signs that technology is becoming better embedded, such as artificial intelligence that ((/ul))((ul))can do((/ul))((ul)) computing without a constant human presence.((/ul)) But to ensure that happens requires investment in more nuanced ways — notably in how to embed tech into the workplace.

","Immigrants are not only younger than their native-born counterparts but also more inclined to participate in the labor force. The latter is especially true of immigrant men.

The OADR fluctuated within the range of 19 to 24 up until 2010, but with baby boomers now retiring in large numbers, the ratio is expected to climb above 40 by 2030 and reach 47.5 by 2065. If legal immigration were sharply curtailed, as has been proposed, the future OADR would rise even higher. If immigration were cut off immediately, the ratio would reach 55.9 by 2065.9 ","The smaller the future Old Age Dependency Ratio, the less strain there will be on federal retirement programs.

((ul))Because immigrants are more likely to be of working age than native-born Americans and are more likely to seek work, immigration can help to slow or even reverse the recent trend of declining labor force participation.((/ul)) ","((ul))((hl))An increase in the workforce driven by immigration does not lead to a gen((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))eral displacement of existing native-born workers((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) ((ul))Although the US labor force has more than doubled in the past 50 years, there has been no upward trend in the unemployment rate because the economic activity enabled by the growth in workers has also stimulated demand for workers.((/ul))10 ((ul))As the workforce grows, so too does demand for all the goods and services that American households pur((/ul))((ul))chase, from groceries and cars to education and housing.

Because ((ul))immi((/ul))((ul))grants tend to have different skills than the typical native, they boost the growth of the US economy by filling niches in the labor market. Immigrants tend to be overrepresented at the higher and lower ends of the skill spectrum, while native-born Americans tend to be clustered in the middle skill levels. Immigrants make up 17 percent of the US workforce, but they account for more than one-third of workers in the United States with a PhD in((/ul)) the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math (((ul))STEM((/ul))). On the other end of the skills spectrum, immigrants represent 40 percent of those in the workforce without a high school diploma.12 ","((ul))The complementary nature of immigration means that immigrants do not compete directly with ((/ul))((ul))the vast majority of((/ul))((ul)) Americans for employment.((/ul)) In fact, ((ul))((hl))by providing skills that are in relatively short supply, immigrants enable US workers to be more productive((/hl))((/ul)). ((ul))In the technology area, immigrants make up a disproportionate share of scientists, college professors, and technical work((/ul))((ul))ers. Native-born Americans are not earning qualifying degrees in numbers suf((/ul))((ul))ficient to fill the available positions in US industry.((/ul)) By filling those positions, high-skilled immigrants add to the “agglomeration effect” by creating a critical mass of workers in a particular region and industry where ideas can be shared more easily.13 Silicon Valley is the most notable example. ","((ul))Because of differences in English proficiency, immigrants tend to concen((/ul))((ul))trate in more technical occupations such as the job of computer specialist. This creates more opportunities for native-born workers, who are more concentrated among managers, sales personnel, and other occupations requiring more interac((/ul))((ul))tion with customers and subordinates.((/ul))14 ","On the lower rungs of the skills ladder, immigrants fill jobs that fewer and fewer Americans are interested in, and they fill those positions at wage rates that allow their industries to remain competitive in the US market. Such jobs require only short-term, on-the-job training and include health service workers, personal service workers, farm laborers, cleaning service and food service workers, construction workers, textile machine operators, carpenters, and nonfarm laborers.15 Low-skilled immigrants also fill positions in the growing health and home care service sectors, such as home health aides, nursing aides, orderlies, attendants, personal and home care aides, medical assistants, and maids and housekeepers.16 ","Such jobs were filled in decades past by adult Americans without a high school diploma, but the number of native-born Americans in that category has been steadily shrinking. From 2000 to 2016, the number of native-born Americans 25 and older who had not completed high school fell by almost 7 million, from 20.5 million to 13.5 million. As a share of the adult native-born population, the share of high school dropouts has declined in that same period from 13.4 percent to 7.6 percent, and the share continues to decline.17 ","Contrary to popular belief, a large majority of native-born workers do not compete for jobs with low-skilled immigrants. Studies show that immigration may have a modest negative effect on wages earned by the small and shrinking pool of adult Americans without a high school diploma,18 but the impact on the wages of the other 92 percent of native-born Americans in the labor force is neutral to positive. ((ul))On the high-skilled end of the spectrum, the impact of immi((/ul))((ul))gration on the wages of the native born is muted by the complementary nature of the immigrants’ skills.((/ul)) Matthew J. ((ul))Slaughter, a former member of the president’s Council of Economic Advisers, noted((/ul)) in a survey of immigration and productivity growth, ((ul))“((/ul))((ul))((hl))Skilled immigrants tend to complement, not substitute for, native((/hl))((/ul))((ul))-born ((/ul))((ul))((hl))workers in US companies((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). Companies that hire more skilled immigrants tend to hire more native-born workers as well.”((/ul))19 ","((ul))A rising share of immigrants in the labor market also encourages Ameri((/ul))((ul))cans to upgrade their skills with more education and to shift into areas of employment where language skills are more important and tend to be rewarded. As immigrants enter the workforce, Americans tend to stay in school longer to upgrade their skills and their potential earning power.((/ul)) A 2012 study found that an increase in the presence of immigrants in the workforce increased the probability that native-born Americans will stay in school and complete their high school education.20 Other research suggests that in states with a heavier concentration of less educated immigrants, native-born workers are more likely to shift to more communication-intensive occupations, where their language skills give them an advantage and where wages are typically higher than in manual jobs. This has the collective effect of raising the productivity of Americans in the workforce.21","Lower-skilled immigrants also boost productivity and output by supplying services that allow higher-skilled Americans to raise their productivity. The 2016 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) noted that low-skilled immigrants reduce the price US households pay for immigrant-intensive services such as childcare, eating out, house cleaning and repair, landscaping and gardening, taxi rides, and construction. The affordability of such services allows native-born workers in higher-salaried jobs, especially women, to increase their paid work hours.22","((ul))((hl))Immigrants promote faster US economic growth because they are generally more flexible about when and where they will work.((/hl))((/ul)) Immigrants have proven to be more geographically mobile. They are less likely to be rooted in one geographic location and are therefore more willing than natives to move to places where demand for their labor is higher than the supply.23 That can mean moving to urban centers of high-tech activity or to rural areas in need of specific kinds of labor, from agriculture to healthcare. They are also more willing to work unusual hours, at nights and on weekends, which provides more labor for the economy in a way that is less likely to compete directly with US-born workers.24 ((ul))Greater mobility serves the overall economy by reducing regional differences in employment and by allowing work to be spread out across time and space.((/ul))","In summary, immigrants do not ordinarily compete with Americans for a limited number of jobs; instead, they work with and for native-born workers in a cooperative way that lifts the general productivity and prosperity of the United States.","Immigrants Spur Innovation, Patents, and Startups","Immigrants create wealth in America by spurring innovation and founding new companies. ((ul))Highly skilled immigrants are more likely to file patent applications than their native-born counterparts and are more likely to start new businesses, fueling entrepreneurial activity, providing new products and services, and creating employment opportunities for native-born workers, while raising overall productivity.((/ul)) ((ul))The patenting and innovation spurred by immigrants allow the((/ul)) ((ul))U((/ul))nited ((ul))S((/ul))tates ((ul))to shift beyond its production possibility frontier, which raises the speed limit for the economy’s long-run growth potential.((/ul))","The 2016 NASEM report found that “immigrants are more innovative than natives; more specifically, ((ul))high-skilled immigrants raise patenting per capita, which is likely to boost productivity and per capita economic growth.”((/ul)) While immigrants account for 13 percent of the US population, they are responsible for one-third of all patent filings in the United States.25","The United States has been the world’s greatest beneficiary so far from the international mobility of skilled labor. The United States has attracted the largest net inflow of global inventors who have filed international patents. Based on data from the World Intellectual Property Organization from 2001 to 2010, a recent study determined that “the United States has received an enormous net surplus of inventors from abroad, while China and India have been major source countries.”26 Again, the prime example is Silicon Valley in California. The same study found that “more than half of the high-skilled technology workers and entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley are foreign-born.”27","((ul))Immigrants are also more likely to found new enterprises, from ethnic restaurants to billion-dollar technology companies.((/ul))28 Some of the most famous and successful US companies today were founded or cofounded by first- or second- generation immigrants. ((ul))According to a June 2017 report from the Massachusetts Technology Leadership Council, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))40 percent of America’s Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or the children of immigrants((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). A 2016 study by the National Foundation for American Policy found that more than half of the startup companies in the((/ul)) ((ul))U((/ul))nited ((ul))S((/ul))tates ((ul))today that are valued at more than $1 billion, so-called “unicorns,” were started by immigrants.((/ul)) The 44 unicorn companies founded by immigrants each employed an average of 760 workers.29","As one study of global talent flows concluded, “The weight of the evidence points to high-skilled immigrants boosting innovation and productivity—mainly through increased quantity of skilled individuals pursuing innovative work.”30","“Immigration Surplus” Raises Income of Americans","((ul))Immigrants fuel economic growth, wealth creation, and higher average incomes in the countries where they settle.((/ul)) The primary beneficiaries are the immigrants themselves, but native-born individuals are also net beneficiaries. ((ul))The economies of scale of a larger domestic economy, the economic diversity and complementarities, and the ideas, innovation, and entrepreneurship that immigrants bring create a net gain in wealth for their native counterparts.((/ul))","((ul))Economists call this the “immigration surplus.” It is the net gain available to natives when the economic costs from immigration are subtracted from the benefits.((/ul)) The number is typically small compared to America’s huge economy, but while estimates vary, they are invariably positive. Under conventional assumptions, the annual immigration surplus from the current stock of US immigrants is estimated to be in the range of 0.1 to 0.4 percent of US gross domestic product.31 That translates into $19 billion to $74 billion in today’s economy in the total net benefits accrued to native-born Americans from current levels of immigration.","In a comprehensive 2016 study of the economic impact of immigration on the economies of wealthier nations such as the United States, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded, “Immigration significantly increases GDP per capita in advanced economies.” Specifically, ((ul))the IMF study estimated that a one-percentage- point increase in the share of migrants in the adult population can ((/ul))((ul))raise GDP per capita by up to 2 percent((/ul))((ul)) in the long run, mainly through increased labor productivity.((/ul))32","((ul))The IMF study((/ul)) found that immigration had no measurable impact on income distribution in advanced economies. It ((ul))found that high-skilled immigration did have a larger benefit for the top 10 percent of earners, but the bottom 90 percent also benefited((/ul)). Low- and medium-skilled immigration “equally increases income per capita for the bottom 90 percent and the top 10 percent.”33","Immigration also exerts a positive influence on US government finances. In general, ((ul))immigrants tend to produce a fiscal surplus for the federal government, especially for its retirement programs, while imposing more immediate net costs on state and local governments, in particular because of education and ((/ul))((ul))incomesupport((/ul))((ul)) programs.((/ul)) ((ul))High-skilled immigrants produce large fiscal surpluses for the government((/ul)), while low-skilled immigrants tend to have a negative impact.","The NASEM report concluded that an immigrant who arrives in the United States at age 25 with a four-year college education will, over his or her lifetime, contribute a net surplus of $504,000 to the finances of governments at all levels (net present value, 2012 dollars). An immigrant with an advanced degree will contribute almost twice that net amount, $972,000, in his or her lifetime. An immigrant with less than a high school education, in contrast, will impose a net cost of $109,000 over his or her lifetime.34 The IMF study notes that such direct, static analysis may underestimate the full fiscal impact of immigration. A more “dynamic scoring” approach would take into account the spillover impact of immigration on productivity and GDP growth for the entire economy, an effect that further boosts tax revenue.35","In its landmark 2016 study of the economic and fiscal consequences of immigration, ((ul))NASEM concluded that immigration unambiguously contributes to US economic growth:((/ul))","Most obviously, ((ul))immigration supplies workers, which increases GDP and has helped the((/ul)) ((ul))U((/ul))nited ((ul))S((/ul))tates ((ul))avoid the fate of stagnant economies created by purely demographic forces—in particular, an aging((/ul)) (and, in the case of Japan, a shrinking) ((ul))workforce((/ul)).

((ul))At present they are accelerating toward 400 ppm, and by 2050 they will reach 500 ppm, about double pre-industrial levels. Unfortunately, atmospheric CO2 lasts about a century, so there is no way immediately to reduce levels, only to slow their increase, we are thus in for significant global warming; the only debate is how much and how ((/ul))((ul))serous((/ul))((ul)) the effects will be.

Economist William Cline once estimated the damage to the United States alone from moderate levels of warming at 1-6 percent of GDP annually; severe warming could cost 13-26 percent of GDP. ((ul))But the most frightening scenario is runaway greenhouse warming, based on positive feedback from the buildup of water vapor in the atmosphere that is both caused by and causes hotter surface temperatures.((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))Past ice age transitions, associated with only 5-10 degree changes in average global temperatures, took place in just decades, even though no one was then pouring ever-increasing amounts of carbon into the atmosphere.((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))Faced with this specter, the best one can conclude is that “((/ul))((ul))((hl))humankind’s continuing enhancement of the natural greenhouse effect is akin to playing Russian roulette with the earth’s climate and humanity’s life support system.

Investors poured $4.5 billion into more than 200 Chinese A.I. companies between 2012 and 2017, according to a white paper produced by Kai-Fu Lee, a former Google and Microsoft executive who now leads a venture-capital firm, Sinovation Ventures.","China's goal is to foster a $1 trillion A.I. industry by 2030. Last month Chinese A.I. start-up SenseTime raised $600 million in a deal led by Alibaba, reported as the largest-ever in the A.I. space. The deal gave SenseTime an implied valuation in some reports of more than $3 billion, or even as high as $4.5 billion.","\"SenseTime is the perfect case study in the difference between Chinese and Western technological development,\" wrote Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, in a recent report. \"Artificial intelligence, and especially the A.I. that powers visual analytics, is a critical technology for a raft of new products. The Western companies have their own advantages, to be sure. But the Chinese model of government sponsorship and private capital is coming on very strong. SenseTime may be the hit investment of the moment coming out of this approach, but it certainly won't be the last.\"","US research sector could struggle","By contrast, the U.S. research sector could be struggling for funding and policy support under the Trump administration.

According to the White House's National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan in A.I. research, China had already surpassed the United States, at least in terms of journal articles that mention \"deep learning\" or \"deep neural network,\" as far back as 2016.","\"Sadly, when it comes to science and innovation, the U.S. is moving in reverse by cutting funding for research, denying climate change and cutting investments in education,\" said Vivek Wadhwa, a distinguished fellow and adjunct professor at Carnegie Mellon University's College of Engineering and author of The Driver in the Driverless Car: How Our Technology Choices Will Create the Future.","U.S. leaders do not appear to be aware of A.I. developments, said Joshua Gans, business professor at the University of Toronto and co-author of Prediction Machines: The Simple Economics of Artificial Intelligence. \"President Obama discussed it [AI] on numerous occasions,\" he said. \"[Research funding cuts] is obviously bad news in terms of its ability to nurture scientific leadership.

China's Ministry of Science and Technology announced in November 2017 that it had formed a sort of dream team made up of the biggest Chinese tech firms — Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent — to lead the country's AI development alongside voice recognition software developer iFlytek. Each of these companies is hard at work cultivating the learning algorithms and hardware, and gathering the data, necessary to build a wide range of functional AI platforms.

In particular, ((ul))nuclear((/ul))((ul)) deterrence played a significant role in the way the U.S. built its national security strategy((/ul)). Nuclear deterrence was so pervasive that the very word “deterrence” itself became synonymous with nuclear deterrence. However, according to General John Hyten, Commander, U.S. Strategic Command, strategic deterrence in the 21st century does not equate to 20th century deterrence. ((ul))Strategic deterrence is a multi-polar, multi-domain problem and it is fundamentally different now than it was in last century. The myopic focus on nuclear options((/ul)) in a national deterrence strategy ((ul))falls short of the critical thinking required to provide U.S. national leaders with the options necessary for effective decision making.((/ul)) Today’s complex social-political environment requires more than just a nuclear element for strategic deterrence to be effective against a diverse set of adversaries. Deterrence today must leverage all six domains of warfare.","So what is deterrence? According to DoD Joint Publication 1, deterrence “influences potential adversaries not to take threatening actions” for fear of the overwhelming retaliation from U.S. military might. More simply, deterrence could be any action that convinces an adversary to not act due to perceived unacceptable costs or because “the probability of success [is assessed to be] extremely low.” For an adversary to believe costs will be unacceptable or that there is a low probability of success, it must assess the U.S. threat as credible and capable, regardless of whether it is nuclear or conventional. ((ul))((hl))Deterrence hinges on the adversary’s assessment of credibility and capability((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). ((/ul))During the Cold War the Soviet Union believed that use of nuclear weapons would lead to an overwhelming retaliation from the U.S.; and therefore, striking any NATO allies with nuclear weapons was not worth the cost.","Effects of a Multi-Polar Environment","The end of the Cold War brought to a close 50 years of a bi-polar world, and with it the simplicity of employing one strategy to deter a single adversary. ((ul))The multi-polar world of today brings adversaries who are motivated differently. Both rational and irrational actors must be considered((/ul)), which also causes national leaders to question the level of success strategic deterrence has on an adversary. Generally, it is believed strategic deterrence is effective only against a rational actor, and not an irrational actor. This is due to the perception that a rational actor will take into account some form of cost-benefit analysis prior to acting versus the irrational actor who might act without any consideration of the losses.","Further complicating the world environment is that ((ul))((hl))potential adversaries are watching and learning from U.S actions((/hl))((/ul)). This is not a new concept as adversaries have been studying each other for thousands of years to gain advantage. But General Hyten reminded us in a speech last fall that “in a multi-polar world, everybody watches you [the U.S.] everywhere.” His point was to highlight that ((ul))since the fall of the Soviet Union((/ul)), the U.S. has had a spotlight on it where ((ul))adversaries have been studying the asymmetric advantages of the U.S. and creating specific capabilities and methods to counter those advantages((/ul)). Thus, we must now recognize that ((ul))a deterrent method of the past may not be viable in the future((/ul))((ul)). The U.S. must seek out new deterrent strategies.((/ul))","Nuclear versus Strategic Deterrence","Nuclear deterrence remains the foundation of U.S. deterrence strategy. However, nuclear deterrence cannot be the sole pillar of strategic deterrence since nuclear deterrence is not a one-size-fits-all solution. The most recent National Security Strategy (NSS) reflects this requirement to expand deterrence. As Brian Willis points out in the recent “Multi-domain ops at the Strategic Level” article, the recent NSS and Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) make strides to extend deterrence to the space and cyberspace domains. ((ul))Creating non-nuclear deterrence options for use against potential adversaries is critical, especially against those actors who do not possess nuclear weapons.((/ul)) Michael Gerson suggests ((ul))the nuclear taboo reduces the credibility—and therefore the utility—of nuclear weapons, especially against regimes not possessing nuclear weapons or((/ul)) other ((ul))w((/ul))eapons of ((ul))m((/ul))ass ((ul))d((/ul))estruction. This thought process feeds back to the concept of credibility. The ((ul))adversary must know the capability exists and the U.S. is willing to use it. The U.S. must consider a more balanced approach to deterrence as two of its near-peer adversaries have done. China and Russia are starting to demonstrate new ideas and concepts about strategic deterrence.((/ul)) This new “deterrence” does not solely focus on nuclear weapons or even the military instrument of power. China defines this new way of thinking as “Integrated Strategic Deterrence” while the Russians have called it “Cross-Domain Coercion.”","People’s Republic of China Approach to Deterrence","The PRC’s approach is not focused on preventing actions in a given domain but about achieving certain political goals. Around 2001, PRC military literature started discussing a concept known as “Integrated Strategic Deterrence” which focuses on nonmilitary aspects of national power—diplomatic, economic, and scientific and technological strength—contributing to strategic deterrence alongside space and cyber capabilities. These actions could include demonstrating new capabilities through tests and exercises where international observers are watching, owning the majority of mineral mines that hold a certain type of element, or working with partner countries to launch a new satellite that helps map future droughts and plots areas that are farmable.","In 2007, the PRC tested an antisatellite (ASAT) technology demonstrator against a non-operational weather satellite. This test was publicized as a future scientific technology demonstration. This test demonstrated the PRC had a capability to engage satellites in Low Earth Orbit, which has now been turned over to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and is considered an operational military capability. It is also now a credible strategic deterrent in the space domain.","Another piece to the PRC’s deterrence is their dam building operations for water control and hydropower. According to open sources, the PRC owns 45% of the world’s dams with its nearest competitors being the United States at 14% and India at 9%. Dams have the potential to turn water into political weapons to be wielded in war, or instruments during peace to influence actions or behaviors of a neighbor. India is currently concerned with a number of China dam projects and their ability to reduce river flows into India.","The PRC’s “Integrated Strategic Deterrence” does not come without challenges. Unlike the U.S. who has the Department of Defense and Department of State coordinating different types of deterrent actions, the absence of an entity in the PLA to integrate and coordinate the employment of these capabilities makes it difficult to execute. However, it would come as no surprise to the casual observer to see the PLA start executing military, space, and cyber coercive activities in national level exercises in order to move “Integrated Strategic Deterrence” from theory and conjecture to fully operational in limited regional conflicts.","Russia’s Approach to Deterrence","The PRC is not the only competitor thinking about strategic deterrence from a non-nuclear perspective. About 30 years ago, Soviet literature introduced a concept we now know as Reflexive Control. This notion centers on the idea of driving your opponent to make decisions that are advantageous to you. This is commonly achieved through misinformation, either via “leaks” or providing a possible explanation to an unrelated event that causes your opponent to divert attention or respond. That concept has now evolved into “Cross-Domain Coercion.”","“Cross Domain Coercion” is Russia’s ability to orchestrate non-nuclear and informational influence to coerce an adversary. It maintains opaqueness that clouds the nature of aggression as well as the aggressor’s identity. This informational influence was apparent during both the United States elections in 2016 and Catalonia’s bid for independence from Spain in 2017. Multiple United States intelligence agencies have noted Russian misinformation on social media and mass media outlets. This campaign is a prime example of “Cross Domain Coercion” and used a soft instrument of power, in this case information, as a form of deterrence on a global scale. The purpose of this interference is still clouded but it must have satisfied Russian objectives if it was used in Catalonia months after the United States election.","Another form of this type of deterrence is Russia’s cyber-attacks in both Estonia in 2007, and Georgia in 2008. In both cases, the attacks were not solely focused on military targets but against government institutions, banks, ministries, newspapers, and broadcasters. These attacks were meant to confuse the population and drive the government towards compliance with Russian demands.","Whatever the objectives, Russia has telegraphed that future attacks will fall under “Cross Domain Coercion”. The threats against financial and economic institutions as well as those of energy sources will be activated in conjunction with the military component of coercion, such as special operations forces and strategic strike systems in order to influence the target country. With both the PRC and Russia, strategic deterrence is no longer monopolized by nuclear weapons. 21st century deterrence is dam building that has regional implications on precious resources and misinformation campaigns such as Deepfakes where machine learning systems can be trained to paste one person’s face onto another person’s body, complete with facial expressions, and could change the outcome of democratic elections.","U.S. Multi-Domain Strategic Deterrence","Consideration of deterrent effects other than kinetic weapons must be explored. ((ul))Strategic deterrence “applies to cyber, it applies to missile defense, and it applies to electronic warfare. It applies to every mission in U.S. Strategic Command.”((/ul)) Currently, ((ul))an adversarial attack can come through any domain, and that is why the U.S. must leverage the multiplicative advantages of all domains((/ul)). An adversary who is not deterred by a nuclear response may be deterred by fear of a cyber effect which degrades or destroys a country’s economic stability. Or it could be negotiations in the human domain which threaten sanctions against a country’s ability to trade. Maybe it is the threat of an information operations campaign with the goal of removing a governmental regime from power and destabilizing a nation state. Regardless of deterrence method, the adversary must perceive the U.S. as capable and willing to commit to the action for it to be an effective deterrent. The first step for the U.S. is talking about capabilities more openly so adversaries know about our capabilities and the conditions under which they would be employed. This does not mean we share the technical details of a capability, those should remain secret, but a general understanding of the effect created by the capability must be understood. Adversaries are not deterred by a capability if they do not know it exists.","Future Technologies and Deterrence","((ul))((hl))Technologies on the horizon have huge implications for the future of strategic deterrence((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) Hypersonic weapons have the capability of delivering multiple payload types to worldwide targets while rendering missile warning detection and missile defense programs obsolete.","Quantum computing has the ability to make encryption unbreakable unless you have quantum technology and increase transmission speeds to levels unheard of in today’s environment. This could deter an adversary from ever trying to break your encryption unless they spend the money to harness quantum computing. Finally, ((ul))Artificial Intelligence((/ul)) (AI) ((ul))and “combat cloud” services allow computers to easily share information and make decisions involving civil and economic processes to military tasks without ever needing human interaction((/ul)).

Governance shortfalls also will drive threat perceptions and insecurity in countries such as Pakistan and North Korea. Economic interdependence among major powers remains a check on aggressive behavior but might be insufficient in itself to prevent a future conflict. Major and middle powers alike will search for ways to reduce the types of interdependence that leaves them vulnerable to economic coercion and financial sanctions, potentially providing them more freedom of action to aggressively pursue their interests. Meanwhile, ((ul))the threat from terrorism is likely to expand((/ul)) as the ability of states, groups, and individuals to impose harm diversifies. The net effect of rising tensions within and between countries—and the growing threat from terrorism—will be greater global disorder and considerable questions about the rules, institutions, and distribution of power in the international system. Europe. Europe’s sharpening tensions and doubts about its future cohesion stem from institutions mismatched to its economic and security challenges. EU institutions set monetary policy for Eurozone states, but state capitals retain fiscal and security responsibilities—leaving poorer members saddled with debt and diminished growth prospects and each state determining its own approach to security. Public frustration with immigration, slow growth, and unemployment will fuel nativism and a preference for national solutions to continental problems. Outlook: Europe is likely to face additional shocks—banks remain unevenly capitalized and regulated, migration within and into Europe will continue, and Brexit will encourage regional and separatist movements in other European countries. Europe’s aging population will undermine economic output, shift consumption toward services—like health care—and away from goods and investment. A shortage of younger workers will reduce tax revenues, fueling debates over immigration to bolster the workforce. The EU’s future will hinge on its ability to reform its institutions, create jobs and growth, restore trust in elites, and address public concerns that immigration will radically alter national cultures. United States. ((ul))The next five years will test US resilience((/ul)). As in Europe, ((ul))tough economic times have brought out societal and class divisions((/ul)). Stagnant wages and rising income inequality are fueling doubts about global economic integration and the “American Dream” of upward mobility. The share of American men age 25- 54 not seeking work is at the highest level since the Great Depression. ((ul))Median incomes rose by 5 percent in 2015((/ul)), however, ((ul))and there are signs of renewal in some communities((/ul)) where real estate is affordable, returns on foreign and domestic investment are high, leveraging of immigrant talent is the norm, and expectations of federal assistance are low, according to contemporary observers. Outlook: Despite signs of economic improvement, ((ul))challenges will be significant, with public trust in leaders and institutions sagging((/ul)), politics highly polarized, ((ul))and government revenue constrained((/ul)) by modest growth and rising entitlement outlays. Moreover, advances in robotics and artificial intelligence are likely to further disrupt labor markets. Meanwhile, ((ul))((hl))uncertainty((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) is high ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))around the world((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) regarding Washington’s ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))global leadership role((/hl))((/ul)). The United States has rebounded from troubled times before, however, such as when the period of angst in the 1970s was followed by a stronger economic recovery and global role in the world. Innovation at the state and local level, flexible financial markets, tolerance for risk-taking, and a demographic profile more balanced than most large countries offer upside potential. Finally, America is distinct because it was founded on an inclusive ideal—the pursuit of life, liberty, and happiness for all, however imperfectly realized—rather than a race or ethnicity. This legacy remains a critical advantage for managing divisions. ((ul))Central and South America((/ul)). Although state weakness and drug trafficking have and will continue to beset Central America, South America has been more stable than most regions of the world and has had many democratic advances—including recovery from populist waves from the right and the left. However, ((ul))government efforts to provide greater economic and social stability are running up against budget and debt constraints((/ul)). Weakened international demand for commodities has slowed growth. The expectations associated with new entrants to the middle class will strain public coffers, fuel political discontent, and possibly jeopardize the region’s significant progress against poverty and inequality. Activist civil society organizations are likely to fuel social tensions by increasing awareness of elite corruption, inadequate infrastructure, and mismanagement. Some incumbents facing possible rejection by their publics are seeking to protect their power, which could lead to a period of intense political competition and democratic backsliding in some countries. Violence is particularly rampant in northern Central America, as gangs and organized criminal groups have undermined basic governance by regimes that lack capacity to provide many basic public goods and services. Outlook: ((ul))Central and South America are likely to see more frequent changes in governments that are mismanaging the economy and beleaguered by widespread corruption((/ul)). Leftist administrations already have lost power in places like Argentina, Guatemala, and Peru and are on the defensive in Venezuela, although new leaders will not have much time to show they can improve conditions. The success or failure of Mexico’s high-profile reforms might affect the willingness of other countries in the region to take similar political risks. The OECD accession process may be an opportunity—and incentive— for some countries to improve economic policies in a region with fairly balanced age demographics, significant energy resources, and well-established economic links to Asia, Europe, and the United States. ((ul))((hl))An ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))Inward West((/hl))((/ul))?

This inward view will be far more pronounced in the European Union, which is absorbed by questions of EU governance and domestic challenges, than elsewhere. The European Union’s internal divisions, demographic woes, and moribund economic performance threaten its own status as a global player. For the coming five years at least, the need to restructure European relations in light of the UK’s decision to leave the EU will undermine the region’s international clout and could weaken transatlantic cooperation, while anti-immigration sentiments among the region’s populations will undermine domestic political support for Europe’s political leaders.

((ul))China faces a daunting test((/ul))—with its political stability in the balance. After three decades of historic economic growth and social change, ((ul))Beijing, amid slower growth and the aftereffects of a debt binge, is transitioning from an investment-driven, export-based economy to one fueled by domestic consumption. ((/ul))Satisfying the demands of its new middle classes for clean air, affordable houses, improved services, and continued opportunities will be essential for the government to maintain legitimacy and political order. President Xi’s consolidation of power could threaten an established system of stable succession, while ((ul))((hl))Chinese nationalism((/hl))((/ul))—a force Beijing occasionally encourages for support when facing foreign friction—((ul))((hl))may prove hard to control((/hl))((/ul)).

Yet, at home, it faces increasing constraints as its stagnant economy heads into a third consecutive year of recession. Moscow prizes stability and order, offering Russians security at the expense of personal freedoms and pluralism. ((ul))Moscow’s ability to retain a role on the global stage((/ul))—even ((ul))through disruption((/ul))—((ul))has also become a source of regime power and popularity at home((/ul)). Russian nationalism features strongly in this story, with President Putin praising Russian culture as the last bulwark of conservative Christian values against the decadence of Europe and the tide of multiculturalism. Putin is personally popular, but approval ratings of 35 percent for the ruling party reflect public impatience with deteriorating quality of life conditions and abuse of power. Outlook: If the Kremlin’s tactics falter, Russia will become vulnerable to domestic instability driven by dissatisfied elites— even as a decline in status suggests more aggressive international action. Russia’s demographic picture has improved somewhat since the 1990s but remains bleak. Life expectancy among males is the lowest of the industrial world, and its population will continue to decline. The longer Moscow delays diversifying its economy, the more the government will stoke nationalism and sacrifice personal freedoms and pluralism to maintain control. An Increasingly Assertive China and Russia. ((ul))((hl))Beijing((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) and ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))Moscow((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) will seek to lock in((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) temporary ((/ul))((ul))((hl))competitive advantages((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) and to right what they charge are historical wrongs((/ul)) before economic and demographic headwinds further slow their material progress and the West regains its footing. Both China and Russia maintain worldviews in which they are rightfully dominant in their regions and able to shape regional politics and economics to suit their security and material interests. ((ul))Both have moved aggressively in recent years to ((/ul))((ul))exert greater influence((/ul))((ul)) in their regions, to contest the US geopolitically, and to force Washington to accept exclusionary regional spheres of influence((/ul))—a situation that the United States has historically opposed. For example, China views the continuing presence of the US Navy in the Western Pacific, the centrality of US alliances in the region, and US protection of Taiwan as outdated and representative of the continuation of China’s “100 years of humiliation.” Recent Sino-Russian cooperation has been tactical, however, and is likely to return to competition if Beijing jeopardizes Russian interests in Central Asia and as Beijing enjoys more options for cheap energy supply beyond Russia. Moreover, it is not clear whether there is a mutually acceptable border between what China and Russia consider their natural spheres of influence. Meanwhile, India’s growing economic power and profile in the region will further complicate these calculations, as New Delhi navigates relations with Beijing, Moscow, and Washington to protect its own expanding interests.

It failed in this mission.","First, Congress changed the existing H-1 temporary visa category to H-1B, added new requirements and set an annual limit of 65,000.

More than 20,000 of the green cards each year are devoted to immigrant investors, workers for jobs that don’t require a college degree, religious workers and others. More importantly, dependents (spouses and children) count against the 140,000 annual limit, accounting for about half of the total each year.","Third, the Immigration Act of 1990 unwisely retained per-country limits on employment-based immigrants. This continues to make no sense. It would be discrimination if a company said it will only hire a certain number of people of Chinese origin this year, yet collectively U.S. employers are only allowed to gain permanent residence for a limited number of people from any one country.

Kevin Yoder (R-KS), told me in an interview. “If you do some simple math, you’ll realize many of these individuals will go their entire lives without ever getting their green card.

One can also build up disease surveillance systems and create rapid-response BW investigation teams to look into any suspected development of illicit pathogens or any outbreak of associated disease.112 But the United States will still need a good deal of luck to discover many hypothetical biological weapons programs. Any countries bent on cheating will have a good chance of success in hiding their associated research and production facilities.","For Americans, who long led the way in biology, it is sobering and important to remember that even today, at least half of all important biological research is already done abroad. It often takes place in small facilities that are very hard if not impossible to identify from remote sensing.113","For such reasons, it is eminently possible that an advanced “bug”—perhaps an influenza-born derivative of smallpox resilient against currently available treatments, for example—could be developed by a future aggressor state. Such a bug could combine the contagious qualities of the flu with the lethality of very severe diseases.114 This could dramatically alter the calculations of BW use.","It is such a prospect that led University of Maryland scholar John Steinbruner to note “One can imagine killing more people with an advanced pathogen than with the current nuclear weapons arsenals.”115 The state developing this BW agent might simultaneously develop a vaccine against the new disease and use that vaccine to inoculate its own people. It might then use the biological pathogen as a weapon, or a threat, against another country. That could be a country it was interested in conquering; it could also threaten use against the United States and broader international community, to deter other countries from coming to the rescue of another state being attacked directly by the aggressor (analogous to how Saddam Hussein would have liked to deter the U.S.-led coalition from coming to Kuwait’s aid in 1990-1991). ((ul))((hl))If the United States faced the prospect of millions of its own citizens, or hundreds of thousands of its own troops, becoming sick((/hl))((/ul)) as it considered a response to aggression, and its only recourse was conventional retaliation, ((ul))its range of options could be limited((/ul)). Indeed, ((ul))the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))very troops called on to carry out the retaliation might become vulnerable to the disease, jeopardizing their physical capacity((/hl))((/ul)) to execute the conventional operation. Perhaps they could be wellprotected on the battlefield, once suited up, but they could be vulnerable before deployment, along with the rest of the American population. A potential adversary, seeing these possibilities, might find the concept of such an advanced pathogen very appealing.","Would there be a clear and definitive policy or moral argument against the use of a nuclear weapon in retaliation for a BW attack that killed hundreds of thousands—or even millions—of Americans? If the origin of the attack could be identified, as it might well be under numerous scenarios like the one sketched above, and if huge numbers of American civilians had been targeted, ((ul))the case for restraint would be hard to make((/ul)). At the least, it might be no stronger than the case for absorbing a nuclear weapons strike and choosing not to retaliate.","What if the United States thought a biological attack by an aggressor imminent? Or what ((ul))if it had already suffered one attack and others seemed possible((/ul))? In such circumstances, ((ul))there could be ((/ul))((ul))((hl))potential value in a nuclear retaliatory threat against the belligerent state((/hl))((/ul))((hl)), ((/hl))((ul))((hl))warning that any future use of biological attacks against the American people or U.S. allies might produce a nuclear response((/hl))((/ul)).116","In his classic book on just and unjust war, Michael Walzer asserted that “Nuclear war is and will remain morally unacceptable, and there is no case for its rehabilitation.” He also argues “Nuclear weapons explode the theory of just war. They are the first of mankind’s technological innovations that are simply not encompassable within the familiar moral world.” This would seem to argue (since biological weapons of certain types predated nuclear technologies) that in fact nuclear deterrent threats could never be justifiable against a biological attack. However, the logic of Walzer’s overall case against nuclear weapons is based explicitly on their indiscriminate and extreme effects—characteristics that advanced biological pathogens, which did not exist when he wrote the above words, would share. It is hard to argue that nuclear deterrence of an adversary’s possible use of an advanced pathogen that could kill a million or even ten million is less justifiable than the use of nuclear deterrence against an adversary’s nuclear arms.117","Indeed, it is possible that a nuclear response to such a biological attack might be conducted in a more humane way than the BW attack. Nuclear responses might target military bases and command headquarters, for example. To be sure, civilians would also be at risk in such a nuclear attack, but in proportionate terms a nuclear retaliatory blow could well cause a smaller fraction of casualties among innocent civilian populations than would a biological pathogen.118","U.S. policymakers had to bear in mind what is possible, at least theoretically, with advanced engineered pathogens. As Steinbruner notes, in discussing the contagiousness of certain flu-borne ailments,","“One strain infected an estimated 80 percent of the world’s population in a sixmonth period. Normally the incidence of disease among those infected is relatively low, as is the mortality rate of those who contract the disease. However, aviary strains of the virus have killed virtually all of the birds infected, which suggests the possibility of highly lethal human strains as well.”119","It was ((ul))these kinds of considerations((/ul)) that ((ul))led the Nuclear Posture Review to incorporate a hedge with regard to biological weapons((/ul)). While U.S. policy now is not to respond with nuclear weapons for a CW or BW attack by a non-nuclear weapons state, ((ul))the U.S. government retained the option to reconsider nuclear retaliation with regard to BW((/ul)) if there were major advances in biotechnology that were put to use for BW purposes.","But the other side of the argument is not inconsequential, either. Advanced biological pathogens may never be developed; nuclear weapons already have been not only developed but mass-produced and used. Retaining the threat of nuclear retaliation based on hypothetical concerns about possible future developments with biological agents that are far from inevitable may be unnecessary and unjustified. Surely it would be seen as cynical in the eyes of some, as a barely veiled attempt to find an excuse to maintain dependence on nuclear arms, and could undercut the value of the policy change in reducing the relevance of nuclear weapons. ","Moreover, ((ul))if a biological weapon with mass casualty features ever were developed((/ul)) and utilized to devastating effect, ((ul))the United States would not be constrained in its retaliatory options in any event((/ul))((hl)). ((/hl))((ul))((hl))If a million Americans((/hl))((/ul)), Germans, Italians or Japanese ((ul))((hl))were killed((/hl))((/ul)) by a superbug, ((ul))((hl))it would be hard to imagine a particularly strong international criticism if Washington reversed its previous pledges and responded with nuclear arms((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).((/hl)) If necessary, ((ul))this point could be conveyed privately through diplomatic channels((/ul)) to U.S. allies in advance, as a way of shoring up the credibility of the American extended deterrent even as the formal role of nuclear weapons was publicly constrained by announcement of a new doctrine. This could offer a way to avoid allowing the unlikely and extreme scenario of horrific biological attack to stand in the way of the more immediate agenda of reducing the role of nuclear weapons in U.S. security policy."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":149}},{"tag":"((hl))Brain ((/hl))((hl))drain low now- immigrants worldwide are returning home((/hl))","cite":"((hl))Hirsch 12((/hl)) (Michelle, “US Educated Immigrants Returning to Their Homelands”).

((ul))A few made the choice to avoid paying U.S. taxes on income earned abroad, but others are seeking greener pastures in the global economy((/ul)). With the U.S. facing a shortage of skilled workers, the wave of immigrants who are turning their backs on America is foreboding. A growing population of highly-educated Americans and foreign nationals educated in the states are less committed to living and working in the U.S., preferring to return to their homelands, many of which are emerging economies. “It’s only really come to light in the last year or two, but ((ul))((hl))we’re noticing a pattern of highly-skilled children of foreign-born U.S. immigrants leaving the U.S. for the countries where their parents were born((/hl))((/ul)),” said Madeleine Sumption, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. Sumption says the trend is strong in China, India and Brazil where dramatic economic growth over the last decade has opened up opportunities for entrepreneurship and led U.S. multinationals to hire overseas employees with western educations. “We’re putting together a picture of what’s happening partly from data and partly from anecdotal evidence since it’s a relatively new phenomenon.” Entrepreneurship experts say ((ul))a combination of booming developing economies, a still-soft U.S. economy, and difficulty obtaining green cards is driving foreign-born U.S. students who in past years would have remained in the U.S. on temporary visas to move home. “Some of the sheen has come off the U.S. economy as the place to make your fortune—especially if you’re from another country and have a U.S. education((/ul)),” said Robert Litan, vice president of research and policy at the Kauffman Foundation. “They know all the hot things that are going in the United States, and see a real opportunity to replicate them or do something similar in their home country that doesn’t have it.” According to data from the Brazilian government, U.S. applications for permanent work visas in Brazil rose 77 percent between 2008 and 2011, and temporary visas rose 36 percent during that time.

Litan says if the U.S. economy were growing at a 4 percent rate rather than the current rate of about 2 percent, the number of voluntary departures would likely decline. In contrast, India and China’s economies are expanding at around 7 percent. The challenge for the U.S. is how to keep educated foreign students in the U.S. That would require overhauling immigration policies. Currently, if a foreign student wants to remain in the U.S. after graduation, he or she must be sponsored by an employer and apply for an H1B Visa. Those visas, which expire after six years, preclude foreigners from starting their own companies. To stay here, the worker must apply for a green card, which also requires sponsorship The U.S. government caps the number of green cards available each year at 140,000, with every country limited to no more than 9,800."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":80}},{"tag":"((hl))The plan will make immigrants go to the United States((/hl))((hl)) – cross-apply their own evidence((/hl))","cite":"((hl))Raveesh 13((/hl)) ((hl))(((/hl)) S., “Brain Drain: Socio-Economic Impact on Indian Society”).

India spends only 0.9 percent of its GDP on healthcare, which promotes a large private healthcare industry that remains inaccessible to the poor. The wealthy can afford to be treated at a state-of-the-art hospital for a stomach ache, while the poor must walk long miles to receive treatment for sicknesses and sometimes discover that the medicine they need is unavailable. The shortage of doctors is staggering: there are only six doctors for every 10,000 patients. People in need of medical attention may spend days waiting in line for tests or drugs because there are simply not enough doctors and nurses available to tend to their medical needs. India is not the only country that suffers from brain drain, and the loss of human capital does not only affect the medical industry. Zimbabwe is struggling to keep its education sector from collapsing after losing 45,000 teachers in 2010 alone. Haiti has lost more college graduates than any other country in the world.

If these people are still making contributions to China, their families, and their home units, China may benefit from \"storing brainpower overseas.'\"* The following section will assess the extent of the loss, as well as the potential benefits to China of having so many talented Chinese abroad. One measure of the loss caused by the brain drain is the investment China has made in these non-returnees. Is China losing highly qualified people in whom the state had already made a major investment, or are many of the people going to the United States actually gaining much of their training overseas? According to Chang, despite the fact that the return rate of Taiwanese students studying in the United States has been only 18 percent, the loss is not so great because the vast majority of these people were trained in the United States and therefore reflect a \"migration and education\" pattern, rather than an exodus of high-class scientists and engineers.^ One can compare this to India, where a highly developed education system trains many Ph.D.s who are educated at home and then migrate to the developed world. In this case, the loss is much greater. ((ul))To assess this factor we looked at our interviewees' edu cational levels when they left China. Our findings suggest that there is significant loss, but not as much as that suffered by Third World coun tries that lose fully trained faculty members, mostly because ((/ul))((ul))((hl))China to date has not produced many Ph.D.s((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) In our sample, only 9 people (3.3 percent) had already attained the Ph.D. before leaving China; the major ity had completed their undergraduate training (49.1 percent) or had received an M.A. in China (44.6 percent) and had left China to get a Ph.D.^ This situation reflects the \"migration and education\" pattern in Taiwan's and South Korea's brain drain, where students went to the United States to earn the Ph.D. but did not return.

King tweeted that if reports of the president’s dealings are correct, “Trump base is blown up, destroyed, irreparable, and disillusioned beyond repair. No promise is credible.” But the president expressed confidence Republicans would stick with him even if he helps DACA recipients, telling reporters Thursday many are “very, very happy with what we’re doing.” The former campaign adviser endorsed Trump’s view, saying his support is “not tied to a specific policy, it’s tied to disrupting, it’s tied to shaking up the status quo.” “That’s what the base likes, bringing disruption to a city that has been mired in gridlock,” the aide said. On Friday, Trump tacitly acknowledged his newfound love for bipartisanship carries political risk. The president rallied supporters with a string of tough-talking early morning tweets on the terror attack at London subway station and an ESPN host who called him a white supremacist. He also reassured his backers that “CHAIN MIGRATION cannot be allowed to be part of any legislation on Immigration!” The term refers to the practice of immigrants with legal status sponsoring certain family members so that they can come to the U.S. Yet some of Trump’s allies continue to question why he seems to be prioritizing a top issue for Democrats, the status of immigrants in the U.S. illegally, over his campaign promise to build a border wall.

((/ul))((ul))((hl))The base cares about this((/hl))((/ul)).” Stein speculated the president might be “convinced that dealing on DACA will win him new supporters” who could help him win in 2020. The former campaign aide said Trump’s supporters wouldn’t have a better option in 2020, regardless of what he does on immigration. “It’s not 2016 Trump against 2020 Trump,” the aide said. “It’s Trump running against [Sens.] Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders, and it’s not like these voters would run to vote for the other side.” In the short term, conservatives' anger at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has provided a buffer for Trump against the backlash from his base. Frustration with the GOP leaders gave Trump room to break with them and strike an agreement with Democrats on a deal to extend the nation’s borrowing limit and fund the government. That dynamic could persist until Republicans begin notching legislative victories of their own. “He has such a diverse coalition and his base elected him knowing that he isn’t overly ideological,” said a GOP consultant who requested anonymity. “Poll after poll shows that Republicans will blame Ryan and McConnell every single time, so he has leeway here.” But the consultant warned ((ul))that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))cover might not last((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) forever, because “it’s never a good sign to have key influencers turn their backs((/ul)).” Key figures on the right warn that ((ul))((hl))immigration is a different animal from other policy((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) areas.

After President Donald Trump was sworn in, he rolled out more policies against globalization and focused on America’s interest.The US President believes immigrants are a key reason for terrorism that threatens the US homeland security and also for the unemployment problem. On January 27th, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order titled “Protecting the Nation from foreign terrorists entry into the United States” (the socalled “Muslim ban”). The measure prohibited for a period of three months the entry into the US of citizens from seven countries. The ban halted the Refugees Admission Program for 120 days, and suspended indefinitely the reestablishment in the USA of a Syrian refugee program launched by the Obama administration. Besides, the US media revealed that Trump government also intended to issue a decree to cancel the H1-B Visa Lottery system that prioritizes foreign students graduating from the US higher education institutions. The Draft Decree also was reported to revoke the Obama administration’s policy to extend from 12 to 36 months the STEM OPT (Optional Practical Training for students with Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics degrees). These new immigration policy measures encountered strong opposition both at home and abroad, especially the science and technology community.

In December, 2012, the Organization Department of the Central Committee of CPC, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and other 25 government agencies jointly issued the “Administrative Measures on Entitlement of Foreigners with Chinese Permanent Residence”. In June, 2015, the Ministry of Public Security expanded the fields in which foreigners who apply for a Chinese Permanent Residence (Chinese Green Card) can work, based on the regulations of the “Measures for the Administration of Examination and Approval of Foreigners’ Permanent Residence in China”. Since then, Beijing, Shanghai, Fujian, and Guangdong, among other places, adopted new policy measures for the issuance of visa and residence permits to foreigners, to build a more open and flexible environment for them to live and work in China. In March, 2016, Zhongguancun became the first area to pilot the 20 new entry and exit policies for foreigners adopted by the Ministry of Public Security to support mass innovation in Beijing. These measures are expected to make it easier for foreign talent to enter and exit China to start their own business.","On Feb. 6th, 2017, the central government made a step forward in the immigration policy reforms and required the effort to improve the permanent residence permit system, as it is required by the national talent development strategy.

((ul))((hl))This((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) fast-growing energy consumption ((/ul))((ul))((hl))requires ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))more reliable and efficient infrastructure and markets((/hl))((/ul)).

It will create a more efficient and better integrated energy network. In terms of energy project investment, the natural gas sector is already feeling the impact of the \"One Belt, One Road\" initiative. As demand increases across Asia for natural gas as a cleaner substitute for coal and oil, it is driving Qatar, Iran, Indonesia and Australia to raise their output. China and Russia have already signed a long-term natural gas contract and there is the possibility that North America will sell natural gas to East Asia in the future. As such, a hub and proper pricing system is necessary to facilitate the fast-growing market for natural gas in the region. Some of China's harbour cities such as Shanghai and Tangshan , in Hebei , have put forward the idea of developing a natural gas hub.

The stakes are high. ((ul))((hl))China should pay((/hl))((/ul)) close attention to the risks posed by water conflicts to ((ul))((hl))its Silk Road Economic Belt((/hl))((/ul)). China needs to lead by example by successfully managing the Ili and Irtysh rivers with Kazakhstan. Encouragingly, compared with its water policies on other major transboundary rivers, China has a relatively high level of institutionalised cooperation with Kazakhstan. For instance, the two countries signed an agreement on the common use and protection of transboundary rivers in 2001. And they launched the China–Kazakhstan Friendship Joint Water Diversion Project on the Khorgos River in April 2011. ((ul))China can take the lead in mediating water disputes among Central Asian countries((/ul)). As a first step towards this aim, China needs to expedite the conclusion of a comprehensive Agreement on Water Distribution of Cross-Border Rivers. More importantly, ((ul))((hl))China could help facilitate((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) the adoption of ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the ‘nexus approach((/hl))((/ul))((ul))’ to managing water conflicts((/ul)) in Central Asia. ((ul))The ((/ul))((ul))((hl))nexus approach recognises that water, energy and food systems are inseparable((/hl))((/ul)). Food production accounts for 70 per cent of total global freshwater withdrawals, making it the largest user of water. Water is also needed to produce, transport or use all forms of energy. Meanwhile, the food production and supply chain consumes about 30 per cent of total global energy. And energy is needed to produce, transport and distribute food as well as to extract and treat water. ((ul))((hl))Efforts in((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) the food and ((/ul))((ul))((hl))energy production systems could therefore help to alleviate water stress in Central Asia((/hl))((/ul)). While agriculture consumes 70 per cent of the fresh water usage in Central Asia, 50–80 per cent of that is wasted due to faulty irrigation systems. Agricultural modernisation will help to keep regional water conflicts under control. China has much to offer on this front. First, with ample foreign reserves, China could invest in Central Asia’s backward agricultural infrastructure, particularly in modernising its irrigation systems. Second, water-saving technologies and drought-resistant seeds from China could further reduce water demand in Central Asia’s agricultural sector. Third, by promoting interregional and intraregional agricultural trade across Central Asia, China could help facilitate the development of a better cropping structure. For instance, by importing water-intensive crops such as rice and wheat, Uzbekistan could allocate more of its arable land to the production of drought-resistant crops like potatoes. Finally, ((ul))((hl))rebuilding the((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) regional ((/ul))((ul))((hl))energy market((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) in Central Asia ((/ul))((ul))((hl))could help to normalise water ties between((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) the downstream and upstream ((/ul))((ul))((hl))countries((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).((/hl)) With some 300 days of sunshine per year and vast wind resources, ((ul))((hl))the potential for renewable energy((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) production in Central Asia ((/ul))((ul))((hl))is enormous((/hl))((/ul)).

To stop China from stealing classified information, Van Cleave recommends the U.S. go on the offensive against foreign spies. She laments the fact that former President Barack Obama weakened counterintelligence efforts by dividing America’s counterspy program into individual departments. Van Cleave continued: “The national head of counterintelligence was rebranded director of a security and CI center, his duties further dissipated by the fixation on leaks and insider threats driven by the grievous harm done by Snowden, Manning, et al.” She was referring to whistleblowers Edward Snowden and Bradley Manning.

The article called for the development of tactical laser weapons to be used in antiship missile defense systems, electromagnetic pulse weapons, radar-jamming technology and cyberweapons. Maj. Gen. Li Zhiyun, the director of foreign military studies at China’s National Defense University, published an anthology of the works of 64 Chinese military authors. The anthology details a long list of ((ul))U.S. military weaknesses vulnerable((/ul)) ((ul))to exploitation by((/ul)) “((ul))assassin’s mace” technologies((/ul)).

And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee: so will I destroy thy cities” (Micah 5:10-14). This passage describes the military downfall of end-time Israel (the Americans, the British, the Jews and other related peoples). When end-time Israel reaches the zenith of its power, God cuts off its armaments of war and throws down its strongholds. He breaks the pride of its power. Why? Because the people have turned away from Him to embrace “witchcraft” and “soothsayers.” This means the people look to false teachers who refuse to teach God’s commands.

We offer a theory of how ((ul))large scale immigration can result in real partisan shifts in the white population((/ul)).

It would be surprising if such a massive change in the makeup of the nation did not result in immigration playing a more central role in the minds of white Americans. Second, ((ul))irrespective of the actual fiscal consequences of immigration, there is an on- going and oft repeated threat narrative that links America’s immigrant and Latino populations to a host of pernicious fiscal, social, and cultural consequences((/ul)) (Perez forthcoming, Chavez 2008, Hopkins 2010, Brader et al 2008, Santa Ana 2004). This narrative emphasizes cultural decline, immigrants’ use of welfare, health, and educational services, their propensity to turn to crime, and their tendency to displace native citizens from jobs (Huntington 2005, Borjas 2001, Gimpel and Skerry 2008). Each of these concerns has been spelled out repeatedly and in great detail in the media, in the political sphere, and in scholarly outlets (Perez forthcoming, Brader et al 2012, Chavez 2008, Santa Ana 2004). Moreover, although many inside and outside of the political arena dispute the threat narrative, it appears that ((ul))((hl))the narrative has been absorbed by a significant segment of the white population((/hl))((/ul)). Across the white population attitudes on Latinos and immigration are diverse, but there is little doubt that ((ul))many white Americans express real concerns about immigration and hold negative attitudes toward Latinos. Recent polls suggest that well over half of white Americans feel that immigrants are a burden on the nation((/ul)), a slight majority think they add to the crime problem, and about half believe they take jobs away from Americans (CNN 2010). ((ul))For many, the changes that are occurring in America represent a real threat.((/ul)) Third, and critically for our account, ((ul))this threat narrative has recently taken on increasingly clear partisan implications((/ul)). Although there is still considerable variation within each party’s leadership on the issue of immigration, empirical studies demonstrate growing partisan divergence on immigration between leaders of the two parties (Jeong et al 2011, Miller and Schofield 2008). As we will see, these divergent stances on immigration are borne out by interest group ratings, voting patterns in state legislatures, elite partisan rhetoric, and the perceptions of the public. When Republican and Democratic leaders take divergent stances on immigration and other issues of special relevance to the Latino community and when Republicans stand more strongly against immigration((ul)), the two parties present individual white Americans with a stark choice.

This theory ((ul))predicts that contact with out-group members reduces prejudice toward them((/ul)). The mecha- nism runs as follows: through contact, individuals are exposed to new infor - mation about the out-group. Such new information can improve the understanding of the other group’s concerns and interests, help develop affec- tive ties that reduce feelings of threat toward out-group members, disprove negative stereotypes, and consequently lead to more positive views of the out-group. Originally developed for the study of racial and ethnic groups, contact theory has since been applied to a wide range of different group set- tings. In a comprehensive meta-analysis of over 500 contact theory studies written between 1940 and 2000, Pettigrew and Tropp (2006) find strong sup- port for the notion that intergroup contact reduces intergroup prejudice across a broad range of different types of out-groups and contact settings. However, ((ul))previous studies that have applied contact theory to under - stand natives’ attitudes toward immigrants arrive at mixed conclusions((/ul)). ((ul))((hl))Some studies find((/hl))((/ul)) that having friends or colleagues from ethnic minority groups or living in areas where ((ul))((hl))frequent contact with immigrants is more likely reduces((/hl))((/ul)) perceived threats and ((ul))((hl))anti-immigrant attitudes((/hl))((/ul)) (Ellison, Shin, & Leal, 2011; Fetzer, 2000; McLaren, 2003; Schlueter & Scheepers, 2010). ((ul))((hl))Other studies report the opposite or null findings((/hl))((/ul)) (Gravelle, 2016; see also Ford, 1986, for a review). For example, Fetzer (2000) finds support for the contact hypothesis in France and the United States but not in Germany. Other studies find that local contact with immigrants can heighten rather than reduce feelings of cultural threat, which in turn increases anti-immi- grant sentiment (Berg, 2010; Enos, 2014; Hopkins, Tran, & Williamson, 2014; Johnston, Newman, & Velez, 2015; Karreth, Singh, & Stojek, 2015; Newman, Hartman, & Taber, 2012; see also Newman, 2013). Proponents of contact theory concur that some factors can curb the positive effect of con- tact on prejudice (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006, 2011). These factors are cur - rently “the most problematic theoretically, yet the least understood” (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006, p. 767). 1 In this article, we respond to the calls for further theoretical development of the factors that curb the positive effect of contact by focusing on political predispositions. We do so by incorporating insights from the study of moti- vated reasoning. Specifically, ((ul))an extensive literature in psychology shows that individuals process information with a directional bias toward reinforc- ing their preexisting positions on a given issue((/ul)) (see Kunda, 1990, for a review). ((ul))That is, individuals use motivated reasoning, favoring arguments and evidence that support their existing views, while dismissing those that contradict them((/ul)) (Nyhan & Reifler, 2010; Rogowski, 2016; Taber & Lodge, 2006). We argue that ((ul))this affects((/ul)) not only ((ul))how people((/ul)) deal with new informa- tion but also how they ((ul))interpret and generalize their contacts and real-world experiences with out-group members. Liberal or leftist partisan affinities pre- dispose individuals to openness and tolerance. Individuals with leftist parti- san affinities are therefore more likely to((/ul)) respond to contact with out-group members in a manner expected by contact theory: They are likely to ((ul))posi- tively update their views of immigrants in general((/ul)). ((ul))((hl))However, individuals with conservative or rightist partisan affinities are more likely to find that positive encounters with immigrants contradict their predisposition to oppose social change and equality. Therefore, they are more likely to reject those experi- ences as sufficient evidence to change their preexisting views on immigrants in general((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) "],"stats":{"highlightedWords":70}},{"tag":"((hl))Studies that show contact with immigrants improves attitudes towards immigration are((/hl)) ((hl))inconclusive, and don't assume the impact on political behavior that our evidence shows((/hl))","cite":"Marisa ((hl))Abrajano((/hl)), University of California San Diego and Zoltan ((hl))Hajnal((/hl)), University of California San Diego, 20((hl))17((/hl))","text":["[White Backlash: Immigration, Race, and American Politics http://pages.ucsd.edu/~zhajnal/resources/white-backlash-manuscript.pdf CBO DUDA]","((ul))There is((/ul)), in fact, ((ul))growing evidence to suggest that this kind of racial threat mechanism is in place.

India has three million college graduates per year, which is problematic because there is a lack of educated work (Davis & Hart, 2010, p. 516). Indian’s cannot get work for the degrees they obtain. They then must look elsewhere, hence the brain drain issue. Additionally, Indians often suffer from a quality of life issue, where many regions are plagued with poverty and rolling blackouts.","((ul))Professor of Economics John Gibson and Senior Economist David McKenzie emphasize in their article Eight Questions about Brain Drain that the issue of brain drain should be taken very seriously by economists, due to its potential implications not just for a developing country’s economy, but for both the world’s economy and social sphere((/ul)) (p. 111). Basically, ((ul))((hl))brain drain has the potential to cause a ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))dangerous “domino” effect.((/hl))((/ul)) Logically speaking, overloading developed nations with highly educated workers while simultaneously draining developing nations of such workers is highly detrimental to both. The below data showcases which occupations are held by educated migrants, which also hail from developing countries.","((ul))Developed nations will have too many workers for not enough jobs, causing a decrease in average pay and an increase in either unemployment or highly educated workers in low education work((/ul)). Meanwhile, ((ul))((hl))developing nations, upon losing educated workers, continue to fall behind and have their economies weakened. As both these scenarios ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))lead to a weaker economy((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)), brain drain has the potential to be quite devastating to the world economy((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).((/hl)) After all, it damages all nations involved.","As Gibson and McKenzie (2011) note in their article, brain drain is not a new problem and has been written about in some top economic journals that regard it, rightfully, as an area of great worry and serious economic impact. Economists have a responsibility to carefully examine brain drain because it affects not only a single nation’s economy, but also the whole world’s economic system. Supply and demand could be imbalanced if supply outweighs demand. Developing countries are impacted from brain drain at more of a detriment. Skilled workers immigrate to more devolved countries to practice their professions. In a 2010 study, Gibson and McKenzie studied five countries and their top academic students to find their income would increase by $40,000-$60,000 per year if the gifted students were to move to a country more developed than their own. They believed these “barriers also restrict the extent to which lessskilled workers can react to the migration decisions of the higher-skilled,” due to limits in opportunity (2011). The migration of talented workers leads to fiscal decline when those students who relied on government subsidies leave and therefore no longer contribute as taxpayers (Gibson and McKenzie, 2011).","((ul))((hl))Brain drain does ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))not show damaging results right away((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)); rather, it ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))takes time to produce((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((/ul))((hl))any((/hl))((ul))((hl)) significant economic effects((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). The worry of economists is that this problem will balloon to unmanageable levels and action will not be taken against the growth of Brain Drai((/ul))n. The issue is the highly education individuals who leave for better opportunities are the only source that can improve their countries’ economic systems. ((ul))Developing nations rely on equilibrium, where they benefit from other countries’ stronger economies without those same economies drawing away all their resources, which include educated workers. Without this balance, there is no reinvestment back into their economy.((/ul))"],"stats":{"highlightedWords":67}},{"tag":"Indian growth strong now—brain drain reverses trend affecting key sectors ","cite":"Bhavthankar ’16 (“Brain drain now brain gain in ‘impatient’ India?:The growing strength of the Indian economy amidst a gloomy global scenario has made many Non Resident Indians (NRIs) to pack their bags and head back to India in search of better opportunities, writes ANIKET BHAVTHANKAR, http://theindiandiaspora.com/news-details/Spotlight/primary_news/brain-drain-now-brain-gain-in-%E2%80%98impatient%E2%80%99-india.htm)","text":["The ((ul))growing strength of the Indian economy amidst a gloomy global scenario has made many Non Resident Indians (NRIs) to pack their bags and head back to India in search of better opportunities.

Michelle Van Cleave, former national counterintelligence executive, said shortly after the creation of the office of the director of national intelligence in 2004, a national counterspy program against foreign spies was restricted during the administration of President George W. Bush. \"Unfortunately, the backsliding continued under President Obama,\" Van Cleave told two subcommittees of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee.

Along with Russian intelligence agents, Chinese technology spies have developed specific lists of technology for theft. Beijing uses clandestine agents, front companies, and joint research ventures in the theft program. \"Indeed, the United States is a spy's paradise,\" Van Cleave said. \"Our free and open society is tailor-made for clandestine operations.\" Michael Wessel, chairman of the congressional U.S.-China Economic Security Review Commission, testified that the ((ul))Chinese are focused on((/ul)) ((ul))stealing American advanced technology related to a((/ul))rtificial ((ul))i((/ul))ntelligence, ((ul))robotics, and other cutting edge technology((/ul)).

China also is infiltrating American universities by funding language and cultural centers called Confucius Institutes that are being used as cover for technology theft. About 100 of the institutes are operating on American campuses and use their funding as part of \"soft power\" efforts in the United States.

Chinese spies recruit students with appeals such as \"can you help China?\" Wessel said. Recent spy cases have included an electrical engineering professor at the University of Tennessee, John Reese Roth, who in 2008 was convicted of illegally sending defense technology through Chinese students back to China. In 2009, Ruopeng Lieu, a researcher at Duke University, passed sensitive technology data to China. The information helped Beijing create the Kuang-Chi Science Ltd, a multibillion metamaterials company engaged in wireless internet and mobile payment fields. In 2015, Chinese professors were among six defendants charged with economic espionage by the Justice Department. An indictment charged stolen American trade secrets were used to assist Chinese universities and state-run companies in China. Wessel said 20 percent of those working on advanced artificial intelligence at the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Lab are Chinese nationals. Also, 30 of the 38 post-doctorial researchers at the University of Maryland's Bing Nano Research Group are from China, he said. \"While we should continue to work to contribute to the world's efforts to address the most vexing problems facing the world, we must take greater steps to protect the fruits of our work,\" Wessel said. \"Efforts to infiltrate our universities and labs and exfiltrate their work must be a greater priority.\" Van Cleave, the former counterintelligence official, said greater efforts are needed to stem the loss of technology to China. \"Counterintelligence—identifying, assessing, and neutralizing foreign intelligence threats—has been little more than an afterthought in U.S. national security strategy, a legacy of neglect that has cost us dearly in lives lost, resources squandered, and dangers unchecked,\" she said. Counterspy efforts currently are divided among the FBI, CIA, and Pentagon. The division has created gaps allowing foreign spies to operate in the United States with impunity. Congress passed the Counterintelligence Enhancement Act in 2002 to fix the problems, but intelligence bureaucracies resisted the reforms and as a result counterspying has been weakened, not improved, Van Cleave said. \"((ul))((hl))U.S. counterintelligence((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))is finely tuned to work individual cases((/hl))((/ul)), but it is ((ul))((hl))not postured((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) globally ((/ul))((ul))((hl))to detect, deter, or disrupt((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))intelligence activities of China((/hl))((/ul)) or any other foreign power, or to execute strategic counterintelligence operations,\" she said."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":54}},{"tag":"Trump restricting visas for Chinese in tech and engineering","cite":"Taylor Hatmaker 18 – Reporter for Tech.

In January, Mo Hailong, one of six Chinese nationals Federal authorities accused of digging up seeds from Iowa farms to send back to China, pleaded guilty in a case that the Justice Department treated as a national security matter—not a normal criminal prosecution.

Chinese spies recruit students with appeals such as \"can you help China?\" Wessel said. Recent spy cases have included an electrical engineering professor at the University of Tennessee, John Reese Roth, who in 2008 was convicted of illegally sending defense technology through Chinese students back to China. In 2009, Ruopeng Lieu, a researcher at Duke University, passed sensitive technology data to China. The information helped Beijing create the Kuang-Chi Science Ltd, a multibillion metamaterials company engaged in wireless internet and mobile payment fields. In 2015, Chinese professors were among six defendants charged with economic espionage by the Justice Department. An indictment charged stolen American trade secrets were used to assist Chinese universities and state-run companies in China. Wessel said 20 percent of those working on advanced artificial intelligence at the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Lab are Chinese nationals. Also, 30 of the 38 post-doctorial researchers at the University of Maryland's Bing Nano Research Group are from China, he said. \"While we should continue to work to contribute to the world's efforts to address the most vexing problems facing the world, we must take greater steps to protect the fruits of our work,\" Wessel said. \"Efforts to infiltrate our universities and labs and exfiltrate their work must be a greater priority.\" Van Cleave, the former counterintelligence official, said greater efforts are needed to stem the loss of technology to China. \"Counterintelligence—identifying, assessing, and neutralizing foreign intelligence threats—has been little more than an afterthought in U.S. national security strategy, a legacy of neglect that has cost us dearly in lives lost, resources squandered, and dangers unchecked,\" she said. Counterspy efforts currently are divided among the FBI, CIA, and Pentagon. The division has created gaps allowing foreign spies to operate in the United States with impunity. Congress passed the Counterintelligence Enhancement Act in 2002 to fix the problems, but intelligence bureaucracies resisted the reforms and as a result counterspying has been weakened, not improved, Van Cleave said. \"((ul))((hl))U.S. counterintelligence((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))is finely tuned to work individual cases((/hl))((/ul)), but it is ((ul))((hl))not postured((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) globally ((/ul))((ul))((hl))to detect, deter, or disrupt((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))intelligence activities of China((/hl))((/ul)) or any other foreign power, or to execute strategic counterintelligence operations,\" she said."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":54}},{"tag":"Undermines US superiority and alliance system","cite":"USCC 16 – [“SECTION 3: CHINESE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES AND ESPIONAGE THREATS TO THE UNITED STATES”, November 16th, https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/Annual_Report/Chapters/Chapter%202%2C%20Section%203%20-%20China%27s%20Intelligence%20Services%20and%20Espionage%20Threats%20to%20the%20United%20States.pdf, AZ]","text":["((ul))((hl))Implications for((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))U.S. National Security China’s ((ul))illicit ((/ul))((ul))((hl))extraction of sensitive U.S.((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) national security ((/ul))((ul))((hl))info((/hl))((/ul))((ul))rmation ((/ul))((ul))((hl))has((/hl))((/ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((ul))((hl))far-reaching consequences for U.S.((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) interests((/ul)).

And when it comes to HUMINT operations against the United States, we are naturally drawn to the activities of the Russian intelligence services. Now let there be no doubt, Russian shenanigans with respect to the U.S. 2016 Presidential election have rightfully captured the attention of the nation, and placed the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the news on a daily basis. What isn’t being highlighted with the same degree of attention is the yeoman efforts of the counterintelligence professionals within the FBI and their colleagues across government in unraveling PRC intelligence efforts. 2017: THE YEAR OF THE CHINESE SPY? In the ((ul))first six months of 2017, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))we have seen((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))arrest((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) or conviction ((/ul))((ul))((hl))of a number of individuals((/hl))((/ul)), some Chinese citizens, most of them U.S. citizens, for their clandestine collaboration with the PRC intelligence services or operating on behalf of a state enterprise in stealing the defense, diplomatic or private sector information. Defense contractor, Kevin Mallory was arrested for espionage. He provided Secret and Top Secret documents, according to the Criminal Complaint filed by the Department of Justice The arrest of Candace Claiborne, a Department of State office management specialist. The arrest of Xu Jianqiang, who stole source code from IBM and shared it with a Chinese state owned entity. Five arrested for passing a U.S. company’s trade secrets to a Chinese entity. Nuclear engineer, Alan ho, pleaded guilty to violating the Atomic Energy Act and provided nuclear secrets to the PRC. This level of ((ul))counterintelligence activity is both alarming and impressive((/ul)). ALARMING ACTS OF CHINESE ESPIONAGE With each of these cases we learn more and more about the PRC intelligence service’s modus operandi. Indeed with the Mallory case, we see the PRC issued him a covert communications device to use from within the United States to communicate with his PRC handlers in China. The device allowed Mallory to provide to the PRC the classified documents he was able to put his hands on, electronically and covertly. In this writer’s experience, one only issues covert communication devices to trusted and fully vetted assets. The pragmatist in each of us knows that these six cases do not constitute all PRC HUMINT activity. Lest we forget, the OPM data breach provided an intelligence targeting gold mine of cleared US employees and contractors to the Chinese. The PRC is not going to take it’s foot off the accelerator. IMPRESSIVE OPPORTUNITY FOR INSIDER THREAT PROGRAMS The optimist in each of us knows the insider threat programs we create will increase the likelihood that those who opt to break trust with the United States by engaging in espionage on behalf of a hostile foreign intelligence organization will be detected.

In short, an increasingly large chunk of Americans believes a whole bunch of crazy things, and it is warping our politics. This basic story has been told plenty of times (my longer version is here), but the reason we should not let it out of our sights right now is the Mueller investigation.

What if there is no longer any evidentiary standard that could overcome the influence of right-wing media? The US is undergoing an epistemic breach Epistemology is the branch of philosophy having to do with how we know things and what it means for something to be true or false, accurate or inaccurate. (Episteme, or ἐπιστήμη, is ancient Greek for knowledge/science/understanding.) The US is experiencing a deep epistemic breach, a split not just in what we value or want, but in who we trust, how we come to know things, and what we believe we know — what we believe exists, is true, has happened and is happening. The primary source of this breach, to make a long story short, is the US conservative movement’s rejection of the mainstream institutions devoted to gathering and disseminating knowledge (journalism, science, the academy) — the ones society has appointed as referees in matters of factual dispute. In their place, ((ul))the right has created its own((/ul)) parallel set of institutions, most notably its own ((ul))media ecosystem((/ul)). But the right’s institutions are not of the same kind as the ones they seek to displace. Mainstream scientists and journalists see themselves as beholden to values and standards that transcend party or faction. They try to separate truth from tribal interests and have developed various guild rules and procedures to help do that. They see themselves as neutral arbiters, even if they do not always uphold that ideal in practice. The pretense for the conservative revolution was that mainstream institutions had failed in their role as neutral arbiters — that they had been taken over by the left, become agents of the left in referee’s clothing, as it were. But the right did not want better neutral arbiters. The institutions it built scarcely made any pretense of transcending faction; they are of and for the right. There is nominal separation of conservative media from conservative politicians, think tanks, and lobbyists, but in practice, they are all part of the conservative movement. They are prosecuting its interests; that is the ur-goal. Indeed, the far right rejects the very idea of neutral, binding arbiters; there is only Us and Them, only a zero-sum contest for resources. That mindset leads to what I call “tribal epistemology” — the systematic conflation of what is true with what is good for the tribe. There’s always been a conspiratorial and xenophobic fringe on the right, but it was (fitfully) held in place by gatekeepers through the early decades of America’s post-war prosperity. The explosion of right-wing media in the 1990s and 2000s swept those gatekeepers away, giving the loudest voice, the most exposure, and the most power to the most extreme elements on the right. The right-wing media ecosystem became a bubble from which fewer and fewer inhabitants ever ventured. As ((ul))((hl))the ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))massive((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))post-election((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))study((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) of((/ul)) online ((ul))media ((/ul))((ul))((hl))from ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))Harvard((/hl))((/ul)) (which got far too little attention) ((ul))showed((/ul)), media is not symmetrical any more than broader polarization is. “Prominent media on the left are well distributed across the center, center-left, and left,” the researchers found. “((ul))On the right, prominent media are highly partisan.”((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))When mapping out sources of online news, researchers found that the two basic poles were the center-left and the far-right. The center of gravity of the overall landscape is the center-left. Partisan media sources on the left are integrated into this landscape and are of lesser importance than the major media outlets of the center-left. The center of attention and influence for conservative media is on the far right. The center-right is of minor importance and is the least represented portion of the media spectrum. In short, ((ul))they ((/ul))((ul))((hl))conclude, “conservative media is((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) more partisan and ((/ul))((ul))((hl))more insular((/hl))((/ul)) than the left.” That insular partisan far-right media is also full of nonsense like Pizzagate that leaves the base continuously pumped up — outraged, infuriated, terrified, and misled. At this point, as the stories above show, the conservative base will believe anything. And they are pissed about all of it. As Brian Beutler wrote in a scathing piece recently, the mainstream media has never learned to deal with the right-wing bubble — it has not learned how not to take bad-faith lies seriously. And now we will all reap the consequences. ((ul))((hl))The incentives facing GOP politicians are not good((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))For Mueller’s findings to have any effect, they will have to break((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))some part of((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the basic dynamic on the right((/hl))((/ul)). Here’s how it works: Pundits and yellers in right-wing media compete to freak out the base and reinforce its allegiance to Donald Trump. ((ul))The base leans on politicians((/ul)). And ((ul))most ((/ul))((ul))elected GOP((/ul))((ul)) officials((/ul)) are in seats safe enough that ((ul))((hl))they fear a primary challenge((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))from the base more than a Democratic((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) challenger((/ul)). ((ul))((hl))The only way to stave off a primary is to pay obeisance((/hl))((/ul)). That’s why Jeff Flake and Bob Corker are leaving the Senate. They no longer have any control over what their constituents believe or want, and their constituents believe and want increasingly ugly things. Sen. John McCain is saying all the right things now, but back when he faced his own Tea Party challenger, he sprinted right as fast as he could. ((ul))((hl))GOP politicians((/hl))((/ul)) cannot (or ((ul))((hl))feel((/hl))((/ul)) that ((ul))((hl))they cannot((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)))((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) cross the base((/hl))((/ul)). And the base is currently being lied to about the Mueller investigation at a furious pace. The entire right-wing machine has kicked into high gear, led by the president himself, furiously throwing out chaff about Comey, Mueller, Obama, Hillary, the dossier, the uranium, the emails, and whatever else. On Monday, Fox News practically had a blackout of the Mueller news. Instead it covered fake Clinton scandals and cheeseburger emojis. It was such an embarrassing performance that multiple people on the news side leaked their disappointment to reporter Oliver Darcy. As always, the goal of this media/political offensive (there is no longer much distinction) is less to present some coherent alternative account of the facts than to fill the atmosphere with fog, to give those on the right enough cover to slough off the charges as yet another liberal plot. (See Vox’s Sean Illing’s great interview with Charlie Sykes, the conservative talk-radio host who criticized Trump and was excommunicated, for more on how this happens.) This reaction to Mueller in right-wing media was predictable enough. Similar things have happened so many times before, and been studied, analyzed, and documented. But to this day, no one knows how to stop or counter it. Mainstream institutions seem as unable as ever to resist its warping effects. It’s all playing out like some morbid script that we can only watch, stupefied. As familiar as this dynamic is, however, this episode is different. ((ul))We are drifting perilously close to a serious constitutional crisis.((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))What if we find out Trump is guilty and just can’t do anything about it? As long as the base is convinced that Mueller is an agent of the deep state (or whatever), it will punish any Republican politician that strays from the pack and criticizes Trump. For a GOP officeholder, standing up for democratic integrity could mean sacrificing reelection in 2018 or 2020. ((ul))((hl))As long as Republican((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))politician((/ul))((ul))((hl))s((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))are frightened by the base((/hl))((/ul)), the base is frightened by scary conspiracies in right-wing media, and right-wing media makes more money the more frightened everyone is, ((ul))((hl))Trump appears to be safe((/hl))((/ul)). As long as the incentives are aligned in that direction, there will be no substantial movement to censure, restrain, or remove him from office. What happens if nothing happens? Mainstream scholars do not think that Trump will be able to get away with simply ignoring Mueller’s findings or pardoning everyone involved. As Andy Wright, a law professor at Savannah Law School, put it, “with each abnormal, unbecoming, or dishonorable act, President Trump makes it harder for his appointees to defend him, harder for traditional Republicans to maintain their uneasy power alliance with him, and easier for Democrats to take the moral high ground and secure political advantage.\" But if there’s one thing non-experts like me have learned over the last few decades of watching US politics, it’s that experts are frequently caught flat-footed by the growing intensity of partisanship and the destruction of norms it has wrought. They are operating based on certain assumptions that it simply doesn’t occur to them that a politician can ignore. But politicians can. Mitch McConnell can simply refuse to hold a vote on a Supreme Court nominee. There’s no explicit rule or law that says he can’t, so he can, and he did. That one shocked and flabbergasted experts too, but just like all the other perverse steps down this road to illiberal lawlessness, they eventually took it on board and normalized it. Now they’re sure Donald Trump can’t simply brazen his way out of an indictment. What if they’re wrong about that? Say he pardons everyone. People will argue on cable TV about whether he should have. One side will say up, the other will say down. Trump may have done this, but what about when Obama did that? What about Hillary’s emails? Whatabout this, whatabout that, whatabout whatabout whatabout? There is no longer any settling such arguments. The only way to settle any argument is for both sides to be committed, at least to some degree, to shared standards of evidence and accuracy, and to place a measure of shared trust in institutions meant to vouchsafe evidence and accuracy. Without that basic agreement, without common arbiters, there can be no end to dispute. If one side rejects the epistemic authority of society’s core institutions and practices, there’s just nothing left to be done. Truth cannot speak for itself, like the voice of God from above. It can only speak through human institutions and practices. The subject of climate change offers a crystalline example here. If climate science does its thing, checks and rechecks its work, and then the Republican Party simply refuses to accept it ... what then? That’s what US elites are truly afraid to confront: What if facts and persuasion just don’t matter anymore? As long as conservatives can do something — steal an election, gerrymander crazy districts to maximize GOP advantage, use the filibuster as a routine tool of opposition, launch congressional investigations as political attacks, hold the debt ceiling hostage, repress voting among minorities, withhold a confirmation vote on a Supreme Court nominee, defend a known fraud and sexual predator who has likely colluded with a foreign government to gain the presidency — they will do it, knowing they’ll be backed by a relentlessly on-message media apparatus. And if that’s true, if the very preconditions of science and journalism as commonly understood have been eroded, then all that’s left is a raw contest of power. Donald Trump has the power to hold on to the presidency, as long as elected Republicans, cowed by the conservative base, support him.

The latter include not just Stephen Bannon’s “handful of media elites” but many others who are appalled and outraged and find themselves forced to live under the pall of permanent political anxiety that hangs over the nation’s cities. It is our outrage, our disgust, our knee-jerk shock and condemnation that animate the play and give verisimilitude to the battle being fought. We are the enemy and our screams of dismay are vital to the drama. Behind the controversies about crowd size and alternative facts and illegal voters and Muslim bans, all the shock and alarm and political fatigue can be reduced to a dawning horrified recognition that ((ul))President Trump is indeed…Donald Trump. His uttering a thirty-five-word oath((/ul)) of office ((ul))did not magically make him into someone else; he is determined to change the office much more than the office could ever change him((/ul)). How could anyone have doubted that President Trump would be Donald Trump plus great power and not Donald Trump plus great restraint? ((ul))And((/ul)) that he would be((ul)) determined to use that newfound power to begin to do pretty much what he told his base he was going to do((/ul))? And—a final irony—that his very determination to break crockery and spread chaos and disruption is a major obstacle standing between him and the “new political order” whose birth his Svengali Bannon claims he will oversee. The necessity for continual disruption, constant outrage, maintaining an iron grip on the news cycle, and sheer winning without ever retreating means he has a grand proclivity for getting in his own way—“stepping on his own dick,” in political parlance—and we need, not for the first time, to let ourselves be grateful for that. It has thus far proved to be the hated status quo’s most important protection—not least because in very short order he has managed to produce a growing cadre of adversaries within the government itself. Most important, Trump’s aggressive and reckless sallies against intelligence professionals have secured him powerful enemies within the national security apparatus, who have increasingly been making use of their contacts in the elite press—particularly The Washington Post and The New York Times—to fight back and undermine his new administration. This is an important part of the so-called Russia scandal: that the “intelligence services,” in the words of Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, “seem to be at war” with the new president.3 That war has already claimed a high-level casualty in the person of General (retired) Michael Flynn, the president’s first national security adviser, who was fired after only twenty-four days in the job. Though Trump has railed against “illegal leaks” and declared that Flynn “was treated very unfairly by the media,” this side of the story—the bureaucratic war being waged against Trump from within the government—by its nature cannot be adequately told in the press itself, because reporters, however much they resist acknowledging it, in effect are vital players. This storyline is obscured, one might say, by the storytellers’ own shadows. Four weeks of the Trump ascendancy have been an ongoing seminar on where norms end and laws begin, on how much of what we had relied on when it came to the president’s conduct rested largely on a heretofore unquestioned foundation of centuries-old custom. That the president would express respect for the prerogatives of Congress and the judiciary, that he would acknowledge the country’s need for an independent press, that he would generally tell the truth and hold in respect the public record: in little more than the time it took to recite the oath of office much of this has been swept away. Donald Trump is a proud shatterer of these norms, and the louder the crash and splatter the better: for to his supporters such norms are nostrums, antiquated excuses for the elite’s own self-protection, and the wails of outrage and protest mean their hero is doing what they sent him to Washington to do. The norms are gone, perhaps never to be fully restored, and we have advanced now to the laws. The dividing line is surprisingly murky. That the president would not use his office to promote his personal business, for example, depends not only on the so-called emoluments clause of the Constitution but a good many subsidiary norms that Trump began shattering some time ago, when he refused to release his tax returns during the campaign. (His long-standing vow to release them once an audit was completed has been quietly abandoned.4) It seems plain now that in the near term the emoluments clause has in common with these norms that it requires political animation: that it has life only to the degree that those in power are willing to enliven it. ((ul))((hl))Thus far Republicans((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))in Congress, still stunned to find themselves enjoying an undreamed-of monopoly on power and struggling to craft a workable political program not based solely on ressentiment,((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))have shown themselves ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))uninterested((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) in pressing Trump((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) on his business entanglements and seem willing to stand by and let the presidency become a source of great wealth for the Trump family((/ul)). Thus do sacred cows perish, not with a bellow but with a whimper. Ours is famously said to be a government of laws, not of men, and yet we find in the Age of Trump that the laws depend on men and women willing to step forward and press them and that such are not to be found in the dominant party in Congress. Republicans are too divided and too focused on the main chance to move to protect what suddenly appear to be abstract principles. In an age when their party cannot muster a national popular vote majority they find themselves unaccountably in full possession of two branches of government and face the task of mastering their divisions sufficiently to pass a political program that won’t further doom them to the wilderness. This means adopting policies of opposition designed to cultivate and harvest resentment, such as repealing Obamacare, which provides health insurance to more than twenty million Americans, while somehow shaping them into a positive program that they can present to constituents as having improved their lives. It is a daunting task and thus far they show few signs of being up to it. Untroubled by norms, President Trump required only two weeks to come face-to-face with laws in the form not of Congress but of three judges of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Once again banning Muslims was what he had promised his base he would do. That the executive order itself was a legal mess in its drafting and in its execution stemmed both from the modus operandi that the ((ul))Trump((/ul)) team has adopted—policies closely held, drafts jealously sheltered from the eyes of those even in the departments or agencies responsible for carrying them out (taking a page from Dick Cheney’s post–September 11 playbook)—and perhaps from the desire of the president and his advisers to stage a fight with a major institutional force not yet recumbent before him: the judiciary. Thus the president’s assertion of his “unreviewable” powers in the face of “so-called” judges was not just absurd or ignorant but a bit of bait, establishing the basis for blaming the judiciary for any terrorist attack that was to come. On this he tweeted indefatigably and repeatedly: “Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril,” he said in his most explicit tweet. “If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!” Then: “I have instructed Homeland Security to check people coming into our country VERY CAREFULLY. The courts are making the job very difficult!” “People,” of course, are not “pouring in,” certainly not from the seven countries targeted. But the phrase ((ul))links((/ul)) once again ((ul))the country’s vital security to the complex of issues at the heart of Trump’s “America First” politics: trade, immigration, and terrorism. Fortress America is being assailed by((/ul)) foreigners who pour into the country and take our jobs, by ((ul))elite technocrats((/ul)) (“stupid people”) ((ul))who negotiate trade deals that leave our borders unprotected, by traitorous businessmen who move factories abroad((/ul)), and by terrorists who take advantage of the nonexistent immigration safeguards to penetrate our shores. Everywhere the Other threatens. Everywhere the stupid, ineffectual, corrupt, self-dealing elites do nothing to protect the Forgotten American, in effect allying themselves with the threatening outsiders, becoming, in reality if not intent, traitors. As Trump proclaimed from the Capitol scarcely a month ago, “this stops, right here and right now.” But now “so-called judges” stand in the president’s way. The president will likely get his immigration ban, in one form or another, by backing up, rewriting the executive order, and proclaiming victory. Commentators will bemoan the fiasco that his first immigration rollout became. But Trump will have established the precedent of saddling the judiciary with responsibility for the next attack. Jack Goldsmith, the former head of the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel under George W. Bush and now a professor at Harvard Law School, notes that “Trump is setting the scene to blame judges after an attack that has any conceivable connection to immigration.” He goes on: If Trump loses in court he credibly will say to the American people that he tried and failed to create tighter immigration controls. This will deflect blame for the attack. And it will also help Trump to enhance his power after the attack. After a bad terrorist attack at home, politicians are always under intense pressure to loosen legal constraints. (This was even true for near-misses, such as the failed Underwear bomber, which caused the Obama administration to loosen constraints on its counterterrorism policies in many ways.) Courts feel these pressures, and those pressures will be significantly heightened, and any countervailing tendency to guard against executive overreaction diminished, if courts are widely seen to be responsible for an actual terrorist attack. More broadly, the usual security panic after a bad attack will be enhanced quite a lot—in courts and in Congress—if before the attack legal and judicial constraints are seen to block safety. If Trump assumes that there will be a bad terrorist attack on his watch, blaming judges now will deflect blame and enhance his power more than usual after the next attack.5 One might add that Trump’s executive order and the presidential Twitter assault on the judiciary that followed have set up the judiciary to be blamed following any attack, not just one having “any conceivable connection to immigration.” In his followers’ view Trump has acted to protect the country and “political” judges have blocked him. He has put them in a position to take the fall. Perhaps this was not the original plan but with Trump, it is safe to say, there will likely never be an original plan that plays out to the end. As the hapless Jeb Bush observed, Trump was “a chaos candidate and he’d be a chaos president.” Better to say that Trump uses chaos as a vital element in his tactics, perhaps having learned during his long career to capitalize on the chaos that his recklessness, ignorance, and aggression inevitably create. ((ul))One might call the((/ul)) resulting ((ul))tactics “((/ul))((ul))shock and opportunity”: Trump uses chaos to shock his opponents into varying crouches of outrage and contempt and then lunges forward amid the tumult wherever he sees an opportunity((/ul))((ul)) presenting itself.((/ul)) No wonder he thinks of himself as the supreme “counter-puncher.” His virtuosity is in his opportunism. ((ul))It is against this reality that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))we must see ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))likelihood of a crisis as the ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))vital ((/ul))((ul))((hl))springboard of a Trump presidency, ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))especially an increasingly shaky, unpopular, and unstable one((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). ((/ul))((ul))((hl))The lower his poll numbers((/hl))((/ul)), the more outlandish his lies, the greater the resistance from opponents within the bureaucracies, the thicker his scandals and chaos, ((ul))((hl))the likelier he will be to seek to use a crisis((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) and all the opportunities it offers to lever himself from a position of defensiveness to that of dominating power((/ul)). It is impossible to say when ((ul))such a crisis might((/ul)) present itself or what it might ((ul))be((/ul)): A confrontation with Iran in the Persian Gulf? ((ul))((hl))A dust-up with China over its claimed possessions in the South China Sea((/hl))((/ul))((ul))?((/ul)) A terrorist attack on American soil? There is no way of predicting, but ((ul))it ((/ul))((ul))((hl))is worth taking very seriously((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) that some sort of crisis will come((/ul)) and that, given Trump’s past behavior, his ruthless opportunism, and his drumbeat emphasis on “protecting the country,” such a crisis might well serve as a turning point in a Trump presidency, particularly one that is increasingly under siege. Consider the possibility of a terrorist attack on American soil, even a failed one. Not only would such an attack, as noted, put Trump in a perfect position to strike out at the judiciary, a major countervailing institution, it would offer him the political leverage to put down various rebellions within the bureaucracy, particularly within the intelligence agencies. There is no way to know whether such an attack will come but one can say that Trump, by attempting to strike out at Muslims generally, as he had vowed to do, has managed to place the Islamic State in the tempting position of being able to affirm, by attacking the United States, that it is the avenger of all Muslims. No accident that its propagandists have been nothing short of exultant, dubbing Trump’s executive order “the blessed order” and thus raising it to the level of the United States’ “blessed invasion” of Iraq as a miracle savior of its cause. If, as the Islamic State has asserted, the goal of its attacks in the West has been to “eliminate the gray zone”—to place “Muslims in the West…between one of two choices,” to either “apostatize or [migrate] to the Islamic State, and thereby escape persecution from the Crusader government and citizens”6—then Trump’s immigration ban goes far toward accomplishing the same thing: isolating Islamic communities, placing them all among a besieged minority whose travel is restricted and whose loyalty to their adopted countries is put in question. Already several jihadist tweeters asserted that the prophecy of the late Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born cleric killed in a drone attack in Yemen in 2011, that the “West would eventually turn against its Muslim citizens,” had been fulfilled.7 If one sought to design a policy to encourage radicalization, it would be hard to suggest a better one. One needn’t posit an administration master plan to notice that a further attack, even an unsuccessful one, will find the political ground well prepared. The panic over security that follows will open the way to a variety of measures to “protect the country,” few or none of which might have been necessary to prevent the attack in the first place. As we have seen, after an attack politicians seize the opportunity to act, not least to deflect blame from themselves, and we can expect President Donald (“The hour of action has arrived!”) Trump, after his repeated vows to keep the country safe, to act aggressively and comprehensively. How far he might go would depend on the severity of an attack, the ambitions of the administration, and perhaps how cornered the president feels himself to be. What measures might we expect under a Trump state of emergency? Probably strong steps against refugees, aliens, and immigrants. Suspending all entry of refugees. Widespread deportations. Expelling many green card holders. Further tightening and even suspending immigration. Mosques might be placed under surveillance, the much-discussed Muslim registry established. More broadly, and again depending on the severity of an attack, bulk collection of metadata might be reinstituted along with other forms of domestic surveillance. Long-standing constraints on the military and the CIA operating domestically might be loosened or eliminated. Black sites would be reestablished and torture reintroduced. The cells at Guantánamo, nearly empty now, would once again begin to fill. The standing post–September 11 Authorization for the Use of Military Force might be expanded or replaced, allowing unlimited military strikes abroad—and, perhaps, at home. The latter might lead, in the case of a particularly severe attack, to the suspension of habeas corpus. Certainly if such an attack were to come during the current Congress there is no reason to expect anything other than majority cooperation and support, not only for Trump’s specific responses to the attack but for the rest of his program. Democrats, whom Trump would denounce as worse than judges in their obstructionism, would be on the defensive. And the courts, whose pushback in any case would take much longer—as it did after September 11—will have been politically hamstrung by a commander in chief who will be in a position to declare, and to repeat, that he had warned the “political judges” not to second-guess him in what was needed to protect the country but that they had not listened. He will not be shy in saying the same about the press, “the most dishonest human beings on earth.” By then his political drama will have been elevated from a battle against elites and the status quo to a heroic struggle for the survival of the nation. As the hero was fond of telling his crowds during the campaign: if he lost, “we won’t even have a country anymore.” There is little reason to suspect they don’t believe it still and no reason to think he does not. “Never let a crisis go to waste,” President Obama’s first chief of staff was fond of saying. It is fair to expect that, in the face of opportunities to increase his power, destroy the opposition, and build his “new political order,” President Trump will once again gaze upon the darkening skies and see only sunshine."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":83}},{"tag":"US-China nuclear war causes extinction","cite":"Wittner 12 [Lawrence, PhD, Professor of History emeritus at the State University of New York/Albany, has written extensively about nuclear war, “Is a Nuclear War With China Possible?”, first published on 11/30/11 and updated on 1/30/12, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lawrence-wittner/nuclear-war-china_b_1116556.html]","text":["But what would that “victory” entail?

As the battle over that new political order is enacted on the national stage, we have all become the dragooned antagonists in the play. This is what it is to live in the realm of the Big Man: his drama perforce is ours. ((ul))Relentless political struggle, permanent revolution, shattering of norms, scandal and controversy, the capital hip-deep in broken crockery: this is what his supporters signed on for and this is what he is determined to give them; perhaps he knows how to give them little else((/ul)). ((ul))To him ((/ul))((ul))((hl))they are everything, his base((/hl))((/ul))((ul)): “This is a beautiful movement!”((/ul)) “They’ve never seen a movement like this in our country before.” ((ul))((hl))They are his((/hl))((/ul)) creation, ((ul))((hl))permanent suppliers of the adulation and self-affirmation he craves((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul))2 ((ul))Now they cheer and hoot((/ul)) and scoff while their hero, saber in hand, slashes and hacks at his enemies among the hated status quo. The latter include not just Stephen Bannon’s “handful of media elites” but many others who are appalled and outraged and find themselves forced to live under the pall of permanent political anxiety that hangs over the nation’s cities. It is our outrage, our disgust, our knee-jerk shock and condemnation that animate the play and give verisimilitude to the battle being fought. We are the enemy and our screams of dismay are vital to the drama. Behind the controversies about crowd size and alternative facts and illegal voters and Muslim bans, all the shock and alarm and political fatigue can be reduced to a dawning horrified recognition that ((ul))President Trump is indeed…Donald Trump. His uttering a thirty-five-word oath((/ul)) of office ((ul))did not magically make him into someone else; he is determined to change the office much more than the office could ever change him((/ul)). How could anyone have doubted that President Trump would be Donald Trump plus great power and not Donald Trump plus great restraint? ((ul))And((/ul)) that he would be((ul)) determined to use that newfound power to begin to do pretty much what he told his base he was going to do((/ul))? And—a final irony—that his very determination to break crockery and spread chaos and disruption is a major obstacle standing between him and the “new political order” whose birth his Svengali Bannon claims he will oversee. The necessity for continual disruption, constant outrage, maintaining an iron grip on the news cycle, and sheer winning without ever retreating means he has a grand proclivity for getting in his own way—“stepping on his own dick,” in political parlance—and we need, not for the first time, to let ourselves be grateful for that. It has thus far proved to be the hated status quo’s most important protection—not least because in very short order he has managed to produce a growing cadre of adversaries within the government itself. Most important, Trump’s aggressive and reckless sallies against intelligence professionals have secured him powerful enemies within the national security apparatus, who have increasingly been making use of their contacts in the elite press—particularly The Washington Post and The New York Times—to fight back and undermine his new administration. This is an important part of the so-called Russia scandal: that the “intelligence services,” in the words of Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, “seem to be at war” with the new president.3 That war has already claimed a high-level casualty in the person of General (retired) Michael Flynn, the president’s first national security adviser, who was fired after only twenty-four days in the job. Though Trump has railed against “illegal leaks” and declared that Flynn “was treated very unfairly by the media,” this side of the story—the bureaucratic war being waged against Trump from within the government—by its nature cannot be adequately told in the press itself, because reporters, however much they resist acknowledging it, in effect are vital players. This storyline is obscured, one might say, by the storytellers’ own shadows. Four weeks of the Trump ascendancy have been an ongoing seminar on where norms end and laws begin, on how much of what we had relied on when it came to the president’s conduct rested largely on a heretofore unquestioned foundation of centuries-old custom. That the president would express respect for the prerogatives of Congress and the judiciary, that he would acknowledge the country’s need for an independent press, that he would generally tell the truth and hold in respect the public record: in little more than the time it took to recite the oath of office much of this has been swept away. Donald Trump is a proud shatterer of these norms, and the louder the crash and splatter the better: for to his supporters such norms are nostrums, antiquated excuses for the elite’s own self-protection, and the wails of outrage and protest mean their hero is doing what they sent him to Washington to do. The norms are gone, perhaps never to be fully restored, and we have advanced now to the laws. The dividing line is surprisingly murky. That the president would not use his office to promote his personal business, for example, depends not only on the so-called emoluments clause of the Constitution but a good many subsidiary norms that Trump began shattering some time ago, when he refused to release his tax returns during the campaign. (His long-standing vow to release them once an audit was completed has been quietly abandoned.4) It seems plain now that in the near term the emoluments clause has in common with these norms that it requires political animation: that it has life only to the degree that those in power are willing to enliven it. ((ul))((hl))Thus far Republicans((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))in Congress, still stunned to find themselves enjoying an undreamed-of monopoly on power and struggling to craft a workable political program not based solely on ressentiment,((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))have shown themselves ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))uninterested((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) in pressing Trump((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) on his business entanglements and seem willing to stand by and let the presidency become a source of great wealth for the Trump family((/ul)). Thus do sacred cows perish, not with a bellow but with a whimper. Ours is famously said to be a government of laws, not of men, and yet we find in the Age of Trump that the laws depend on men and women willing to step forward and press them and that such are not to be found in the dominant party in Congress. Republicans are too divided and too focused on the main chance to move to protect what suddenly appear to be abstract principles. In an age when their party cannot muster a national popular vote majority they find themselves unaccountably in full possession of two branches of government and face the task of mastering their divisions sufficiently to pass a political program that won’t further doom them to the wilderness. This means adopting policies of opposition designed to cultivate and harvest resentment, such as repealing Obamacare, which provides health insurance to more than twenty million Americans, while somehow shaping them into a positive program that they can present to constituents as having improved their lives. It is a daunting task and thus far they show few signs of being up to it. Untroubled by norms, President Trump required only two weeks to come face-to-face with laws in the form not of Congress but of three judges of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Once again banning Muslims was what he had promised his base he would do. That the executive order itself was a legal mess in its drafting and in its execution stemmed both from the modus operandi that the ((ul))Trump((/ul)) team has adopted—policies closely held, drafts jealously sheltered from the eyes of those even in the departments or agencies responsible for carrying them out (taking a page from Dick Cheney’s post–September 11 playbook)—and perhaps from the desire of the president and his advisers to stage a fight with a major institutional force not yet recumbent before him: the judiciary. Thus the president’s assertion of his “unreviewable” powers in the face of “so-called” judges was not just absurd or ignorant but a bit of bait, establishing the basis for blaming the judiciary for any terrorist attack that was to come. On this he tweeted indefatigably and repeatedly: “Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril,” he said in his most explicit tweet. “If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!” Then: “I have instructed Homeland Security to check people coming into our country VERY CAREFULLY. The courts are making the job very difficult!” “People,” of course, are not “pouring in,” certainly not from the seven countries targeted. But the phrase ((ul))links((/ul)) once again ((ul))the country’s vital security to the complex of issues at the heart of Trump’s “America First” politics: trade, immigration, and terrorism. Fortress America is being assailed by((/ul)) foreigners who pour into the country and take our jobs, by ((ul))elite technocrats((/ul)) (“stupid people”) ((ul))who negotiate trade deals that leave our borders unprotected, by traitorous businessmen who move factories abroad((/ul)), and by terrorists who take advantage of the nonexistent immigration safeguards to penetrate our shores. Everywhere the Other threatens. Everywhere the stupid, ineffectual, corrupt, self-dealing elites do nothing to protect the Forgotten American, in effect allying themselves with the threatening outsiders, becoming, in reality if not intent, traitors. As Trump proclaimed from the Capitol scarcely a month ago, “this stops, right here and right now.” But now “so-called judges” stand in the president’s way. The president will likely get his immigration ban, in one form or another, by backing up, rewriting the executive order, and proclaiming victory. Commentators will bemoan the fiasco that his first immigration rollout became. But Trump will have established the precedent of saddling the judiciary with responsibility for the next attack. Jack Goldsmith, the former head of the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel under George W. Bush and now a professor at Harvard Law School, notes that “Trump is setting the scene to blame judges after an attack that has any conceivable connection to immigration.” He goes on: If Trump loses in court he credibly will say to the American people that he tried and failed to create tighter immigration controls. This will deflect blame for the attack. And it will also help Trump to enhance his power after the attack. After a bad terrorist attack at home, politicians are always under intense pressure to loosen legal constraints. (This was even true for near-misses, such as the failed Underwear bomber, which caused the Obama administration to loosen constraints on its counterterrorism policies in many ways.) Courts feel these pressures, and those pressures will be significantly heightened, and any countervailing tendency to guard against executive overreaction diminished, if courts are widely seen to be responsible for an actual terrorist attack. More broadly, the usual security panic after a bad attack will be enhanced quite a lot—in courts and in Congress—if before the attack legal and judicial constraints are seen to block safety. If Trump assumes that there will be a bad terrorist attack on his watch, blaming judges now will deflect blame and enhance his power more than usual after the next attack.5 One might add that Trump’s executive order and the presidential Twitter assault on the judiciary that followed have set up the judiciary to be blamed following any attack, not just one having “any conceivable connection to immigration.” In his followers’ view Trump has acted to protect the country and “political” judges have blocked him. He has put them in a position to take the fall. Perhaps this was not the original plan but with Trump, it is safe to say, there will likely never be an original plan that plays out to the end. As the hapless Jeb Bush observed, Trump was “a chaos candidate and he’d be a chaos president.” Better to say that Trump uses chaos as a vital element in his tactics, perhaps having learned during his long career to capitalize on the chaos that his recklessness, ignorance, and aggression inevitably create. ((ul))One might call the((/ul)) resulting ((ul))tactics “shock and opportunity”: Trump uses chaos to shock his opponents into varying crouches of outrage and contempt and then lunges forward amid the tumult wherever he sees an opportunity presenting itself.((/ul)) No wonder he thinks of himself as the supreme “counter-puncher.” His virtuosity is in his opportunism. ((ul))It is against this reality that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))we must see ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))likelihood of a crisis as the ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))vital ((/ul))((ul))((hl))springboard of a Trump presidency, ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))especially an increasingly shaky, unpopular, and unstable one((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). ((/ul))((ul))((hl))The lower his poll numbers((/hl))((/ul)), the more outlandish his lies, the greater the resistance from opponents within the bureaucracies, the thicker his scandals and chaos, ((ul))((hl))the likelier he will be to seek to use a crisis((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) and all the opportunities it offers to lever himself from a position of defensiveness to that of dominating power((/ul)). It is impossible to say when ((ul))such a crisis might((/ul)) present itself or what it might ((ul))be((/ul)): A confrontation with Iran in the Persian Gulf? ((ul))((hl))A dust-up with China over its claimed possessions in the South China Sea((/hl))((/ul))((ul))?((/ul)) A terrorist attack on American soil? There is no way of predicting, but ((ul))it ((/ul))((ul))((hl))is worth taking very seriously((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) that some sort of crisis will come((/ul)) and that, given Trump’s past behavior, his ruthless opportunism, and his drumbeat emphasis on “protecting the country,” such a crisis might well serve as a turning point in a Trump presidency, particularly one that is increasingly under siege. Consider the possibility of a terrorist attack on American soil, even a failed one. Not only would such an attack, as noted, put Trump in a perfect position to strike out at the judiciary, a major countervailing institution, it would offer him the political leverage to put down various rebellions within the bureaucracy, particularly within the intelligence agencies. There is no way to know whether such an attack will come but one can say that Trump, by attempting to strike out at Muslims generally, as he had vowed to do, has managed to place the Islamic State in the tempting position of being able to affirm, by attacking the United States, that it is the avenger of all Muslims. No accident that its propagandists have been nothing short of exultant, dubbing Trump’s executive order “the blessed order” and thus raising it to the level of the United States’ “blessed invasion” of Iraq as a miracle savior of its cause. If, as the Islamic State has asserted, the goal of its attacks in the West has been to “eliminate the gray zone”—to place “Muslims in the West…between one of two choices,” to either “apostatize or [migrate] to the Islamic State, and thereby escape persecution from the Crusader government and citizens”6—then Trump’s immigration ban goes far toward accomplishing the same thing: isolating Islamic communities, placing them all among a besieged minority whose travel is restricted and whose loyalty to their adopted countries is put in question. Already several jihadist tweeters asserted that the prophecy of the late Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born cleric killed in a drone attack in Yemen in 2011, that the “West would eventually turn against its Muslim citizens,” had been fulfilled.7 If one sought to design a policy to encourage radicalization, it would be hard to suggest a better one. One needn’t posit an administration master plan to notice that a further attack, even an unsuccessful one, will find the political ground well prepared. The panic over security that follows will open the way to a variety of measures to “protect the country,” few or none of which might have been necessary to prevent the attack in the first place. As we have seen, after an attack politicians seize the opportunity to act, not least to deflect blame from themselves, and we can expect President Donald (“The hour of action has arrived!”) Trump, after his repeated vows to keep the country safe, to act aggressively and comprehensively. How far he might go would depend on the severity of an attack, the ambitions of the administration, and perhaps how cornered the president feels himself to be. What measures might we expect under a Trump state of emergency? Probably strong steps against refugees, aliens, and immigrants. Suspending all entry of refugees. Widespread deportations. Expelling many green card holders. Further tightening and even suspending immigration. Mosques might be placed under surveillance, the much-discussed Muslim registry established. More broadly, and again depending on the severity of an attack, bulk collection of metadata might be reinstituted along with other forms of domestic surveillance. Long-standing constraints on the military and the CIA operating domestically might be loosened or eliminated. Black sites would be reestablished and torture reintroduced. The cells at Guantánamo, nearly empty now, would once again begin to fill. The standing post–September 11 Authorization for the Use of Military Force might be expanded or replaced, allowing unlimited military strikes abroad—and, perhaps, at home. The latter might lead, in the case of a particularly severe attack, to the suspension of habeas corpus. Certainly if such an attack were to come during the current Congress there is no reason to expect anything other than majority cooperation and support, not only for Trump’s specific responses to the attack but for the rest of his program. Democrats, whom Trump would denounce as worse than judges in their obstructionism, would be on the defensive. And the courts, whose pushback in any case would take much longer—as it did after September 11—will have been politically hamstrung by a commander in chief who will be in a position to declare, and to repeat, that he had warned the “political judges” not to second-guess him in what was needed to protect the country but that they had not listened.

Then there is the subject that touches every American — the economy — and Trump is doing so well on that front that even the New York Times had to admit it “ran out of words to describe how good the job numbers are.” Since Trump took office, nearly 3 million jobs have been created, and wage growth is at the highest point since President Bush left office. Unemployment has dipped to its lowest level since 2000 and to record lows for African Americans and Asians. Manufacturing jobs are increasingacross the country, and two-thirds of Americans say the economy is “good.” On top of that, efforts by Obama supporters to give their man credit for the economic numbers have crumbled in recent months. Republican congressional candidates are right to worry whether Trump’s coattails and loyal supporters are enough to keep them in control of Congress beyond this year. The Senate seems safe for now. But the battle for control of the House remains a toss-up, Democrats continue to hold a small-but-stubborn lead in the generic ballot question, and there is no guarantee, particularly as political turmoil in Italy threatens the European Union economy, the economy still will be a political plus come November.

Way back in ... 2015((/ul))? For more than a decade — ever since the Bush administration failed to pass comprehensive immigration reform in 2006 and 2007 — conventional wisdom has said that Congress can’t pass immigration bills because of the “amnesty” problem. Any proposal to legalize some or all of the 11 million unauthorized immigrants living in the US would be toxic to many Republicans; any proposal without any legalization would be toxic to many Democrats. Rahm Emanuel, who was chief of staff in the early years of the Obama White House, famously said that “immigration is the third rail of politics,” but he meant unauthorized immigration (or rather, what to do about unauthorized immigrants). Legal immigration was a tricky policy issue that business and labor fought over, but it wasn’t going to cost any votes on the Senate floor or in elections. That era is over. ((ul))In the midst of a messy Senate debate over immigration policy, it’s now clear that the most contentious question in Congress is one that’s been dormant in legislative fights for years: whether or not to cut legal immigration. This is almost entirely the doing of ((/ul))President Donald ((ul))Trump((/ul)). Over the course of two and a half years, as a candidate, nominee, and now president, ((ul))he’s turned a fringe right-wing view into the heart of the current congressional debate over immigration.

((/ul))Donald Trump singlehandedly changed the Republican Party’s position on legal immigration ((ul))The key insight of((/ul)) Donald ((ul))Trump’s short political career — the one that allowed him to rocket to the top of the primary polls((/ul)) soon after he launched his campaign in June 2015 — ((ul))was that a segment of ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the Republican base was hungry for a candidate that was willing to speak harshly((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) not just ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))about((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) unauthorized immigration, but ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))immigration itself((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). ((/ul))Trump wasn’t the only person in the Republican field talking about immigration. Nor was he the only person running as an immigration hawk. But while other Republicans went to pains rhetorically to emphasize that legal immigration was good and important and part of the American dream, Trump didn’t bother. His descriptions of Mexico “sending” over bad people could be interpreted as illegal border-crossers or immigration generally, depending on what listeners wanted to hear. ((ul))He depicted would-be legal refugees as ISIS moles.((/ul)) ((ul))From his first proposal of a “Muslim ban((/ul))” in December 2015 to his responses to terror attacks in fall 2017, ((ul))he has taken the stance that the only way to prevent terrorists from entering the US is to block the paths that individual terrorists have taken to immigrate here in the past — shutting the door behind them and ((/ul))((ul))locking out tens of thousands of immigrants per year((/ul))((ul)), or more.

At this point, that's old news.

I looked through their data, did some math, and came up with four different charts that demonstrate some of the most important facts about Trump's approval rating. Before getting started, I have one quick note for readers who might be confused because they have personal experience either making or filling out very non-political polls on SurveyMonkey. This is that same SurveyMonkey ? the company just also usse its platform to conduct scientific political surveys. Mark Blumenthal, head of election polling, explained it to me: \"We draw random samples of those who have just completed a survey on our platform and invite them to answer a few more questions about important issues and current events, including Trump approval\" and then they \"statistically adjust the data so it is representative of the American public.\" So here are the graphics and the explanations: There Aren't (And Never Have Been) Many Lukewarm Trump Disapprovers The conventional wisdom on politics is often wrong. But these polls show that it's right about one thing ? Americans who don't like Trump really don't like him. This graphic shows the percentage of Trump disapprovers who \"strongly\" or \"somewhat\" disapprove of Trump's job performance in a series of SurveyMonkey polls stretching from January 2017 to now. The top line tells most of the story. If you put every American who disapproves of Trump in a room (usually more than half of the people that SurveyMonkey polls) and picked someone randomly, the odds of picking a \"strong disapprover\" would be greater than 3-to-1. This is a problem for down-ballot Republicans. Democrats have won some high profile races (like the special election in Pennsylvania's 18th District) partially by riding strong anti-Trump sentiment. The president has motived Democrats to turn out at a high rate while driving some more typical GOP voters to cast their ballot for the blue team. That anti-Trump enthusiasm is part of the reason Democrats are currently the favorites to take the House in November. ((ul))Trump's Base is More Divided Than Many Think ((/ul))The conventional wisdom is a little less helpful when it comes to Trump supporters.

He has hurled insults at governors, senators, a judge who recently ruled against him and Miss Universe 2014. He has also attacked the press, arguing that as president he will “open up” libel laws so he can sue newspapers that publish “purposely negative and horrible and false articles” about him. Mr. Trump’s critics wonder whether a man with such a violent temper can be trusted with the presidency. ((ul))But his defenders, like Senator John McCain and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, assure us that the Constitution will constrain him((/ul)). “I still believe we have the institutions of government that would restrain someone who seeks to exceed their constitutional obligations,” Mr. McCain told The New York Times. “We have a Congress. We have the Supreme Court. We’re not Romania.” Under the principle of separation of powers, the president shares power with Congress and the judiciary. The party system, the press and American political traditions may constrain him as well. But what would this mean in practice if Mr. Trump wins? It depends on what Mr. Trump wants to do. His signature issues are immigration and trade. He could not build the Mexican wall without congressional support. Bu((ul))t ((/ul))((ul))((hl))he could order immigration authorities to deport unauthorized immigrants. And he could bar Muslims from entering the country under existing law, which authorizes him to bar classes of aliens whose entry he determines “would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.”((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) It wouldn’t be the first time: President Ronald Reagan cited this law, as well as his inherent constitutional powers, to block a flood of Haitian migrants from pouring into United States territory in 1981((/ul)). Can he slap tariffs on China, as he has threatened? Yes, he can. ((ul))Congress has delegated to the president the power to retaliate against foreign countries that engage in unfair trade practices like dumping, leaving it to the president and trade officials to determine what that means. In 2002, President George W. Bush imposed steel tariffs on China and other countries for what many observers considered political reasons.((/ul)) The World Trade Organization ruled the steel tariffs illegal in that case. But ((ul))Mr. Trump could simply ignore its judgment, and indeed withdraw the United States from the W.T.O., just as President Bush withdrew the United States from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty in 2002((/ul)). While he’s at it, Mr((ul)). Trump could tear up the North Atlantic Treaty, which created NATO, an organization that he has called “obsolete.”((/ul)) In May, Mr. ((ul))Trump vowed to rescind President Obama’s environmental policies. He would be able to do that as well. He could disavow the Paris climate change agreement, just as President Bush “unsigned” a treaty creating an international criminal court in 2002. He could choke off climate regulations that are in development and probably withdraw existing climate regulations. Even if a court blocked him, he could refuse to enforce the regulations, just as Mr. Obama refused to enforce immigration laws((/ul)). In wielding executive power in these ways, Mr. ((ul))Trump would be following in the footsteps of his predecessors. President Bush cited his commander in chief powers in order to justify interrogation, surveillance and detention polices in the wake of Sept. 11.((/ul)) While Mr. ((ul))Obama((/ul)) has shied away from Mr. Bush’s constitutional arguments, ((ul))he has interpreted statutes aggressively, while also relying on constitutional authorities, to justify the military intervention in Libya in 2011 and his nonenforcement of immigration laws((/ul)). Mr. Trump has expressed impatience with his critics and hinted that he would use federal powers against them. He wouldn’t be able to put someone in jail merely for criticizing him. But ((ul))he could direct agencies to use their vast regulatory powers against the companies of executives who have displeased him, like Jeff Bezos, for example, the founder of Amazon. Mr. Trump has already hinted that he would go after Amazon for supposed antitrust violations. He could direct the Department of Justice to investigate his critics by prioritizing categories of crimes they may have committed. Political opponents could be accused of campaign finance law violations. Former government officials, like Hillary Clinton, could be accused of violating secrecy laws.((/ul)) Even if the charges come to nothing, ((ul))the legal fees for defendants will be hefty((/ul)). Mr. ((ul))Trump could also crack down on journalists who report on national security issues by enforcing federal secrecy laws more aggressively than previous presidents.((/ul)) President Obama received a lot of criticism for prosecuting government employees who leaked secrets, but the Justice Department did not bring charges against the journalists who published the leaked information. What couldn’t Mr. Trump do? He couldn’t lower (or raise) taxes on his own. He’s supposed to spend funds that Congress appropriates and for the things that Congress appropriates them for — that’s what stands in the way of the wall (unless he persuades Mexico to pay for it and construct it on the other side of the border). He could not follow through on his promise to impose the death penalty on killers of police officers by executive order. And even where he does act, he needs to make sure his legal theories are in order. If he wanted to withdraw climate regulations because climate change is a hoax perpetuated by China, no court would allow him to. But if he said that the climate regulations were based on a speculative assessment of harms that wouldn’t occur for 100 years, he could succeed. Much depends on how far Mr. Trump is willing to push existing legal understandings. ((ul))There is a netherworld of laws that presidents are supposed to comply with but courts don’t enforce. He could send military forces into a foreign country without authorization from Congress; courts would most likely stay out of the dispute. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))What of his suggestion earlier this year to kill the families of terrorists? Courts typically defer to the executive on matters concerning military activities abroad((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). He might even try to withhold appropriated funds or shift them around in defiance of Congress’s wishes((/ul)). What, then, stands between us and a nearly unbounded Mr. Trump, aside from the next election? Senators McCain and McConnell say Congress, but ((ul))only a veto-proof majority in both houses, passing new laws, could stop Mr. Trump from exercising the legal authority that Congress has already given the president. Congress can threaten to withhold funds, but the president’s powers to veto legislation and appoint government officers give him a large bargaining chip((/ul)). Removal of a president by impeachment is extremely difficult; it has never happened. ((ul))The courts are another barrier, but they would need to reverse their longstanding practice of deferring to the president in matters of foreign affairs and domestic regulation((/ul)). The Supreme Court could, for example, declare an entry bar on Muslims unconstitutional. But it’s hard to predict how Mr. Trump would respond. After a federal judge, Gonzalo Curiel, ruled against him on a motion in the long-running Trump University litigation, Mr. Trump called him a “hater” and a “Mexican” (Judge Curiel is an American). Mr. Trump’s biggest obstacle to vast power is not the separation of powers but the millions of federal employees who are supposed to work for him. Most of these employees have a strong sense of professionalism and are dedicated to the mission of their agency. They don’t take kindly to arbitrary orders from above. As President Harry Truman said ahead of Dwight D. Eisenhower’s presidency: “He’ll sit here, and he’ll say, ‘Do this! Do that!’ And nothing will happen.” To make things happen, Mr. Trump will need to get loyalists into leadership positions of the agencies, but to do so, he will need the cooperation of the Senate (or he will need to aggressively exploit his recess appointment powers). Moreover, the small number of politically appointed leaders enjoy only limited control of the mass of civil servants. These employees can drag their feet, leak to the press, threaten to resign and employ other tactics to undermine Mr. Trump’s initiatives if they object to them. They’re also hard to fire, thanks to Civil Service protections. But Mr. ((ul))((hl))Trump can fight back. He can appoint loyalists not only to political positions in the executive branch, but to the courts, and he may be able to attract them to the ranks of the Civil Service((/hl))((/ul)). And while executive branch officials who disregard the law might be prosecuted by the Justice Department, President ((ul))Trump would have one more trick up his sleeve. Like President George H.W. Bush, who rescued Iran-contra defendants from punishment in 1992, he could hand out get-out-of-jail-free cards in the form of the pardon.((/ul))"],"stats":{"highlightedWords":109}},{"tag":"<<Good card>> There are no checks and balances","cite":"Freedland 17 (8/11, Jonathan, The Guardian, “Trump is the real nuclear threat, and we can’t just fantasise him away”, https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/11/trump-nuclear-threat-deep-state-fantasy-north-korea)","text":["Among the many terrifying facts that have emerged in the last several days, perhaps the scariest relate to the nuclear button over which now hovers the finger of Donald Trump.

He can be stopped by the courts, as Trump saw with his travel ban. But ((ul))if he wants to rain fire((/ul)) ((ul))and fury on a distant enemy, bringing more fire and fury down on his own citizens((/ul)) and many hundreds of millions of others, ((ul))((hl))there is no one standing in his way((/hl))((/ul)). Not for nothing does the geopolitical literature refer to the US president as the “nuclear monarch.” The more you hear of the simplicity of the system, the more frightening it becomes. ((ul))If Trump decides he has had enough of Kim Jong-un’s verbal threats((/ul)), ((ul))he merely has to turn to the low-level military aide at his side and ask them to open up the black briefcase((/ul)) that officer keeps permanently in their grasp. The bag is known as the nuclear “football”. (It gets its name from the code word for the very first set of nuclear war plans: dropkick.) Inside the bag is a menu of options, explained in detail in a “black book,” but also set out in a single, cartoon-like page for speedy comprehension. Trump has only to make his choice, pick up the phone to the Pentagon war room, utter the code words that identify him as the president and give the order. That’s it. The officer who receives the call at the Pentagon has no authority to question or challenge the order. ((ul))((hl))There is no need for consultation with anyone else((/hl))((/ul)). Not the secretary of state or the secretary of defence, nor the head of the military. ((ul))The officer who receives the call at the Pentagon has no authority to question or challenge the order((/ul)). His or her duty is only to implement it. ((ul))Thirty minutes after the president gave the instruction, the nuclear missiles would be hitting their targets. ((/ul))((ul))There is no way of turning them back((/ul)). ((ul))Such power in the hands of a single individual would be a horrifying prospect ((/ul))((ul))even if it were Solomon himself((/ul))((ul)) whose finger was on the trigger((/ul)). But as Bruce Blair, a former nuclear missile launch officer, and seasoned military analyst wrote during the 2016 campaign, ((ul))((hl))Trump’s “((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))quick temper((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)), defensiveness bordering on ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))paranoia((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) and disdain for anyone who criticises him do not inspire deep confidence in his prudence((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).”((/hl)) What’s more, Trump is the man who said in 2015, “For me, nuclear is just the power, the devastation is very important to me,” and who bellowed from the campaign podium, “I love war”. In last year’s election campaign, the former Republican congressman Joe Scarborough reported on a briefing a foreign policy expert had given Trump. “Three times, he asked, at one point, ‘If we have them, we can’t we use them?’ … Three times, in an hour briefing, ‘Why can’t we use nuclear weapons?’” It turns out Hillary Clinton was right to warn Americans 14 months ago that, “It’s not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin.” And here we are, Trump tweet-goading the North Koreans by declaring military solutions “locked and loaded”. We need imagine no longer. ((ul))Those who find themselves trembling at all this have spent the last few days grasping for a comfort blanket((/ul)). ((ul))A favourite has been the notion that those around Trump, especially the generals current and former, will not let him unleash nuclear Armageddon((/ul)). ((ul))This view holds that, yes, Trump may well be dangerously unhinged but fear not, the wiser heads of Washington will stay his hand((/ul)). Indeed, this strain of thinking has been visible since Trump took the oath of office. Call it the deep state fantasy. It looks to the national security apparatus, the intelligence agencies and the permanent bureaucracy, the shadow government, to step in and do the right thing. ((ul))It hangs its hopes on a range of prospective saviours((/ul)). It might be the trio of former generals made up of Jim Mattis, who heads the Pentagon, John Kelly, recently drafted in as chief of staff, and HR McMaster who serves as national security adviser. Alternatively, it looks to the loose alliance hailed this week by the influential Axios website as “The Committee to Save America”, consisting not only of the generals but also the cluster of New Yorkers that includes some of Trump’s less hot-headed economic advisers, with added reinforcements from the Republican ranks in Congress. The committee’s unofficial mission: to protect “the nation from disaster”. The ultimate deep state fantasy longs for the men in the shadows not merely to restrain Trump, but remove him from office. The designated hero of this story is Robert Mueller, the former FBI director now heading what is reported to be a swift and penetrating probe into allegations of collusion with Russia as well as Trump’s wider business dealings. Mueller’s role may indeed prove to be critical. But ((ul))the deep state fantasy itself((/ul)), while comforting, ((ul))is surely a ((/ul))((ul))dead end for Trump’s opponents((/ul)). For one thing, ((ul))events have reached an odd pass when liberals are dreaming of unelected generals thwarting an elected head of government: that used to be the fantasy of the militaristic right((/ul)). But ((ul))it also relies more on hope than evidence((/ul)). ((ul))All these supposedly wise heads around Trump: ((/ul))((ul))what restraint have they achieved so far?((/ul)) ((ul))Kelly was meant to impose order and discipline((/ul)), and ((ul))yet we still have Trump tweeting threats that could ((/ul))((ul))easily be misinterpreted((/ul))((ul)) as the cue for war((/ul)). ((ul))On North Korea, the US administration continues to send conflicting signals by the hour((/ul)), ((ul))with Trump outriders like Sebastian Gorka slapping down secretary of state Rex Tillerson((/ul)) on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Friday, creating confusion when a nuclear standoff requires calm clarity. And we cannot escape the basic fact. ((ul))((hl))All these advisers can try to hold him back, but when it comes to it, nuclear authority is ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))Trump’s and Trump’s alone((/hl))((/ul)). He is the nuclear monarch.

((ul))Ultimately it will be up to the men and women of Congress to do their constitutional duty by ((/ul))((ul))impeaching Trump((/ul)) and removing him from office.

Understanding evangelicals’ broader perspective on immigration can also help illuminate why this group continues to support Trump so strongly — despite recent scandals that appear to fly in the face of evangelicals’ values.1 First, ((ul))polling on white evangelical Protestants has shown that((/ul)) ((ul))((hl))they’re more likely than ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))any other religious group((/hl))((/ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((ul))((hl))to support ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))hardline immigration policies((/hl))((/ul)) and to have negative views of immigrants overall.

Another Pew survey, conducted last year, found ((ul))that while majorities of nearly every religious group agree that immigrants strengthen our country, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))white evangelical Protestants are((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))more divided((/ul)), ((ul))with a plurality((/ul)) (44 percent) ((ul))((hl))saying that immigrants are a burden((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). ((/ul))These findings line up with results from other surveys too, like a 2017 poll from the Public Religion Research Institute that found that white evangelical Protestants were the only religious group in which a majority (57 percent) said they’re bothered when they encounter immigrants who don’t speak English. They were also the likeliest to say that they have little or nothing in common with immigrants. Daniel Cox, the research director at PRRI,2 said these findings help explain why ((ul))((hl))evangelicals((/hl))((/ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((ul))((hl))aren’t likely to abandon Trump((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) over the child separation crisis((/ul)), ((ul))even if they’re troubled by it((/ul)). “More than other groups, ((ul))((hl))white evangelical Protestants seem to perceive immigrants as a ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))threat to American society((/hl))((/ul)),” he said. “So ((ul))((hl))even if they don’t like this particular policy((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), ((/ul))((ul))((hl))they’re on board with Trump’s approach to immigration in general((/hl))((/ul)), ((ul))and that makes it likelier that they’ll see this as a ((/ul))((ul))tactical misstep((/ul))((ul)) rather than a ((/ul))((ul))breaking point((/ul)).” That’s also how some evangelical leaders have responded; for example, Jentezen Franklin, a Georgia megachurch pastor who serves on Trump’s evangelical advisory council, criticized the family separation policy in an interview with FiveThirtyEight but blamed Congress — rather than Trump — for failing to act. “The president really cares for these families, but to permanently fix the problem, he needs Congress to do their job and work with him on border security,” Franklin said, adding that many evangelicals were drawn to Trump because of his emphasis on reducing the number of undocumented immigrants in the U.S."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":91}},{"tag":"The base doesn’t really care","cite":"Dylan Matthews 6/18/18, Vox politics correspondent, \"Polls: Trump’s family separation policy is very unpopular — except among Republicans\", Vox, https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/6/18/17475740/family-separation-poll-polling-border-trump-children-immigrant-families-parents","text":["Two new ((ul))polls find that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the US government policy of separating children from their parents((/hl))((/ul)) at the Mexican border ((ul))((hl))is((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) very ((/ul))((ul))((hl))unpopular((/hl))((/ul)) with the general public ((ul))((hl))but((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) retains majority support among Republicans((/hl))((/ul)). A new Quinnipiac University poll, released Monday, asked voters, “As you may know, some families seeking asylum from their home country cross the U.S. border illegally and then request asylum. In an attempt to discourage this, the Trump administration has been prosecuting the parents immediately, which means separating parents from their children. Do you support or oppose this policy?” As my colleague Dara Lind notes, this characterizes most of the reason for family separation, though some families seeking asylum legally at ports of entry have also been separated. Sixty-six percent of voters — including ((ul))91 percent of Democrats((/ul)) and 68 percent of independents — ((ul))told Quinnipiac they opposed the policy((/ul)).

Ipsos asked respondents if they agreed with this statement: “It is appropriate to separate undocumented immigrant parents from their children when they cross the border in order to discourage others from crossing the border illegally.” The wording is slightly different from the Quinnipiac poll, foregrounding the deterrence rationale the Trump administration has used to defend the policy. Fifty-five percent of respondents stated they disagreed (42 percent “strongly” disagreed), while 27 percent agreed. As in the Quinnipiac poll, women and nonwhite people were likelier to disagree with the policy; unlike the Quinnipiac poll, differences based on education were minimal, and 18- to 34-year-olds and 35- to 54-year-olds had similar opinions. (People 55 and up were likelier to support the policy.) And as in the Quinnipiac poll, ((ul))more Republicans approved of the policy than not((/ul)) (46 percent to 32 percent). Note that unlike the Quinnipiac poll, the Ipsos poll found only a plurality of Republicans supporting family separation, not a majority. Chris Warshaw, a political scientist at George Washington University, notes that both the Quinnipiac and Ipsos polling suggests the policy is less popular than any major policy proposal of recent American history, including the extremely unpopular Obamacare repeal bills of last summer: [tweet omitted] Nonetheless, the polls find that ((ul))((hl))Trump’s((/hl))((/ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((ul))((hl))core Republican base supports family separation((/hl))((/ul)). But when interpreting party-based polling, one should keep in mind the finding by Emory political scientists Pablo Montagnes, Zachary Peskowitz, and Joshua McCrain that Trump’s unpopularity has coincided with fewer people identifying as Republicans. That could mean that Republicans who disagree with Trump, and in particular his immigration policies, are likelier to identify as independents rather than Republicans now, which in turn artificially inflates support for Trump among self-identified Republicans.

((ul))But the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))back of the Trump base is not likely to break any time soon, because Trump’s supporters aren’t beholden to politics or logic((/hl))((/ul))((hl)). ((/hl))((ul))Instead, they are creatures of a group psychology dynamic more commonly seen in religious and fraternal organizations. In the “communion mode” authority structure((/ul))((ul)),((/ul)) described by Andrew Gray, ((ul))((hl))people's recognition of legitimate authority is \"based on an appeal to common values and creeds((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).\"((/ul)) \"In this mode,\" added Gray, \"((ul))the legitimacy for actions lies in consistency with the understandings, protocols, and guiding values of shared frames of reference.((/ul))” Compare that to the contractual mode, which is based an agreement that sets out obligations and rewards, or “command mode,” which Gray said, \"is based on the rule of law emanating from a sovereign body and delivered through a scalar chain of superior and subordinate authority.\" Communion governance structures rely on regular in-person meetings, call and response rituals (witness the continued usefulness of \"Lock her up!\" chants at Trump rallies, despite Hillary Clinton's 2016 loss) and faith in shared values and experiences. ((ul))Groups built around communion authority are tightly connected and very strong in part because, ((/ul))((ul))research shows((/ul))((ul)), they display “homophily and parochialism directed to those outside the group.”((/ul)) (That is a scholarly way of saying that those in communion groups tend to associate and bond with people that are similar to themselves and view those who are not with suspicion and hostility.) When Trump said he was going to build the wall, he was reflecting a shared value of opposition to immigration, or anti-Hispanic bias or frustration with paralysis on immigration policy (or all three). Significantly, researchers have also found thatreligious communion authority followers make contributions as a show of their values rather than to affect any consequence((hl)).((/hl))((hl)) ((/hl))((ul))((hl))That’s key to understanding Trump’s base because it means that contributions to the cause — whether money, posting on social media or voting — were unlikely to be influenced by whether Trump could actually deliver on his promises((/hl))((/ul)). And it explains why political arguments about whether the wall will really get built (Trump has admitted that it doesn't need to be a full scale wall), whether Mexico is going to pay for it (they won't, and Trump knows it) or whether he's brought coal jobs back (he didn't) did not, do not and will not matter to Trump supporters. Even though Trump promised a wall for which Mexico would pay and coal jobs, among other broken promises, his supporters did not invest in his campaign to get those specific things. ((ul))When Trump said he was going to build that wall, he was reflecting a shared value of opposition to immigration, or anti-Hispanic bias or frustration with paralysis on immigration policy (or all three((/ul))((ul)))((/ul)). To those in this communion structure, Trump’s seriousness about their shared values — that he believes them too — is all that matters. Moreover, according to philanthropy experts, for those in communion structures, a belief that the group’s values are under threat or assault by larger, stronger forces dramatically increases followers' commitment. Therefore, ((ul))((hl))the act of critics pointing out Trump’s failures could strengthen his standing if drawing attention to those failures are seen as persecution by outside forces((/hl))((/ul)) (such as a “deep state” or a “fake news media”). Perhaps most importantly, as communion followers, ((ul))((hl))those in the Trump base are likely to see attacks on him as attacks on them personally((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), because they recognize Trump as a values leader, not a political one.((/ul)) ((ul))Opposition to him is opposition to those values — their values((/ul)). So, when reporters ask, “Do you still support Trump?” they hear, “Do you still support your own values?” Research supports that the bonds between communion group members are stronger than those between followers and a leader((hl)).((/hl)) It is important, therefore, to view Trump as distinct from the values of the group. A leader may be transitional, but the values tend to be more rigid. ((ul))Therefore, inroads to Trump’s base are more likely to be successful if they avoid the values or symbols of the supporters, and find ways to target Trump for betraying them((/ul)). ((ul))They recognize his legitimacy and follow him not because of who he is or what he does, but because of what they think he believes((/ul)) — and what they think that says about them. Because the values outweigh the leaders, when communion followers no longer see their values reflected by a communion leader, they become receptive to finding a new one. Since people's acceptance of communion authority relies on consistency with shared values, demonstrating that Trump no longer does (or never did) share the values of his followers in faith, not practice would be pivotal. Similarly, the emergence of other leaders that more passionately reflect shared values would cleave Trump from his base. If, for example, someone stepped forward to say Trump is not hard enough on immigrants, terrorists or trade, that person might pull supporters away from Trump and into their orbit. Still, owing to the group’s insularity and resistance to outside criticism, any values-based replacements for Trump must come from within the structure, not outside. To work, the followers must believe the leader believes in the shared value more than Trump. And even under such scenario, it’s unlikely that such a replacement leader could take over the Trump base as much as fragment it. No further treks to Trump Country are needed to understand why Trump’s base remains unshaken.

He won college-educated white voters by a four-point margin over Hillary Clinton, according to exit polls. But his real victory was among members of the white working class: Twice as many of these voters cast their ballots for the president as for Clinton. In the wake of Trump’s surprise win, some journalists, scholars, and political strategists argued that economic anxiety drove these Americans to Trump. But new analysis of post-election survey data conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute and The Atlantic found something different: ((ul))Evidence suggests financially troubled voters in the white working class were more likely to prefer Clinton over Trump.((/ul)) Besides partisan affiliation, ((ul))((hl))it was cultural anxiety((/hl))((/ul))—feeling like a stranger in America, ((ul))((hl))supporting the deportation of immigrants((/hl))((/ul))((ul)),((/ul)) and hesitating about educational investment—((ul))that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))best predicted support for Trump((/hl))((/ul)). This data adds to the public’s mosaic-like understanding of the 2016 election. It suggests Trump’s most powerful message, at least among some Americans, was about defending the country’s putative culture. Because this message seems to have resonated so deeply with voters, Trump’s policies, speeches, and eventual reelection may depend on their perception of how well he fulfills it. In September and October 2016, PRRI and The Atlantic surveyed American voters about how they were feeling about politics. Researchers specifically focused on white, working-class voters—people without college degrees or salaried jobs. This group accounts for one-third of American adults. They make up a bigger share of the population in the Midwest than they do in any other region, and more than half of rural Americans are part of the white working class. As it turned out, this would become one of the most decisive groups of voters in the election. In November, researchers returned to this group to see how its members had voted and get a sense of why. They found that 64 percent of these voters had chosen Trump, while only 32 percent chose Clinton. While white, non-college-educated voters tend to prefer Republicans, Trump won them by a larger margin than any presidential candidate since 1980, according to the Pew Research Center. Partisan identification strongly predicted how white, working-class people would vote. Self-described Republicans were 11 times more likely than their non-Republican peers to choose Trump. Researchers found that partisanship is most pronounced among the young: Among white working-class Americans under 30, 57 percent identified as Republican or Republican-leaning, compared to 29 percent who identified as Democratic or Democratic-leaning. By comparison, only slightly more than half of seniors 65 and over were Republicans or Republican-leaning, compared to over one-third who were Democrats or Democratic-leaning. It may not be surprising that Republicans vote Republican. But the analysis also isolated a handful of other factors that drove white working-class voters—ones that defy post-election tropes. Controlling for other demographic variables, three ((ul))((hl))factors stood out as strong independent predictors of how white working-class people would vote((/hl))((/ul))((hl)). ((/hl))((ul))((hl))The first was anxiety about cultural change. Sixty-eight percent of white working-class voters said the American way of life needs to be protected from foreign influence((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). ((/ul))And nearly half agreed with the statement, “things have changed so much that I often feel like a stranger in my own country.” Together, these variables were strong indictors of support for Trump: ((ul))((hl))79 percent of white working-class voters who had these anxieties chose Trump((/hl))((/ul)), while only 43 percent of white working-class voters who did not share one or both of these fears cast their vote the same way. ((ul))The second factor was immigration.((/ul)) Contrary to popular narratives, only a small portion—just ((ul))27 percent—of white working-class voters said they favor a policy of identifying and deporting immigrants who are in the country illegally((/ul)). ((ul))Among the people who did share this belief, Trump was wildly popular: 87 percent of them supported the president in the 2016 election((/ul)). Finally, 54 percent of white working-class Americans said investing in college education is a risky gamble, including 61 percent of white working-class men. White working-class voters who held this belief were almost twice as likely as their peers to support Trump. “The enduring narrative of the American dream is that if you study and get a college education and work hard, you can get ahead,” said Robert P. Jones, the CEO of PRRI. “The survey shows that many white working-class Americans, especially men, no longer see that path available to them. … It is this sense of economic fatalism, more than just economic hardship, that was the decisive factor in support for Trump among white working-class voters.” While the analysis pointed to some interesting patterns around economic status, more research is needed to confirm them. The findings contrast with much of the coverage of the election: People who said their finances are only in fair or poor shape were nearly twice as likely to support Clinton compared to those who feel more economically secure. Although demographic factors like gender, age, geographic region, and religion weren’t statistically significant predictors of who voted for Trump, some of the other information gathered in the survey offers a portrait of how white working-class Americans feel about their status in the world. Nearly two-thirds of the white working class say American culture has gotten worse since the 1950s. Sixty-eight percent say the U.S. is in danger of losing its identity, and ((ul))((hl))62 percent say America’s growing number of immigrants threaten the country’s culture((/hl))((/ul)). More than half say discrimination against whites has become just as problematic as discrimination against minorities. This analysis provides only a surface look at the concerns and anxieties of America’s white working class. ((ul))((hl))Polling((/hl))((/ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((ul))((hl))is((/hl))((/ul)) a notoriously clumsy instrument for understanding people’s lives, and provides only a sketch of who they are. But it’s ((ul))((hl))useful for debunking myths and narratives—particularly the ubiquitous idea that economic anxiety drove white working-class voters to support Trump.((/hl))((/ul)) When these voters hear messages from their president, they’re listening with ears attuned to cultural change and anxiety about America’s multicultural future. It would be a mistake to use this insight to create yet another caricature of the Trump voter. But perhaps it will complicate the stereotypes about destitute factory landscapes and poor folks who had nowhere to turn but right."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":99}},{"tag":"Econ doesn’t thump – Immigration is the key voting issue for Republicans ","cite":"Caspani 7/5","text":["(Maria Caspani is a digital editor at Reuters News Agency.

Bush. The president has come under harsh criticism since Monday’s summit with the Russian leader. In the post-meeting press conference, Trump appeared to endorse Putin’s denial of Russian election meddling over the conclusions of U.S. intelligence agencies. On Tuesday, Trump said he misspoke. ((ul))Fagen told CNBC that while there has been very strong ((/ul))((ul))((hl))criticism from Republican senators, it has been from those who have been critical of the president((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) “We need to see the full body of the Senate, particularly, and some leaders in the House, they would need to be much more critical, and the language they use would need to be stronger,” she said on “Power Lunch” Tuesday. Plus, one or two very senior White House officials would need to resign for his base to be swayed, added Fagen, a CNBC contributor. In responding to the widespread criticism on Tuesday, Trump said, \"I accept our intelligence community's conclusion that Russia's meddling in the 2016 election took place.\" He then added: \"Could be other people also. A lot of people out there. But there was no collusion.\" The president said he misspoke in Monday’s press conference. \"My people came to me, [Director of National Intelligence] Dan Coates came to me and some others, they said they think it's Russia.

For many of Donald Trump’s normally sycophantic surrogates, this sorry spectacle was a gaffe too far. It was one thing for Trump to defend neo-Nazis, or psychologically torture masses of migrant children, or demand the FBI comport itself as his personal detective agency. But to stand beside an avowed opponent of U.S. hegemony — and apologize for America? “Disgusting,” declared Fox Business anchor Neil Cavuto. “The most serious mistake of his presidency,” Newt Gingrich declared. The Senate’s nominally anti-Trump Republicans turned their empty rhetorical denunciations up to 11. Even die-hard Trumpists like Tom Cotton felt compelled to offer implicit criticism. For once, conservative elites had certified that mainstream outrage at Trump’s conduct was not, in fact, “fake news.” ((ul))This raised the possibility that the president’s bizarre performance in Helsinki might actually change public opinion, and with it, the terrain of the battle for House control. As ((/ul))((ul))RealClearPolitics’ Sean Trende((/ul))((ul)) noted, if Trump’s approval dipped back below 40 percent — where it had been through much of the fall — precedent would predict a Democratic “wave” this November. But that doesn’t appear to be happening. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Trump’s job approval has not ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))dropped significantly((/hl))((/ul)) in the first surveys taken since the Helsinki summit. And two polls released Thursday explain why: While a large majority of Democrats and independents disapproved of Trump’s performance, ((ul))most Republican ((/ul))((ul))((hl))voters now believe that it’s actually ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))cool and ((/ul))((ul))((hl))good for an American president to say he trusts a former KGB agent ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))more than the FBI.((/ul)) An Axios/SurveyMonkey poll finds that 79 percent of Republicans approved of Trump’s handling of the summit, while 91 percent of Democrats and 62 percent of independents disagreed. In total, ((ul))that puts overall disapproval at 58 percent, and approval at 40((/ul)). A CBS News survey, meanwhile, produces largely similar results (for whatever reason, a lot more respondents chose “I don’t know” in the network’s survey than did in Axios’s): ((ul))68 percent of Republicans told the network that Trump did a good job in Helsinki((/ul)), 83 percent of Democrats and 53 percent of independents said he did a bad one. These are not good poll numbers. In 2016, Trump scraped together an Electoral College victory on the strength of 80,000 well-placed votes. Since then, his approval rating has plummeted across the Rust Belt.Now, at a time of historically low unemployment, a majority of voters disapprove of Trump’s job performance in the states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Ohio. In this context, ((ul))the fact that((/ul)) ((ul))((hl))the president is retaining most of his base((/hl))((/ul)) — while alienating most independent voters — is not good news for his reelection prospects.

After Trump did three-quarters of an about-face on Putin — claiming, absurdly, that he had intended to say the opposite of what he’d actually said about Russian involvement in the 2016 election — Republican lawmakers rallied back to his side.

Over the past month, ((ul))each piece of this scenario has begun to seem a tad more likely — except, that is, for the “doesn’t get us all killed” bit. ((/ul))Of course, Donald Trump is (almost certainly) not going to literally end all human life. But in recent weeks((ul)), many of the downside risks of his election — a mass-casualty war, irreparable diplomatic blunder, or constitutional crisis — ((/ul))((ul))have become more plausible than ever before((/ul)). Assuming we avoid total catastrophe, America is poised to make a speedy recovery from its ill-advised experiment with kakistocracy. But there are (at least) four reasons why that assumption has never been less safe: ((ul))((hl))1) The “adults” in the West Wing have never had less influence over the president((/hl))((/ul)). The most harrowing development in presidential politics over the past month (the one that exacerbates all of the others) is that Donald ((ul))Trump finally lost his humility((/ul)). That may sound absurd, like saying Trump “finally” lost his tail, or some other appendage that the president was clearly born without, or else separated from in early childhood. But the reality is that, ((ul))until recently, Trump approached his duties with a modicum of modesty((/ul)). Awed by the awesome responsibilities of his new office, ((ul))Trump spent much of last year deferring to the expertise of his advisers. He let the Republican Establishment dictate his legislative agenda and most of his Cabinet, and allowed the putative “adults” in the West Wing to overrule his instincts on the Iran deal, trade policy, and a variety of other matters((/ul)). Of course, this forbearance was never strong enough to prevent the man from firing off incendiary tweets, praising white nationalists, canceling climate deals, or obstructing a little justice. But it was, nevertheless, sufficient to prevent Trump from translating his most belligerent rhetoric about foreign policy and the Mueller investigation into action. Now, however, ((ul))Trump has finally shaken off his first-year jitters — and is ready to appoint himself the “adult” in every room((/ul)). As the New York Times reports: ((ul))((hl))A dozen people close to Mr. Trump or the White House, including current((/hl))((/ul)) and ((ul))((hl))former((/hl))((/ul)) aides and longtime friends, ((ul))((hl))described him as newly emboldened((/hl))((/ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((ul))((hl))to say what he really feels and to ignore the cautions of those around him((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). ((/ul))… [I]n his first year in the White House, according to his friends, he found himself feeling tentative and anxious, intimidated by the role of president, a fact that he never openly admitted but that they could sense, people close to the president said … They say Mr. Trump now feels he doesn’t need the expertise of Mr. Kelly, Mr. Cohn or Rex W. Tillerson, the former Exxon Mobil executive he made secretary of state. ((ul))If he once suspected they were smarter or better equipped to lead the country and protect his presidency, he doesn’t believe that now. The president’s new mind-set is readily apparent((/ul)). Over the past two weeks, ((ul))Trump has unilaterally announced steep tariffs((/ul)) on steel and aluminum imports to the United States; ((ul))ousted the “globalist” director of his National Economic Council((/ul)); agreed to an unprecedented face-to-face meeting with the leader of North Korea; ((ul))fired his secretary of State((/ul)) over Twitter; orchestrated the (politically motivated) firing of deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe; and disparaged Robert Mueller’s investigation — by name — for the first time ever. In most, if not all, of these cases, ((ul))the president((/ul)) either ((ul))acted over the objections of senior advisers, or without bothering to consult them at all. ((/ul))((ul))The election of an emotionally volatile reality star — with authoritarian instincts, an insatiable ego((/ul)), ((ul))a capacious ignorance of American civics and geopolitics, and an implacable aversion to reading multi-page documents — led many a commentator to seek solace in the thought that Trump wouldn’t really be in charge((/ul)). Precisely because he was so ignorant of — and uninterested in — governance, the new president would delegate critical decisions to his team of decorated generals, veteran GOP operatives, and corporate titans. He would handle the tweets, speeches, and petty graft; they’d handle the policy. ((ul))Trump’s first 14 months produced plenty of evidence to support this hypothesis. But the past few weeks have fatally undermined it.((/ul)) The White House isn’t preparing for face-to-face talks with North Korea because James Mattis decided that was a good idea; or drafting $60 billion worth of tariffs against China because that’s what the GOP Establishment wanted. These things are happening solely because Trump decided to make them happen. That maniac on Twitter really is the president of the United States. And as more and more “adults” exit the West Wing — and it becomes more and more difficult to find normal, competent people willing to take their places — the chances of a return to last year’s “normalcy” grow ever more remote. ((ul))((hl))2) Trump’s path to a war with North Korea has never been easier to envision((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).((/hl)) ((ul))The fact that Donald ((/ul))((ul))Trump’s gut instincts are now governing the White House((/ul))((ul)) would be alarming in just about any context((/ul)). But in the present one, it is especially so. Two weeks ago, Trump accepted (on a whim) Kim Jong-un’s invitation for a face-to-face meeting. At first, criticism of this decision focused on the prospect that our prodigiously ignorant, easily flattered commander-in-chief would get suckered into a lopsided peace deal. But Victor Cha — Trump’s tentative pick for ambassador to South Korea, who (reportedly) lost that gig for his off-putting opposition to a preemptive strike on Pyongyang — highlighted a more ominous possibility in an op-ed for the New York Times: Everyone should be aware that this dramatic act of diplomacy by these two unusual leaders, who love flair and drama, may also take us closer to war. Failed negotiations at the summit level leave all parties with no other recourse for diplomacy. In which case, as Mr. Trump has said, we really will have “run out of road” on North Korea. The likelihood of this nightmare scenario increased significantly, last week, when Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and (reportedly) began seriously considering making John Bolton his next national security adviser. For his many, many faults, Tillerson was nevertheless one of the administration’s staunchest defenders of the Iran nuclear agreement — and among its most ardent opponents of a belligerent approach to North Korea. By contrast, his replacement — outgoing CIA director Mike Pompeo — was the only senior White House official who encouraged Trump to decertify the Iran deal, even as his colleagues in the intelligence agencies affirmed Tehran’s compliance with the agreement. Trump’s summit with Kim is tentatively scheduled for May. That same month, the president will need to either reaffirm Iran’s compliance with the agreement — or else withdraw the United States from the deal. The president (reportedly) told Benjamin Netanyahu that he intends to pick door No.2. Pompeo’s promotion increases the probability that Trump will keep that pledge. And if the president does, in fact, reaffirm the emptiness of America’s promises to rogue regimes – right before sitting down across from Kim – then North Korea would have to be an irrational actor to take him up on any denuclearization deal. It is true that, to this point, Defense Secretary James ((ul))Mattis((/ul)) and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster have ((ul))kept Trump from blowing up the Iran agreement((/ul)). And the fact that nullifying that deal would compromise diplomatic efforts with North Korea surely won’t escape those officials. ((ul))((hl))But Mattis lost the internal fight over tariffs((/hl))((/ul)), and also, presumably, over Tillerson. Meanwhile, McMaster may be on his way out of the administration — and one of the top candidates to replace him is an Iran hawk who is publicly rooting for diplomacy with North Korea to fail. “How do you know the North Koreans are lying? Because their lips are moving,” John Bolton explained to Fox News last week. The former U.N. ambassador went on to argue that Trump’s meeting with Kim Jong-un was a positive development — because, as Cha had warned, it could accelerate the breakdown of diplomacy and the onset of military action to combat the North Korean threat. (A recent Pentagon simulation projected that a nonnuclear war between the United States and North Korea would come with a daily death toll of 20,000 in South Korea.) If recent rumors prove true, Bolton will be the highest-ranking national-security official in the White House come May. ((ul))3) Trump has never had a stronger incentive to undermine rule of law in the United States((/ul)). In recent weeks, the special counsel has subpoenaed documents from the Trump Organization, sought an interview with the president himself, secured the cooperation of various Trump campaign aides and associates, and scrutinized the business dealings of the president’s son-in-law. Throughout his presidency, ((ul))Trump has displayed an aversion to the concept of “rule of law((/ul)).” ((ul))He has argued repeatedly that he believes the Justice Department’s first responsibility is to protect him from legal harm. Now, he has more cause for indulging this authoritarian impulse than ever before((/ul)). And indulging it, he is. Late Friday night, Jeff Sessions fired Andrew McCabe — just 26 hours before the G-man was set to qualify for his pension. McCabe immediately alleged that he’d been fired for crass political reasons — Trump was trying to discredit him as part of a broader attempt to obstruct and delegitimize the special counsel’s investigation. Trump promptly confirmed this charge. In a tweet celebrating McCabe’s firing, the president did not refer to any findings from the inspector general’s report that had officially triggered the deputy FBI director’s ouster, opting instead to denounce McCabe for his ties to James Comey, and complicity in “the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!” The president proceeded to publicly assail the Mueller probe, arguing that it was launched on the basis of a “Fake Dossier” (which is indisputably untrue) and that the investigative team leading it includes “Zero Republicans” (Robert Mueller is a Republican). Meanwhile, one of Trump’s lawyers called for the investigation to be shut down. Ultimately, these attacks are less alarming for their immediate effects, than for the signal that they send to the rest of federal law enforcement. Andrew McCabe is going to be fine. He has a range of options for recovering his pension, and (surely) for selling his tell-all book. And, as of this writing, the Mueller probe is still alive and kicking — in no small part because shutting down the investigation would be enormously difficult and costly for the president. Beyond the complex series of personnel changes required to dispatch Mueller and his team, the high-profile nature of the investigation ensures that its untimely death would result in a blizzard of politically damaging leaks. Still, as Vox’s Matt Yglesias writes: Part of the normal scandal aversion of a normal administration is that middle managers in the federal bureaucracy who sincerely support the president will try not to create a scandal. So it’s not just that Obama would not personally reach down into an investigation and meddle for political purposes, but a passionate Obama fan who also happens to run an Environmental Protection Agency field office wouldn’t do it either. The top leadership sets a tone, and while the tone isn’t universally followed, it does exert a big influence on people’s practical behavior. ((ul))Trump((/ul)), by contrast, has sent a clear signal in the opposite direction — he ((ul))wants federal public servants((/ul)), up to and including FBI special agents, ((ul))to act like they are his personal employees. ((/ul))That doesn’t mean they’ll all do it — most of them won’t. But ((ul))some of them will((/ul)). The actual political appointees at every agency know what’s expected of them, and to the extent that there are ambitious and career-minded Trump fans scattered throughout the government — which is surely the case at the federal police agencies, if not the regulatory ones — they know that excessive service of Trump’s personal interests will be rewarded rather than punished. ((ul))If Donald Trump really puts his mind to weaponizing federal agencies, he could inflict a tremendous amount of damage on our democracy((/ul)). Thanks to the the War on Terror (and Barack Obama), Trump has inherited the legal authority to indefinitely detain anyone his administration deems a suspected terrorist or to assassinate Americans overseas without trial — and the technological wherewithal to spy on his political enemies, should he find or cultivate friendly renegades within the intelligence community. Separately, his administration’s responsibilities for administering the 2020 census and safeguarding the security of our elections provide significant opportunities for undermining democratic rule, should Trump and his allies become more adept at corrupting the federal bureaucracy. To this point, the strongest protection against such nightmare scenarios has been Trump’s dearth of ambition. No one ever became a successful dictator by watching eight hours of cable news each day, and taking a golf vacation nearly every weekend. But the Mueller probe is forcing the president (and his advisers) to think deeply about how the “deep state” can be co-opted. And ((ul))as Trump has grown more self-confident, he’s begun tackling that problem with more energy and creativity((/ul)). It remains difficult to believe that Trump has the wherewithal to outmaneuver senior civil servants throughout the Executive branch. But it’s a bit less difficult now than it was a few weeks ago; and it’s quite easy to imagine that the Democratic Party’s 2020 nominee will campaign while under some form of federal investigation. ((ul))4) It’s never been clearer that Congressional Republicans are unwilling to act as a check on Trump’s worst impulses.((/ul)) ((ul))Congressional Republicans have been abetting Trump’s corruption from the earliest days of his administration((/ul)). But at various points in the president’s first year, GOP lawmakers signaled that there was an outer limit to their sycophancy. Last summer, as Trump publicly berated his attorney general for recusing himself from the FBI’s Russia investigation, Mitch McConnell kept the Senate formally in session through its August vacation to prevent the president from unilaterally replacing Jeff Sessions through a recess appointment. That same month, North Carolina Republican Thom Tillis spearheaded a Senate bill designed to immunize Mueller’s probe against a White House attack. At the time, some pundits took these moves as a sign that Republicans would turn more forcefully against the president once they’d secured their tax cuts and/or, once his atrocious approval ratings began weighing on the party’s 2018 prospects. But the very opposite happened. In recent weeks, ((ul))as Democrats racked up improbable special-election victories((/ul)), and the White House’s scandals continued to metastasize, ((ul))Republicans grew even more craven in their fealty to the president((/ul))((ul)). The House Intelligence Committee progressed from shielding the president from federal investigators to attacking those investigators on his behalf((/ul)): In February, the committee’s Republicans released a memo, which purported to demonstrate that the FBI had used opposition research funded by Hillary Clinton to obtain a surveillance warrant of Trump aide Carter Page, one month before the 2016 election — without disclosing the political motivations behind said research to the relevant authorities. Republican lawmakers hyped these and related claims, with Senator Ron Johnson going so far as to announce that a “secret society” of anti-Trump Democrats was fomenting “corruption of the highest levels of the FBI.” But Nunes’s memo did not actually demonstrate anything of that kind, while its most concrete allegations of FBI malfeasance were subsequently proven false. And yet, four GOP senators nevertheless asked the Justice Department last week to appoint a second special counsel to investigate the FBI’s investigation into Russia. More remarkably, ((ul))Republicans aren’t just abetting Trump’s attacks on the rule of law — they’re even acquiescing to his assaults on their donors’ economic interests((/ul)): After Trump unveiled his steel tariffs earlier this month, Arizona senator Jeff Flake put together legislation nullifying the president’s authority to take such trade actions without congressional consent — and the Senate GOP leadership promptly disavowed the measure. Some pundits retain hope that the congressional GOP has a breaking point — that, should Trump cross a certain line, Republicans would suddenly find it in their political interest to distance themselves from him. This may be the case. But there’s reason to think that the incentive for Republican lawmakers to stick by Trump is actually growing stronger as his administration becomes more scandal-ridden.((ul)) In an era of hyperpolarization, most midterm elections are won or lost on turnout((/ul)). Which means that, ((ul))the more energized the other side’s base becomes, the more critical it is for you to retain the enthusiasm of your core constituency((/ul)). We first glimpsed the perverse incentives that this dynamic can create last spring, when some moderate Republicans in the House voted for a deeply unpopular health-care bill precisely because it generated such passionate opposition. As Politico reported, “As GOP leaders scrambled to bring the last holdouts aboard in recent days, they made the argument that the liberal base is already on fire … That means Republicans could ill afford to fall short on their health-care promise and risk depressing their own turnout.” ((ul))Republican strategists are now using this exact same argument to caution GOP lawmakers against distancing themselves from Trump((/ul)). And, in this case, they’re almost certainly right. Matters might be different had Republicans spent the past 14 months passing popular legislation and building a base of support independent from Trump’s. But they did no such thing. GOP voters have a far higher regard for the president than for Paul Ryan’s agenda. The number of Americans who passionately support slashing Medicaid and taxes on the rich but despise Donald Trump is minuscule. Thus, ((ul))in the most if not all of their (heavily gerrymandered) House districts, GOP incumbents have more to lose from angering Trump voters than alienating anti-Trump independents — and ((/ul))((ul))((hl))this very well might remain the case, when and if the president shoots someone dead in the middle of Fifth Avenue.((/hl))((/ul))"],"stats":{"highlightedWords":93}},{"tag":"Official comments prove war and escalation is possible ","cite":"Trilling 16 — (David Trilling, 6-24-2016, \"Water Wars in Central Asia,\" Published by Foreign Affairs, https://www.foreignaffairs.com/gallerys/2016-08-24/water-wars-central-asia, Accessed 6-20-2018, JWS)","text":["((ul))((hl))The relations of((/hl))((/ul)) the five former Soviet Republics in ((ul))((hl))Central Asia((/hl))((/ul))—Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan—((ul))((hl))are((/hl))((/ul)), more often than not, ((ul))((hl))defined by water((/hl))((/ul)).

But since the dissolution of the Soviet Union over a quarter century ago, that system has collapsed. Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan now face constant blackouts and hope to build giant dams to provide for their energy needs. Kyrgyzstan completed its Kambarata-2 power station in 2010 and is building a second one, Kambarata-1, with the help of Russia. Although he doesn’t have the funds, Tajik President Emomali Rahmon often speaks zealously about his mission to build a 335-meter dam, Rogun, which has the potential to turn his impoverished statelet into a powerbroker. But there is one glaring issue: the region’s glaciers, the source of huge and once predictable water supplies, are melting at record rates. Every year, it loses about as much water as consumed by a country the size of Switzerland. And the dams stand to limit water supply even further for the downstream countries. This has set them on edge. Along the disputed frontiers of the Fergana Valley, which is spread out over three of the countries, locals bicker with their neighbors over irrigation water. These small spats quickly escalate. In 2014, Kyrgyz and Tajik conscripts exchanged fire over a strategic sluice in Ak-Sai.

The treaty is exemplary since it has survived dozens of Indo-Pak military skirmishes, hostile political atmospheres, and diplomatic hiccups.

As long ago as 2002, Indian Water Resources Minister Bijoya Chakroborty threatened, “If we decide to scrap the Indus Water Treaty, then there will be drought in Pakistan, and the people of that country would have to beg for every drop of water.” After the September 2016 attack by militants on an Indian army base in Kashmir, India announced plans to accelerate construction of dams in Kashmir on the rivers that flow into Pakistan and to suspend the bilateral Indus Waters Commission that administers the treaty and manages disputes over its implementation. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared “blood and water cannot flow together.” Pakistan for its part has announced that an Indian revocation of the treaty could be taken as an “act of war.” Pakistan’s government, nationalist and militant organizations, and right-wing media frequently now present India’s construction of dams in Kashmir as a pressing national security threat and one that may call for extreme responses. An editorial in one leading urdu-language Pakistani newspaper in 2011 declared “((ul))Pakistan should convey to India that a ((/ul))((ul))((hl))war((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) is possible ((/ul))((ul))((hl))on the issue of water((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) and this time war ((/ul))((ul))((hl))will be a nuclear one((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).” ((/ul))Nuclear forces and postures. Since the Indian and Pakistani nuclear weapon tests of May 1998, the two states have expanded many-fold their respective nuclear weapon and fissile material stockpiles and undertaken extensive development and testing of a diverse array of ballistic and cruise missiles (with ranges from 60 to 5000 kilometers), acquiring the ability to deploy and launch nuclear weapons from the air, from land, and from submarines at sea. They have put in place command and control systems and doctrines that involve, in the case of Pakistan, first use of nuclear weapons in a conflict and, in the case of India, massive retaliatory strikes against population centers. In 1999, the two countries fought a war which apparently included mobilization of nuclear weapons by Pakistan, making it the most significant military conflict between two nuclear armed states. They also went through a major military crisis (December 2001 to June 2002) triggered by an attack on India’s parliament by Islamist militants believed in India to be backed by Pakistan. The response to the attack included the two countries moving a combined total of more than half a million troops to their border. The slow pace of Indian deployment and inconclusive outcome of the stand-off led India’s army to begin planning and training for a more decisive and rapid conventional attack on Pakistan. Pakistan began testing a short-range, truck-mounted missile to deliver low-yield nuclear weapons on the battlefield. This latter development has increased longstanding international concerns about the security of nuclear weapons and fissile materials in Pakistan, given the large-scale and frequent Islamist militant attacks on military targets in the country and the ideological polarization within the armed forces and broader society associated with the rise of hardline Islamist political groups over the past three decades. ((ul))((hl))Pakistan has long been explicit about((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) its ((/ul))((ul))((hl))plans to use nuclear weapons to counter India((/hl))((/ul))((hl))n((/hl)) conventional forces. In March 2015, the former head of Pakistan’s Strategic Plans Division, retired General Khalid Kidwai, announced that the country had developed “a variety of short range, low yield nuclear weapons.” Pakistani Foreign Secretary Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry declared that his country might use these tactical nuclear weapons in a conflict with India. The New York Times reported in 2015 that so far, “an unknown number of the tactical weapons were built, but not deployed” by Pakistan. From tactical weapons to massive retaliation. India anticipates that Pakistan might use nuclear weapons against Indian conventional forces during a war. The Indian Army conducted a massive military exercise in April 2016 in the Rajasthan Desert bordering Pakistan, involving tanks, artillery, armored personnel carriers, and 30,000 soldiers who practiced what they would do if attacked with nuclear weapons on the battlefield. An Indian Army spokesman told the media that “our policy has been always that we will never use nuclear weapons first. But if we are attacked, we need to gather ourselves and fight through it. The simulation is about doing exactly that.” This was not the first such exercise. Indian nuclear doctrine also calls for massive retaliation directed at Pakistani cities, and Pakistan has threatened to respond in kind. In 2003, India’s cabinet declared nuclear weapons “will only be used in retaliation against a nuclear attack on Indian territory or on Indian forces anywhere… [((ul))N]uclear retaliation to a first strike will be massive and designed to inflict unacceptable damage((/ul)).” According to Admiral Vijay Shankar, a former head of Indian strategic nuclear forces, such retaliation would involve nuclear attacks on Pakistan’s cities. General Kidwai from Pakistan describes such Indian threats as “bluster and blunder,” since they “are not taking into account the balance of nuclear weapons of Pakistan, which hopefully not, but has the potential to go back and give the same kind of dose to the other side.” This seems an explicit suggestion of Pakistan planning to target Indian cities with nuclear weapons in retaliation of Indian nuclear attacks on Pakistani cities. From regional war to great power war. Time is not on our side. ((ul))The failure to settle the((/ul)) Kashmir ((ul))dispute((/ul)) despite the passage of 70 years ((ul))has already triggered three wars((/ul)). While Pakistan clings grimly to its claims on Kashmir, India seems less inclined to compromise as it grows in economic and military power. Adding to this will be the ((ul))inevitable pressures from ((/ul))climate change over the coming decades on the Himalayan glaciers, the monsoons, and ((ul))ground water((/ul)) in the Indus Basin, ((ul))which will lead to reduced and less reliable access to water in an already water-stressed region((/ul)), at a time of rapidly growing demand.

But since the dissolution of the Soviet Union over a quarter century ago, that system has collapsed. Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan now face constant blackouts and hope to build giant dams to provide for their energy needs. Kyrgyzstan completed its Kambarata-2 power station in 2010 and is building a second one, Kambarata-1, with the help of Russia. Although he doesn’t have the funds, Tajik President Emomali Rahmon often speaks zealously about his mission to build a 335-meter dam, Rogun, which has the potential to turn his impoverished statelet into a powerbroker. But there is one glaring issue: the region’s glaciers, the source of huge and once predictable water supplies, are melting at record rates. Every year, it loses about as much water as consumed by a country the size of Switzerland. And the dams stand to limit water supply even further for the downstream countries. This has set them on edge. Along the disputed frontiers of the Fergana Valley, which is spread out over three of the countries, locals bicker with their neighbors over irrigation water. These small spats quickly escalate. In 2014, Kyrgyz and Tajik conscripts exchanged fire over a strategic sluice in Ak-Sai.

At times, this causes water to be thought of in simplistic terms as a commodity, rather than a basic building block of life, access to which is detailed in several international human rights conventions, but not explicitly recognized as a self-standing human right in international treaties. ((ul))When countries deny other states water((/ul)) or imply they might use water as leverage for political gain, ((ul))this is water conflict, and ((/ul))((ul))it's brewing in Central Asia((/ul)). Within the context of Central Asia, to simplify, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan have it, and Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan need more of it. The latter two are very nervous about the resource imbalance. Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan are upstream of Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan, giving them control of two trans-border rivers. Eurasianet points out that ((ul))one of the central issues facing((/ul)) the five ((ul))((hl))Central Asia((/hl))((/ul))n republics ((ul))is that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))leaders((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) there ((/ul))((ul))((hl))are more ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))known for rivalry than cooperation((/hl))((/ul)), ((ul))((hl))which could greatly((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))complicate any resolution on water((/hl))((/ul)) scarcity in the overall region. Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan are poorer than Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, so control over water is one of the few ways they are able to retain leverage over the (current) two international leaders in the region. Previously, Tajikistan has claimed that it needs to construct a hydroelectric power plant, which will improve the struggling economy, however, as Tye Sundlee reports, the recent discovery of a potential 'supergiant' oil field is likely to undermine these claims and stall the development of any hydroelectric power stations, especially since Uzbekistan has strenuously opposed plans for a power stations in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan for a number of years, worrying it will cede too much resource control to the poorer countries. But the question remains - what does all this squabbling add up to? Will these countries actually deny water to each other, in this dry region that is heavily dependent on crops? Uzbekistan is reportedly the sixth largest producer of cotton worldwide (though their harvest practices leave something to be desired), and Kyrgyzstan, though the economy is heavily dependent on gold exports, has a large and essential agricultural sector. Despite this need for water to sustain the economies of both countries, the answer to the above question is yes - ((ul))((hl))Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan have used water as political leverage in the past((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) for political gain ((/ul))((ul))((hl))and could do so again((/hl))((/ul)). Thus Karimov's harsh words last week, warning of water wars. In 2010, Kyrgyzstan diverted the flow of the Talas River, which is a source of irrigation of Kazakhstan's agricultural sector. Kyrgyzstan did so because Kazakhstan closed the border between two countries following uprisings and instability in Kyrgyzstan. A few hours after the river had been diverted, Kazakhstan re-opened the border. Confused? Here's the simplified take: Uprisings took place in Kyrgyzstan, so Kazakhstan closed the border. Kyrgyzstan wasn't happy about this, so they 'turned off the taps' to Kazakhstan, denying them water. A few hours after the water was diverted away from Kazakhstan, Kazakhstan relented and re-opened the borders to Kyrgyzstan. Thus we see water being used to achieve political measures. Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan are unhappy being in any way beholden to their poorer neighbors, but especially for something as vital as water - not only to their economies but to the literal life of their people. This precedent of water being used as leverage bodes poorly for water being seen as external to political gain, or as simply a human right. ((ul))The leaders of Central Asia are already deeply suspicious of each other, and ((/ul))((ul))((hl))border skirmishes are a common occurrence((/hl))((/ul)).

For being one of the greatest geographical regions, ((ul))((hl))Central Asia has limited water resources((/hl))((/ul)). Modern history of the region has been fueled with various ethnic and territorial clashes. Apparently, the main catalysts behind conflicts have been attempts to take control of rich water resources. The main sources of water in Central Asia are the Syr Darya and Amu Darya Rivers, mostly fed by snow- and glacier-melt from the Pamir, Hindu Kush and Tien Shan mountain ranges. The 2,200-kilometer Syr Darya originates in the Tien Shan, flows through Kyrgyzstan as the Naryn River and combines with the Kara Darya to become the Syr Darya. The water resource crisis is not a new phenomenon in Central Asia. With the eventual fall of the Soviet Union, the resource-sharing system it imposed on the region totally disintegrated. ((ul))The root of the problem is that the main water resources in Central Asia flow from territories of Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan((/ul)). Kyrgyzstan holds rule of downstream Syr-Darya flow at the Toktogul dam, while Tajikistan re-launched the building of Rogun dam on Vakhsh River, which was then shot down due to lack of funds and strained relations with neighboring Uzbekistan. If completed, Rogun dam will be able to ensure mountainous Tajikistan electricity, as it is in need of energy. Despite its quite favorable location in an energy-rich region, the Central Asian country faces energy-related problems. Kyrgyzstan faces the same problem with the water supply of Toktogul, which provides almost 90% of the country’s electricity. Tension also derives from conflict over the Toktogul water reservoir, which is a major point of contention for Kyrgyzstan and neighboring countries. The rich water resources of Kyrgyzstan further led to intensive border clashes with Uzbekistan several times. The latter deployed military troops along its border with Kyrgyzstan on March 24, 2016. Undoubtedly, Uzbekistan’s attempt to reclaim Ala-Buka water reservoir in Kyrgyzstan territory flared up tensions in the border and led to a deterioration of bilateral relations. Even though both countries are still far from reaching consensus over the water reservoir, Bishkek plans to build a Kambarata-3 Hydro Power Plant to produce hydro-energy for exporting to neighboring states, which will give Kyrgyzstan significant leverage over Uzbekistan. The Kambarata hydropower plant would be built on the Naryn River, a tributary of the Syr Darya. Along with Rogun dam, these two are to be the largest dams in Central Asia, with potential generating capacities of 1,900 megawatts and 3,600 megawatts. However, Tashkent strongly opposes this project, worrying that Kambarata will limit or disrupt the flow of irrigation water essential to its cotton fields and farmers. Although none of these dams are completed yet, concerns over how they would shift regional balance of power in Central Asia rise intensely. Yet, the failure of the Kyrgyz, Tajik and Uzbek governments to modernize water-dependent sectors, such as energy and agriculture increases their mutual dependence on each other. Considering this controversy, Uzbekistan enacts policy aimed at decreasing dependence from Toktogul reservoir by building a reservoir that is capable of storing 2.5 billion cubic meters of water. However, Uzbek authorities realized soon that it is nearly impossible to get enough power from the plant to provinces, in particular the Uzbek part of Fergana Valley, which highly suffers from lack of portable water and does not have any alternatives to farming. According to numbers, deficits of portable water in the Uzbek part of Fergana reach 1.5 billion cubic meters in a year, which is very high compared to Tajikistan and the Kyrgyzstan part of Fergana. The Fergana Valley, a landlocked, overpopulated region with 60 million people is a less favorable place for farming due to its desertification problem, outdated Soviet-era infrastructure (which has not been modernized since the 1950s) and poor water management, which exacerbates Fergana’s problems even worse. Fewer and fewer people have access to clean water since the collapse of the Soviet Union, because of low economic growth of newly independent states.

The Fergana Valley is a major source of food for Central Asia. The agricultural productivity has made the Fergana Valley the most densely populated part of Central Asia. While the population density of Central Asia as a whole is 40.8 people per square mile, in the Fergana Valley it is 1,600 people per square mile. It is also one of the fastest-growing regions within Central Asia, experiencing a population growth of 32% in the last 10 years."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":35}},{"tag":"Central Asian conflict definitely escalates","cite":"Ziegler and Menon 14 — Ziegler is a Distinguished University Scholar and professor of political science at the University of Louisville; Menon holds the Anne and Bernard Spitzer chair in political science at the University of New York (Charles E.

Russian and Chinese neomercantilist strategies, in effect, promote a regionalism that enables them to resolve conflicts and promote stability while resisting the presence of the global hegemon.36 Although Russia provides one-quarter to one-third of Central Asia’s imports and absorbs 10–20 percent of the region’s exports, its privileged position in the region is in danger of being eroded. China’s economic presence is increasing rapidly; more importantly, the China-Russia economic relationship in Central Asia is basically competitive and will become more so. This competition is already evident as Moscow promotes its Customs Union as a trading bloc, while China maneuvers to position the SCO as its preferred economic regime. In this environment, powerful state-controlled energy firms (and indeed non-energy state-owned companies) seek relative gains for their patron states, with the state exercising its power to advance firms’ interests. While the rivalry between the Russia-China partnership and the West gets the most attention these days, in the long run the competition in Central Asia will pit Beijing against Moscow, with both seeking to dominate the sources and transportation networks for Central Asia’s energy. This is not to suggest an imminent military conflict between Russia and China in Central Asia. But President Putin’s drive to expand the Customs Union into a broader Eurasian Union comprised of both Central Asian and European former Soviet republics provides regional elites with a guarantee against encroachment from powerful neighbors, whether from the East (China) or West (the EU and NATO).37 Membership in the Customs Union appeals to Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Belarus not because it will generate substantial economic benefits, but more so because of the political protection it will afford. In Ukraine’s case, conflicting pressures have splintered the country between those who prefer Moscow’s design and those who favor a European path. Unease over China’s growing presence in Central Asia and the absence of such clear lines of demarcation within these countries suggests that instability there will likely derive from state weakness and problems of succession rather than great-power competition.

In cases that involve enhancing this capability, doubts will be expressed by those countries if China does not maintain a certain degree of transparency and accountability and explain its intentions. And if Beijing makes loans that are beyond the ability of the recipient country to repay, China’s acquisition of controlling interests in the ports will give its neighbors to understand that it is leveraging this capability and its economic power to acquire those controlling interests.

((ul))China is following in the traditional path of other rising powers; it is expanding its military operations to match its interests abroad((/ul)). ((ul))((hl))The Chinese economy is highly reliant on trade routes((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) that pass ((/ul))((ul))((hl))through the Indian Ocean((/hl))((/ul)), which serves as a vital pathway, particularly for energy supplies. ((ul))((hl))It is natural((/hl))((/ul)), therefore, ((ul))for the Chinese government ((/ul))((ul))((hl))to ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))seek to protect its interests((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) along these sea lines((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) of communication((/ul)). Leaders in Beijing have reason to be concerned about multiple potential risks in the region, ranging from maritime piracy to the potential for the United States or India to disrupt Chinese supply lines if a conflict were to occur. China’s efforts to project power in the Indian Ocean are nascent, but their outlines are becoming clear. To sustain military forces in the Indian Ocean region, China needs to have reliable access to facilities in key points around the region. China’s new military base in Djibouti provides a rudimentary power-projection base, which is bolstered by its access to ports in Bangladesh, Burma, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Although China is using its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to fund many of these projects, there is no question that the infrastructure is being created with dual-use purposes in mind. How might China use these facilities in peacetime? The most likely Chinese strategy would be to rely on port facilities to refuel and resupply its naval vessels without having to come back to Chinese facilities in East Asia. In the years ahead, it would not be surprising to see the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) develop some rudimentary facilities in the region for conducting at least minor repairs. These types of activities would provide China with a greater ability to sustain forces in theater, thereby avoiding the costly and time-consuming practice of having to foray from distant ports in mainland China. How might China use its forces in peacetime? In the near term, China will likely continue to conduct counter-piracy operations around the Horn of Africa. This serves multiple purposes. First, it gives Chinese forces practice conducting difficult operations at a great distance from the mainland. Such efforts are helpful for assessing shortcomings in the PLA’s ability to sustain power-projection forces far from China’s shores. Second, counter-piracy provides a window into the operational patterns of foreign militaries. This may be useful both from an intelligence-gathering perspective and for helping the PLA to compare its strengths and weaknesses to those of foreign militaries, including the United States, India, Japan, Australia, and others. Chinese vessels may also conduct some more specific intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions to better understand regional militaries and gather data on the geographic area in and around the Indian Ocean. Mapping undersea features would be particularly beneficial in preparing for a potential wartime scenario. Such activities could help to provide information on the typical operating practices of potential challengers, to include the Indian Navy. ((ul))((hl))China may also((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) seek to ((/ul))((ul))((hl))conduct((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) training and ((/ul))((ul))((hl))exercises in the region((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), potentially ((/ul))((ul))((hl))in partnership with other militaries((/hl))((/ul)). Although Beijing is unlikely to find any highly capable partners in the region, it could work with less capable maritime states, such as Pakistan, to help them develop their maritime capabilities. This would also serve to expand the number of concerns for the Indian military, potentially stretching the Indian Navy. Such efforts could serve as a response to Indian efforts to build maritime capacity in Southeast Asia with states such as Vietnam. In short, Chinese operations in the Indian Ocean during peacetime are likely to resemble those of other great powers, including the United States.

Deng Xiaoping is remembered for the concept of “Socialism with Chinese Characteristics,” President Jian Zeming is known for his nebulous governing “Theory of the Three Represents,” and President Hu Jintao for his ambition to achieve a “Harmonious Society.” Following their footsteps, President ((ul))((hl))Xi((/hl))((/ul)) Jinping ((ul))((hl))is extensively promoting((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) his own signature slogan: ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the “Chinese Dream.”((/hl))((/ul)) President Xi’s Chinese Dream is a necessary and timely concept, which he made public for the first time in the China National Museum, surrounded by an exhibition documenting foreign invasions since the First Opium War in 1840, in particular. The painful humiliations that the Chinese nation suffered at the hands of the West and Japan are regularly revived by China’s leadership to energize and motivate the Chinese masses to participate in the Chinese Dream. Xi’s Chinese Dream can be seen as the spiritual dimension for which an increasingly wealthy and educated Chinese society is yearning. ((ul))While various Chinese groups((/ul)) (armed forces, farmers, officials, businessmen, etc.) ((ul))have their own distinct interpretations of what the Chinese Dream means((/ul)) and how it should be achieved, ((ul))((hl))t((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))here is little controversy over its((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ultimate ((/ul))((ul))((hl))goal: “fulfilling the((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) great ((/ul))((ul))((hl))renaissance of the Chinese race,” i.e. the Han race((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).((/hl)) ((ul))Hence, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the Chinese Dream is((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) essentially ((/ul))((ul))((hl))a nationalistic ambition((/hl))((/ul)). And while love and pride for one’s own culture, history, and country are not problematic per se, ((ul))if not managed adequately, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))nationalism can nurture((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) an undesirable sentiment((/ul)): chauvinism, in this case, ((ul))((hl))Han chauvinism((/hl))((/ul)). Among the 56 officially recognized ethnic groups in China, the Han is by far the largest and influential one. It represents 92% of the Chinese population and has dominated the culture and politics for most of China’s 5,000-year long history. In the current China, Han are in full control of China’s politics, economy, and socio-cultural values. ((ul))((hl))Han consider their way of life((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) and culture ((/ul))((ul))((hl))superior to others((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), resulting in them having strong chauvinistic tendencies((/ul)). That Han chauvinism, or Hanism, poses a serious threat to China’s unity and stability have been extensively recognized by China’s leadership. Han Chauvinism: A Recognized Threat to China Communist Party of China’s (CPC) leaders such as Chairman Mao, Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaoping, and President Xi have warned about the threat that Han chauvinism poses. As early as 1938, and often thereafter, Chairman Mao cautioned Han officials about prevailing Hanism as a source of interethnic conflict and the need to eliminate it in order to achieve ethnic unity, the very foundation on which China’s stability should stand: Interethnic relationships are conflictive in certain regions due to Han chauvinism. Party members cannot tolerate this and we should deeply criticize Han chauvinism that occurs among party members and cadres… We should correct this mistake immediately. To correct Han chauvinism, Chairman Mao advised Han officials to be more humble, to listen to ethnic minorities’ grievances, and to accept their criticism. As for Premier Deng Xiaoping, he believed that Han chauvinism should be eliminated before asking minorities to do the same with their own chauvinisms: As soon as Han reject Han chauvinism, the ethnic minorities will also be willing to reject their own narrow nationalism in return. We cannot ask from ethnic minorities to reject their narrow nationalism without first honestly rejecting the one big nationalism (Hanism). Most recently, in 2014, President Xi Jinping and other CPC high-ranking officials discussed the threat of Han chauvinism during the Ethnic Affairs Work Conference, and released a statement emphasizing that “ethnic unity is the lifeline of Chinese people of all ethnicities and that to protect it we should stand firmly against great Hanism and ultra-nationalism.” These quotes illustrate the fact that CPC’s leadership continues to be aware of the magnitude of the threat that Han chauvinism poses to the Chinese nation. It seems, however, that the CPC has not yet been successful in harnessing it and now, the Chinese Dream might further reinforce Hanism. Despite China’s globalization, the Han continue to consider other cultures as inferior, resulting, for example, in the Han feeling that their culture and history is far superior to those of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang territory in northwest China. As a consequence of their discriminatory treatment by the Han, the Uyghurs feel that their identity is under attack and that they are being treated as second-class citizens in their own homeland. Han chauvinism seems to have been growing stronger in Xinjiang, particularly since the Urumqi riots in 2009, and it is dangerously undermining Beijing’s efforts to achieve harmonious inter-ethnic relations by impairing Han officials from understanding Xinjiang’s socioeconomic, political, religious, and security tensions. If the chauvinistic tendencies from which the Han community suffers are not recognized and addressed, Xinjiang’s inter-ethnic relations will worsen and could become a significant source of instability and threat to China. Furthermore, ((ul))Chinese ((/ul))((ul))((hl))chauvinism has already started((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))poisoning China’s((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))personal ((/ul))((ul))((hl))relations in foreign countries((/hl))((/ul)).

((ul))Most people do not admire censorship of the press or suppression of dissent((/ul)).

China can’t credibly claim to lead the way for trade liberalization if it doesn’t practice what it preaches and it won’t boost its soft power by setting expectations for how it will behave on trade that it has no intention of meeting. Nor is China well positioned to defend freedom of trade given its poor record on freedom of navigation. China’s actions in the South China Sea include making maritime claims such as the nine-dash line that have no basis in international law. Freedom of navigation is inherently bound up in freedom of trade. China’s insistence that it has the right to exclude others from the South China Sea undermines the credibility of any claim that it is defending the liberal world order. Xi’s defense of globalization is certainly appreciated but it is unlikely to lead to a meaningful increase in China’s soft power until people around the world see China further open up its economy and its political system.

((ul))By the 1970s((/ul)), however, ((ul))this((/ul)) national ((ul))sense of urgency and commitment to excellence in STEM education had ((/ul))((ul))lapsed into complacency((/ul)). In 1983, the landmark report, A Nation at Risk, noted that “the ideal of academic excellence as the primary goal of schooling seems to be fading across the board in American education.”3 In 2005, nearly a quarter century after A Nation at Risk, the alarm once again was sounded over the looming challenge to U.S. pre-eminence in science and technology (S&T) in the National Academies’ seminal report, Rising Above the Gathering Storm. 4 This report posited that ((ul))in the 21st century, educated, talented, motivated people and their ideas are paramount to creating the innovations that will sustain America’s prosperity((/ul)).5 Finally, in 2009, the Administration’s Strategy for American Innovation argued for investing in the building blocks of innovation, promoting competitive markets, and catalyzing breakthroughs for our Nation’s priorities.","A critical facet of America’s historical advantage in S&T innovation has been the ability to attract, develop, and retain talented individuals from abroad. Indeed, over the past few decades, many STEM fields in the United States have become increasingly dependent on foreign-born talent. However, ((ul))global competition for STEM talent is growing((/ul)) ((ul))as many countries increase their R&D capacity and improve their own STEM education systems((/ul)). In light of this, ((ul))((hl))it remains essential that the Nation((/hl))((/ul)) not only continue to attract STEM talent from abroad, but also ((ul))((hl))renew and redouble its efforts to identify and ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))develop domestic human capital((/hl))((/ul)) as well. ","The Board’s 2-year examination of this issue made clear one fundamental reality: ((ul))((hl))the U.S. education system too frequently ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))fails to identify and develop((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) our most talented and motivated students((/hl))((/ul)) who will become the next generation of innovators. Whether this group of students has access to appropriate resources seems to be an accident of birth—whether they are a part of a supportive and knowledgeable family or are residing in a community that has programs and opportunities available to them. ((ul))There are students in every demographic and in every school district((/ul)) in the United States ((ul))with enormous potential to become our future STEM leaders and to define the leading edge of scientific discovery and technological innovation((/ul)). Some of our Nation’s most talented students—perhaps through sheer individual will, good fortune, and circumstance—rise through the educational system and become leading contributors to the scientific workforce. Regrettably, ((ul))far too many of our most able students((/ul)) ((ul))are neither discovered nor developed, particularly those who have not had adequate access to educational resources, have not been inspired to pursue STEM, or who have faced numerous other barriers to achievement((/ul)). The possibility of reaching one’s potential should not be met with ambivalence, left to chance, or limited to those with financial means. Rather, the opportunity for excellence is a fundamental American value and should be afforded to all."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":85}},{"tag":"((hl))China is advancing over the US-- only the CP can solve hegemony.((/hl))","cite":"((hl))Evans, 18((/hl))","text":["(Gareth, PhD, writer for Army Technology, \"Is the US military machine losing its innovation edge to China?', March 29 https://www.army-technology.com/features/us-military-machine-losing-innovation-edge-china/ NL)","((ul))Innovation has been central to the US war machine since the end of WWII((/ul)), and, by implication, to the success of the rules-based system that has governed international relations over the same period too. American advances in nuclear weapons technology in the 1950s made possible the ‘first offset strategy’ nullifying the Soviet superiority in conventional numbers, and when Moscow narrowed the gap, heavy ‘second offset’ investment in emerging stealth and smart weapons technologies ensured the US lead remained through the 80s and 90s. But what of the decades since? US Secretary of Defense James Mattis, warned in his speech at John Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies on 19th January, “((ul))((hl))our competitive edge has eroded in every domain of warfare, air, land, sea, space and cyberspace, ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))and it is continuing to erode((/hl))((/ul)).” ((ul))There is a growing consensus that the once-unassailable US technological advantage is fast fading, and might even soon be ceded to one of its rivals, probably China((/ul)), in the course of renewed competition between ‘Great Powers’, the like of which the world has not seen for over half a century. On the face of it, it is hard to see why. The US has certainly not become any less innovative or technologically capable than either Russia or China; current Defense News data shows that the United States is home to no fewer than 15 of the world’s top 25 defence contractors, and according to Forbes, exactly the same holds true for technology companies too. The talent is evidently there – but this is a game as much about focus as capability, and US attention has been distracted. An era of distraction: the demands of asymmetric warfare In fairness, the Twin Towers was hardly an event to be simply ignored, but in launching its ‘War on Terror’, Washington suddenly and dramatically shifted focus onto a very different kind of adversary and the new and immediate demands of asymmetric warfare and counter-insurgency. “In launching its ‘War on Terror’, Washington shifted focus onto a very different kind of adversary.” At the same time ‘second offset’ technologies were proliferating around the world, resources that would otherwise have been allocated towards developing and cementing ‘third offset’ weapons, and capabilities to maintain military dominance, were instead expended in Iraq and Afghanistan. While the US focused on dismantling the terrorists’ networks, training camps and safe-havens, China steadily ramped up its defence investment and innovation, developing its own systems and technologies to equip its military for the 21stCentury, and potentially challenge American hegemony in the Pacific. ((ul))The irony is that, in many ways, the success of what Eisenhower dubbed the ‘military-industrial complex’((/ul)), a success that first helped the US to global pre-eminence in the first place, ((ul))has also brought about its current predicament. Could the model that seemed so right for so long, now be quite wrong?((/ul)) Consolidated dream teams and suffering competition “((ul))((hl))We cannot expect success fighting tomorrow’s conflicts with yesterday’s weapons or equipment((/hl))((/ul)),” Mattis told his audience at John Hopkins, and yet in essence that is often what the Department of Defense (DOD) does when it comes to technological innovation. The DOD development blueprint was well-honed for the era in which it was devised, but it is now increasingly beginning to look as if it has become outmoded. Big defence spending throughout the Cold War, followed by the huge consolidation of the US defence sector when both came to an end has left a legacy approach based on rigid requirements, and contracts aimed at the same small number of specialist contractors. In addition, the costs of the programmes are often so high that ‘dream teams’ of prime defence contractors, who should in theory be rivals, band together to bid for Pentagon projects. There are two big consequences. Firstly, ((ul))having spent so much on their development and procurement, the resulting systems are almost invariably forced to remain in service for many years((/ul)), albeit modified and upgraded, irrespective of changing needs and technological advances. Secondly, and ultimately more importantly, competition inevitably suffers, and without the need to compete, there is little incentive to take a risk and innovate. As Eisenhower put it in the same 1961 farewell speech that first introduced the term ‘military-industrial complex’ to the common lexicon, “a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity.” The economic paradox of the innovation deficit Economic factors play a major role too. While the US has the world’s largest defence expenditure in dollar terms, paradoxically many point to a lack of DOD spending as one of the key reasons for the nation’s growing innovation deficit. An important budgetary trend lies hidden in the high absolute numbers. ((ul))Since 2009, the US defence spend has fallen from 4.6% of GDP to just 3.3% today((/ul)), and although the latest figures from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute show that this decline has now been reversed, the fact remains that ((ul))GDP expenditure on R&D is ((/ul))((ul))less than half what it was thirty years ago.((/ul)) “Since 2009, the US defence spend has fallen from 4.6% of GDP to just 3.3% today.” For small-to-medium companies in the mid- and lower-tiers of the sector, that generates something of a crisis of commercial confidence when it comes to investing heavily in developing precisely the kinds of technologies that the Pentagon needs for the future. ((ul))The same is certainly not true in China, where innovation in the industry is booming((/ul)), creating the ideal conditions to incubate a talent pool for the future that is as competitive as it is inventive. It is hard to imagine that the two things are not related. However, it would be far too simplistic to suggest that it is simply all about government investment. If technology is to remain at the heart of the oft-quoted US ‘overmatch’, the DOD also needs to address changing marketplace realities and accept that with the huge expansion of global tech firms, defence contracts are now significantly less influential than they once were. ((ul))((hl))Putting it bluntly, ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))the Pentagon no longer has the deepest pockets in town((/hl))((/ul)). In the 2015 study ‘National Security Technology Accelerator: A Plan for Civil-Military Industry Innovation’ from New York University, the authors observed that “((ul))the emergence of international commercial and consumer high-tech markets over the past two decades has substantially displaced DOD as the centre of gravity for global R&D activity((/ul)).” It is for these markets that many of the cutting-edge technologies that the US military may one day come to depend on are being developed, not the traditional defence contract route. Reshaping relationships: Forging new commercial partnerships That does not automatically make for a tale of doom and gloom. The DOD has a long history of working successfully with the private sector, and some of today’s most profoundly important technologies, including the internet and GPS navigation, arose directly as a result, while many others have been significantly boosted by defence funded projects. Nevertheless, as Adam Jay Harrison, the National Security Technology Accelerator director, has pointed out, too many technology businesses – even some that have previously enjoyed DOD support – are now “turning their backs” on the Pentagon. The challenge is to re-forge and reshape the relationship between commercial technology companies and the military to make it fit for this century, not the last. “One path to more fully align civilian technology opportunities with the Defense enterprise is for DOD to radically rethink its approach to acquisition and industry engagement in a manner that is more consistent with commercial market norms,” the New York University study concludes. If it does not, then the risk of the US losing its long-standing innovative edge becomes very real indeed – and China is waiting."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":47}},{"tag":"((hl))The CP’s economic and military expansion is the only way to solve the advantage((/hl))","cite":"((hl))Burns, 14((/hl))","text":["(Nicholas Burns, Professor of the Practice of Diplomacy and International Politics at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government and former U.S. Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs What Washington Can Do to Revive Relations With New Delhi, Foreign Affairs, 00157120, Sep/Oct2014, Vol. 93, Issue 5)","In the century ahead, U.S. strategic interests will align more closely with India's than they will with those of any other continental power in Asia. The United States and India both seek to spread democracy, expand trade and investment, counter terrorism, and, above all, keep the region peaceful by balancing China's growing military power((ul)). As Washington expands its presence in Asia((/ul)) as part of the so-called pivot, ((ul))New Delhi will be a critical partner((/ul)). In the Asia-Pacific region, especially, India joins Australia, Japan, South Korea, and others in a U.S.-led coalition of democratic allies. And as the most powerful state in South Asia, India will exert a positive influence on a troubled Afghanistan, as well as on Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. The ((ul))Obama((/ul)) administration ((ul))should((/ul)) therefore use its remaining two years to ((ul))make India a greater priority,((/ul)) especially since the country has not yet figured prominently in the rebalancing of U.S. attention and resources to Asia.

((ul))((hl))That appearance of neglect((/hl))((/ul)), however fair or unfair, ((ul))((hl))has rankled Indian officials and eroded some of their tru((/hl))((/ul))((ul))st((/ul)) in Washington. With the election of a new government in New Delhi, the ((ul))Obama((/ul)) administration ((ul))has a chance to repair the relationship.((/ul)) In May, ((ul))Indians voted into office((/ul)) Narendra ((ul))Modi((/ul)), a Hindu nationalist from the western state of Gujarat ((ul))who has signaled((/ul)) that ((ul))he wants to build a more ambitious partnership((/ul)) with the United States. ((ul))That will happen ((/ul))((ul))only if((/ul))((ul)) Obama pushes India to the top of his foreign policy agenda((/ul)) and Modi implements a series of reforms to enable stronger economic and political ties between the two governments. The leaders are scheduled to hold their first meeting in Washington this September, and before they do, ((ul))both should begin thinking about rebuilding the((/ul)) U.S.-Indian ((ul))relationship in five key ways:((/ul)) ((ul))by expanding bilateral trade((/ul)), ((ul))strengthening military cooperation((/ul)), collaborating to combat threats to homeland security, stabilizing a post-American Afghanistan, ((ul))and((/ul)), especially, ((ul))finding greater common ground on transnational challenges ((/ul))such as climate change. It is an ambitious agenda, but ((ul))pursuing it would put India where it belongs: at the center of U.S. strategy in the region((/ul)). FALLING OUT Many Indian officials look back on the presidency of George W. Bush as a special moment in U.S.-Indian relations. From his first days in office, Bush made India a priority, arguing that its flourishing market economy, entrepreneurial drive, democratic system, and growing young population were crucial to U.S. aims in the region. He saw that the two countries, far from being strategic rivals, shared many of the same views on how power should be balanced in the twenty-first century. He believed that the United States had a clear interest in supporting India's rise as a global power. The results of his emphasis were dramatic. ((ul))The volume of trade in goods and services between the United States and India has more than tripled since 2004.((/ul)) Also since then, the two governments have dramatically strengthened their military ties and launched new cooperative projects on space, science and technology, education, and democratic governance. Bush also engineered one of the most important initiatives in the history of the U.S.-Indian relationship: the civil nuclear agreement, which for the first time permitted U.S. firms to invest in India's civil nuclear power sector. (I served as the lead American negotiator for the deal.) This agreement helped end India's nuclear isolation, allowing New Delhi to trade in civil nuclear technology even though it is not a party to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. In return, India opened up its civil nuclear industry for the first time to sustained international inspection. The agreement's real import, though, lay in its message to the Indian people: the United States took their country seriously and wanted to leave behind the previous decades of cool relations. More broadly, it was a signal of U.S. support for India's emerging global role. When Obama took office, he followed Bush's lead. After all, Bush's India policy had enjoyed rare and strong support from Democrats -- including then U.S. Senators Joseph Biden, Hillary Clinton, and Obama himself -- throughout his second term. In 2009, Obama hosted then Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his wife as the administration's first official state visitors. During his own successful state visit to New Delhi in 2010, Obama became the first U.S. president to endorse India's bid to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council. Yet despite this promising start, ((ul))Obama's India policy never hit full stride((/ul)). Although Clinton, as secretary of state, collaborated with New Delhi on development and women's issues, the administration was understandably preoccupied with the more urgent short-term crises it had inherited on taking office: the global financial meltdown, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the threat of a nuclear Iran. It was a classic Washington story of near-term crises crowding out long-term ambitions. As Obama's first term ended, India slid down Washington's priority list, and Indian officials complained privately about what they saw as a lack of attention from their American counterparts. To be fair to Obama, however, ((ul))the Indian government played an even greater role in the relationship's decline. ((/ul))In 2010, the Indian Parliament passed an ill-advised nuclear liability law that placed excessive responsibility on suppliers for accidents at nuclear power plants. The legislation, which gained support after the 25th anniversary of a horrific chemical spill at an American-owned plant in Bhopal, shattered investor confidence. By deterring U.S. and other firms from entering the Indian market, the law made implementation of the civil nuclear agreement impossible, undermining what should have been the centerpiece of the two countries' relationship. Washington and New Delhi haven't managed to resolve the impasse. The relationship suffered further when Indian economic growth slowed markedly in 2012 and 2013, depressing foreign investment, as the government, led by the Indian National Congress, was rocked by corruption allegations and failed to implement promised reforms in retail, insurance, energy, and infrastructure. New Delhi unwisely imposed discriminatory taxes on foreign investors and enacted protectionist measures that impeded trade. A series of bitterly fought U.S.-Indian trade disputes took center stage, overshadowing the political and military ties that had been the glue of the growing partnership and preventing the two countries from being able to strike any major new economic agreements. Then came two severe diplomatic tempests. Over the course of 2013, as Modi emerged as a front-runner in the upcoming election, the Indian press revived the story of Washington's earlier decision to bar Modi from entering the United States on the grounds that he had failed to suppress deadly anti-Muslim riots in 2002, when he was chief minister of Gujarat. Bush administration officials, including me, believed this to be the right decision at the time, but many Modi supporters charged that the visa ban was yet another example of American disregard for Indian dignity. Then, in December 2013, U.S. federal agents arrested Devyani Khobragade, India's deputy consul general in New York, for lying on her housekeeper's visa application, infuriating the Indian press and public. It was a perfect but avoidable storm. The United States should have handled the visa issue at the core of the dispute in private to avoid inflaming India's bruised ego, and the Indian government, which made matters worse by downgrading security at the U.S. embassy in New Delhi and refusing to renew teachers' visas at the American Embassy School, should have reacted more calmly. Instead, both governments fanned the flames, and anti-American furor dominated the news in India for weeks. ((ul))By early 2014, the collapse in confidence was all too visible, and this is what Obama and Modi must begin working to repair when they meet((/ul)). At the same time, U.S. Secretary of State John ((ul))Kerry((/ul)), Secretary of Defense Chuck ((ul))Hagel, and((/ul)) Secretary of the Treasury Jack ((ul))Lew must act((/ul)), in effect, ((ul))as project managers, steering the relationship past the inevitable obstacles((/ul)), just as then Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice did so capably in Bush's second term. ((ul))((hl))Top-down government leadership is essential to motivate the vast U.S. bureaucracy to put India back at the center of Washington's attentio((/hl))((/ul))((ul))n((/ul)). ((ul))Obama((/ul)), meanwhile, ((ul))will find a willing partner in Modi((/ul)). Remarkably, the prime minister has exhibited no public signs of resentment over the visa issue and, in a show of good faith, decided in May that he would visit Washington instead of insisting that Obama first visit New Delhi. Modi has already demonstrated himself to be an unusually strong Indian leader, who will use his executive authority in a more hands-on fashion than did "],"stats":{"highlightedWords":52}},{"tag":"((hl))Economic changes solve((/hl))","cite":"((hl))Burns, 14((/hl))","text":["(Nicholas Burns, Professor of the Practice of Diplomacy and International Politics at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government and former U.S. Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs What Washington Can Do to Revive Relations With New Delhi, Foreign Affairs, 00157120, Sep/Oct2014, Vol. 93, Issue 5)","((ul))IT'S THE ECONOMY, STUPID((/ul))","((ul))((hl))Obama should focus first on Modi's main priority: reviving the Indian econom((/hl))((/ul))((ul))y((/ul)).

The principle driving force of the media campaign is the traditional China-India rivalry, and its collective pitch is that OBOR is aimed at promoting an imperial Chinese dominance in East Asia, South Asia, and elsewhere. Of course, East Asia is China’s old stomping ground and, as a rising power, it is natural that Beijing would expand its sphere of influence. A more rational response for India in East Asia is to try and outbid China diplomatically and economically by creating small alliances of its own and by offering economic assistance through its own longstanding Look East strategy. Look East, however, has a problem: While it has long looked good on paper, the strategy has never been followed consistently or vigorously by successive Indian prime ministers. Pursuing mega-strategies has never been India’s wont, and in any case the country until recently has lacked the deep funds needed to throw money at Southeast Asian countries who have been sympathetic to India’s aspirations and who would have been happy recipients of its economic assistance. Under Modi things changed. He brought to office a strong desire to couch China-India ties as essentially competitive. But India’s political culture is not so quick to absorb changes of that magnitude. Indian bureaucracies are full of personnel who are deeply mired in the Nehruvian notion of vacuous moralism, which was deeply committed to non-alignment and never paid much attention to the Great Power politics of the 1950s and 1960s. This created a lot of hoopla during the Cold War years, but that hoopla no longer finds an audience, even within Third World countries in the 21st century. ((ul))While emphasizing the competitive nature of Indo-Chinese strategic ties, Modi also has made sure that his country continues to take advantage of China’s own interests in cultivating its economic ties with India((/ul)). This is a nuanced policy from the side of both Beijing and New Delhi. ((ul))As much as Sino-Indian strategic competition remained hot for the past several decades, neither New Delhi nor Beijing wanted to jeopardize their bilateral economic trade.((/ul)) Consequently, bilateral trade \"surged from under $3 billion in 2000 to nearly $52 billion in 2008)…. Even conservative estimates suggest that, by 2020, China-India trade could surpass last year’s US-China total of $409.2 billion and more than half of total projected US-China trade in 2020.\" As China continues to travel toward its goal of becoming the second superpower, it sees India as a challenger that should not be ignored for at least two reasons. First, India has managed to develop close strategic ties with the United States through the purchase of military weapons, the planning of joint military exercises, and the transfer of technology. India also aspires to become a member of the Nuclear Supply Group, after which it would likely become a serious competitor of China in the area of nuclear weapons development. That is one reason why China continues to veto India’s entry into that group, even while it leaves all doors of mutual economic cooperation wide open. China’s greatest success in gaining the upper hand over India is in its multifaceted strategic ties with Pakistan. ((ul))The emergence of a nuclear Pakistan((/ul)), in which China’s transfer of nuclear knowledge and blueprints of actual nuclear weapons designs played a major role, ((ul))tied down India’s own nuclear preparedness on two different fronts: China and Pakistan. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))What bothers India the most is the fact that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor has not only given Pakistan the promise of emergence as a major economic actor((/hl))((/ul)), but that the corridor passes through the disputed territory of Kashmir on the Pakistan border. It is reported that China tried to appease India by offering to change the name of the corridor through Pakistan; however, it dropped that suggestion after Pakistan protested. India’s major objection to the inclusion of the disputed territory was one explicit reason why it decided to boycott the OBOR summit. India’s neighbors are sold on President Xi’s sales pitch for OBOR, which he called the “project of the century,” and these states are poised to join it. Since poverty is the dominant issue throughout South Asia, ((ul))China’s promise that this program will tackle poverty makes a lot of sense to India’s neighbors. India says that promise is mere hype. But as Western-oriented globalization continues to hurt their economies through high unemployment and rising inflation, most poverty-stricken countries of the Third World have started to envision OBOR as a source of economic assistance and financial relief((/ul)). Another Indian criticism depicts OBOR as imperialistic in nature. As one of the main leaders of the non-aligned movement of the Cold War years, India still presumes itself to be a rightful actor to question China’s motives regarding its role as the rising economic power of the 21st Century. However, as another rising economic power of Asia, and an actor that emulates China’s policies of seeking alliances and offering economic assistance to several countries, India is open to like criticism from Beijing. And China never fails to remind the world that, as a former victim of imperialistic policies and occupation by the West and Japan, it has remained firmly opposed to such policies. The global hubs of economic activities -- places such as New York, London, and Berlin -- are likely to have new additions including Beijing and Shanghai. India, meanwhile, has not been able to find an equally promising way to counter OBOR. So, it is left with flimsy excuses (flimsy in the sense that they find no global supportive audience) like criticizing that strategy because it involves the disputed territory of Kashmir that is under Pakistani administration. In all likelihood, through OBOR, the Chinese view of the hierarchy of nations and the pecking order of nation-states is likely to change. ((ul))Despite all of the criticisms of its potential complications and its chances for failure, and ((/ul))((ul))((hl))India’s related suspicion of China’s ulterior motives, OBOR carries with it the ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))enormous economic power((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) of China and an ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))equally powerful resolve by its leadership((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) to make it a success((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) Even the United States and Japan realize that and are likely to remain involved in it without joining it, for now. India might be well-advised to revise its own refusal to join.

When Ms. McLorg walked into the hotel lobby to meet Mr. Mohammad and his wife, Eman, she had a letter to explain how sponsorship worked: ((ul))For one year, Ms. McLorg and her group would provide financial and practical support((/ul)), from subsidizing food and rent to supplying clothes to helping them learn English and find work. ((ul))She and((/ul)) her ((ul))partners((/ul)) had ((ul))already raised more than 40,000 Canadian dollars((/ul)) (about $30,700), ((ul))selected an apartment, talked to the local school and found a((/ul)) nearby ((ul))mosque((/ul)). Ms. McLorg, the mother of two teenagers, made her way through the crowded lobby, a kind of purgatory for newly arrived Syrians. Another member of the group clutched a welcome sign she had written in Arabic but then realized she could not tell if the words faced up or down. When the Mohammads appeared, Ms. McLorg asked their permission to shake hands and took in the people standing before her, no longer just names on a form. Mr. Mohammad looked older than his 35 years. His wife was unreadable, wearing a flowing niqab that obscured her face except for a narrow slot for her eyes. Their four children, all under 10, wore donated parkas with the tags still on. For the Mohammads, who had been in Canada less than 48 hours, the signals were even harder to read. In Syria, Abdullah had worked in his family’s grocery stores and Eman had been a nurse, but after three years of barely hanging on in Jordan, they were not used to being wanted or welcomed. “You mean we’re leaving the hotel?” Abdullah asked. To himself, he was wondering, “What do these people want in return?” ((ul))Much of the world is reacting to the refugee crisis — 21 million displaced((/ul)) from their countries, ((ul))nearly five million of them Syrian((/ul)) — ((ul))with ((/ul))((ul))hesitation or hostility((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) ((ul))Greece shipped desperate migrants back((/ul)) to Turkey; ((ul))Denmark confiscated((/ul)) their ((ul))valuables((/ul)); and even ((ul))Germany((/ul)), which ((ul))has((/ul)) accepted more than half a million refugees, is struggling with ((ul))growing resistance((/ul)) to them.

((ul))Trump((/ul)), the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has ((ul))called for temporary bans on all Muslims((/ul)) from entering the country ((ul))and((/ul)) recently ((ul))warned that Syrian refugees would cause “big problems in the future.”((/ul)) The Obama administration promised to take in 10,000 Syrians by Sept. 30 but has so far admitted about half that many. Just ((ul))across the border((/ul)), however, ((ul))the Canadian government can barely keep up with((/ul)) the ((ul))demand to welcome them((/ul)). Many volunteers felt called to action by the photograph of ((ul))Alan Kurdi, the Syrian toddler whose body washed up((/ul)) last fall on a Turkish beach. He had only a slight connection to Canada — his aunt lived near Vancouver — but his death ((ul))caused recrimination so strong it helped elect an idealistic, refugee-friendly prime minister,((/ul)) Justin ((ul))Trudeau((/ul)). The Toronto Star greeted the first planeload by splashing “Welcome to Canada” in English and Arabic across its front page. Eager sponsors toured local Middle Eastern supermarkets to learn what to buy and cook and used a toll-free hotline for instant Arabic translation. Impatient would-be sponsors — “an angry mob of do-gooders,” The Star called them — have been seeking more families. ((ul))((hl))The new government committed to taking in 25,000 Syrian refugees and then raised the total by tens of thousands. “I can’t provide refugees fast enough for all the Canadians who want to sponsor them,” John McCallum, the country’s immigration minister, said in an interview((/hl))((/ul)). In the ideal version of private sponsorship, the groups become concierges and surrogate family members who help integrate the outsiders, called “New Canadians.” The hope is that the Syrians will form bonds with those unlike them, from openly gay sponsors to business owners who will help them find jobs to lifelong residents who will take them skating and canoeing. Ms. McLorg’s group of neighbors and friends includes doctors, economists, a lawyer, an artist, teachers and a bookkeeper. Advocates for sponsorship believe that private citizens can achieve more than the government alone, raising the number of refugees admitted, guiding newcomers more effectively and potentially helping solve the puzzle of how best to resettle Muslims in Western countries. ((ul))Some advocates((/ul)) even ((ul))talk about extending the Canadian system across the globe((/ul)).

Despite major world events — from the global recession, terrorist attacks, increasing tensions with North Korea and growing frustration with Western governments — Canadians’ opinions have remained mostly consistent.

At the same time, 25 per cent of respondents think ((ul))the most important contribution the country can make to the world is accepting immigrants and multiculturalism((/ul)), a shift from ten years ago when peacekeeping topped the list. The Discourse partnered with Environics to gain early access to the findings of the Canada’s World Survey. After combing through the data, we want to dig deeper into what Canadians think about welcoming refugees. How Canadians feel about refugees. Amea Wilbur, training manager at the Pacific Immigrant Resources Society (PIRS) in Vancouver, says she felt a shift in attitude over the last two years with the influx of would-be volunteers contacting her team. “((ul))I really saw ((/ul))((ul))((hl))when t((/hl))((/ul))((ul))he ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Syrians came((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))people really stepped up((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).

Drawing from what the respondents said, the survey estimates that ((ul))((hl))two million adult Canadians were involved directly in the sponsorship of refugees((/hl))((/ul)), with another seven million who knew someone who did. Seven per cent of the Canada’s World Survey respondents said they had direct involvement with welcoming refugees while 25 per cent said they know someone who did. Francisco Rico-Martinez, co-director of the FCJ Refugee Centre in Toronto, isn’t surprised at those numbers — but what he really wants to know is if Canadians are building meaningful relationships. It has to go beyond getting together for tacos, he laughs((ul)). “We need to create a more fair society for everyone.”((/ul)) For him, that means not just recognizing multiculturalism but also practicing it in our justice system, social services and economic opportunities. ((ul))“We have to build a society that is more inclusive even now — that is creating more equality [and] more justice.”((/ul)) And while Canada may be a role model for other countries, Rico-Martinez says ((ul))it “needs to be a more aggressive role model” that fights for social equality((/ul)). Should Canada do more to help the global refugee crisis. Yasmin Ullah, a 26-year-old Rohingya woman, recalls her journey to Canada as a refugee from Myanmar. “There are so many willing people to help, willing to give — it’s incredible,” she says. Over half a million Rohingya, a stateless Muslim minority, have fled Myanmar since conflict escalated there in 2017. Ullah’s family escaped to northern Thailand when she was three years old. They lived there for years while trying to find a way through the international asylum system, relying on fake identification. Eventually, she says, she, her brother and father were privately sponsored by church groups and came to Canada in June 2011. Today, all three are Canadian citizens living in Surrey, B.C. “The first thing I wanted to do in Canada was get back on my feet,” says Ullah, who now works at a dental office while balancing political science courses at Kwantlen Polytechnic University and Rohingya advocacy work.

Moreover, ((ul))((hl))Congress appears to have provided the government with broad authority to provide work authorization to((/hl))((/ul)) just about ((ul))any non-citizen((/ul)).12 It is undeniably true that more EAD and Parole benefits will be of limited value to retrogressed non-citizens from India and China who are already in the US in the employment-based second and third preferences. After all, most have an H-1B and can extend under Section 106(a) or Section 104(c) of AC 21, but as noted previously, some may still not be able to take advantage of AC 21. The EAD in itself will not have a portability benefit. The foreign national will still need to intend to work for the sponsoring employer even if he/she is using the EAD for open market employment. This reservation, valid as it undoubtedly is, focuses only on those already here. It speaks solely to past migration flows not to future ones. ((ul))((hl))For future flows, this will supplement the H-1B by giving employers of foreign nationals another option. No longer will the constant controversy over the H-1B quota discredit all employment-based immigratio((/hl))((/ul))((ul))n ((/ul))in the eyes of its critics and, most importantly, in the court of public opinion.

Beyond that, ((ul))it is ((/ul))manifestly ((ul))not true to argue that((/ul)) ((ul))all ((/ul))of our ((ul))immigration needs ((/ul))can ((ul))be solved with more H1B numbers. ((/ul))This will not work for those who are not H1B material. It will not work for those with essential skills but find themselves in the \"Other Worker\" backlog under INA Section 203(b)(3)(iii) with no hope of getting the green card any time soon. It will not eliminate the need to legalize the undocumented.

The Executive would not be granting the undocumented legal status for that is what only Congress can do. But, like adjustment of status itself, ((ul))the Executive certainly can create a period of stay that permits the undocumented to remain here. While those out of status or who entered without inspection should not receive employment authorization on a retroactive basis, there is no reason in law or logic why the Executive cannot grant parole on a nunc pro tunc basis.((/ul))13 Leaving aside the troubling question of whether such a policy change would not reward conduct that violates the law, the retroactive EAD would only cure the unauthorized employment problem but not the overstay or unlawful presence problem. The 3/10 year bar14 is not triggered by a violation of status resulting from unauthorized employment but an overstay past the I-94 validity. For this reason, a retroactive EAD would do nothing to ameliorate the crushing harshness of the 3/10 year bar, though it might restore eligibility in some situations to adjust by avoiding the unauthorized employment preclusion of INA 245(c).15 What would cure the prior unlawful presence would be a retroactive granting of parole. Look at the definition of \"unlawful presence\" in INA 212 (a)(9)(B)(ii). It speaks of being \"present in the United States after the expiration of the period of stay authorized by the Attorney General or is present in the United States without being admitted or paroled.\" So, ((ul))((hl))if you are present in the USA on parole, you are not accumulating any unlawful presence.((/hl))((/ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((ul))((hl))You can grant retroactive parole without overriding the will of Congress.

Moreover, the ((ul))INA permits immigration officials to waive certain statutory restrictions that might otherwise render an alien ineligible to receive particular immigration benefits((/ul)).

For example, immigration officials may opt to give a lower priority to the removal of certain categories of unlawfully present aliens because the removal of other categories (e.g., those convicted of serious crimes) has been deemed a higher priority in light of resource constraints and other considerations.16 Congressional enactments could, however, be seen as limiting the executive’s discretion not to take particular actions (e.g., by mandating that certain aliens be detained pending removal proceedings).17 The express adoption of an executive policy that is “in effect an abdication of ... statutory duty” could also be found to be impermissible,18 but ((ul))((hl))it might be difficult for a court to assess the degree of nonenforcement that would entail an “abdication((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)).”((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) The executive branch’s discretion to interpret applicable statutes ((/ul))((ul))((hl))when Congress has not spoken to the precise question at issue may also afford immigration officials some flexibility in determining how INA requirements apply to a particular alien or category of alien((/hl))((/ul))((ul))s((/ul)).19 This discretion may be relevant in determining how particular statutory grants of discretionary authority are to be applied (e.g., what constitutes “exceptional and extremely unusual hardship” for purposes of cancellation of removal, or “extreme hardship” for purposes of certain waivers of inadmissibility).20 It can also play a role in determining whether and how particular statutes are seen to circumscribe the Executive’s enforcement discretion.

Global Brain Drain","The phenomenon of international brain drain is based on two premises: there are few highly educated people in developing nations,  [*936]  and those highly educated people are extremely likely to emigrate. n58 It is defined as a \"significant loss of the highly educated population\" resulting in negative economic effects in the sending country. n59 These negative effects are often twofold, including a loss of human capital as well as a loss of the government's return on its investment in its citizenry. n60 For example, a developing country may invest significant amounts of money in educating and providing healthcare to its youths on the understanding that they will mature into informed, healthy, and productive members of the national society. n61 That understanding collateralizes the investment. n62 Whenever a highly skilled, highly educated citizen emigrates, the country enters a loss on its ledger.","((ul))((hl))Although it is understandable that the best and brightest of a developing nation emigrate for a better life and additional opportunities, this ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))strips the sending nation((/hl))((/ul)) (perhaps more aptly described as the deprived nation) ((ul))((hl))of valuable resources necessary for continuing development((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) In this regard, ((ul))African countries have been acutely affected, and widespread emigration from the continent ((/ul))((ul))\"((/ul))((ul))((hl))threatens Africa with yet another net loss of quality human resources\" similar to the effect of the slave trade((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) n63 ((ul))One scholar estimates that twenty to fifty percent of the \"top African brains and skilled personnel\" have left the continent and fail to retain significant professional ties with their homelands.((/ul)) n64 The 2005 World Migration Report, compiled by the International Organization for Migration, called attention to the loss of human resources from the continent, a trend which one scholar predicts will culminate in Africa's transformation into an \"intellectually barren ghetto.\" n65","By contrast, developed countries benefit greatly from this continual injection of brains and talent, and they even compete with each other over immigrant candidates. n66 As Professor Ayelet Shachar, of  [*937]  the law faculty at the University of Toronto, explains, \"industrial countries are trying to outbid one another ... to attract highly skilled migrants to their domestic industries in order to gain (or retain) a relative advantage over their international competitors in the knowledge-based global economy.\" n67 From this perspective, encouraging highly skilled immigration becomes yet another strategy in the broad reach of a developed country's economy. n68 Reflecting upon this conceptualization of the immigrant as human capital, Professor Kunal M. Parker, of Cleveland-Marshall College of Law, aptly concludes that receiving countries measure the value of an aspiring immigrant based on her profile as \"homo oeconomicus.\" n69 Thus, brain drain is the inevitable symptom of a widespread \"reimagination of legal immigration in terms of productivity, skill, resources, and self-sufficiency.\" n70","((ul))The((/ul)) ((ul))U((/ul))nited ((ul))S((/ul))tates ((ul))is the most popular destination country for skilled immigrants((/ul)), n71 and it is easy to imagine why. The nation boasts expansive opportunities for the well-educated and highly skilled, and its immigration policies reward such a showing of talent. Admittedly, arguments appealing to international concerns often do not fare well in shaping U.S. laws. n72 U.S. immigration law is, without illusion, designed with the goal of furthering U.S. interests. n73 Critics of U.S. immigration policy have often urged an even stronger preferencing of  [*938]  elite immigrants rather than tempering the meritocracy. n74 This position is understandable and in no sense irrational from either a legal or policy perspective; after all, the United States was arguably founded on the ideas that social mobility was possible and that hard work and high achievement would be rewarded. n75","((ul))((hl))Brain drain((/hl))((/ul)) is detrimental, however, even with purely domestic goals in mind: it ((ul))((hl))directly undercuts U.S. foreign policy regarding global development and democracy promotion and also subverts border control policy aimed at reducing unauthorized entrie((/hl))((/ul))((ul))s((/ul)). The United States Agency for International Development (\"USAID\") states its \"twofold purpose\" as \"furthering America's foreign policy interests in expanding democracy and free markets while improving the lives of the citizens of the developing world.\" n76 It is the main U.S. governmental agency charged with promoting economic and democracy development around the globe. n77 USAID is not unaware of the benefits and detriments of brain drain. In a presentation to USAID on the relationship between migration and development, the Migration Policy Institute emphasized the \"potential [domestic] benefits of a 'brain export' industry,\" while at the same time acknowledging that efforts to repatriate such highly skilled immigrants - and thus mitigate the negative effects in sending countries - have generally failed. n78","[*939]  ((ul))Although remittances by highly skilled and highly educated migrants may contribute to economic development in sending countries, it is harder to assert that these remittances similarly contribute to democracy promotion((/ul)), which has become a prominent focus of USAID policy since 2002. n79 ((ul))Democracy((/ul)), especially in contrast to other forms of governance, ((ul))requires a certain financial stability and economic security in governmental entities((/ul)); the populace relies on the state to provide healthcare, educate the nation's youth, and, at least to some extent, redistribute wealth. n80 ((ul))Democratic governments must also exercise self-determination over their economic policies, a significant feat in the current international political economy.((/ul)) n81 ((ul))The infrastructure and bureaucratic capabilities necessary to accomplish these stepping stones to democracy rely on an educated, informed citizenry((/ul))((ul)), which must fill the roles of leaders and constituencies.((/ul)) ((ul))Promoting \"brain export\" hardly seems consistent with promoting democracy, and, therefore, the ((/ul))((ul))U((/ul))nited ((ul))S((/ul))tates ((ul))impairs its own global policy goals with its domestic immigration law((/ul)). n82","((ul))Border control policy is also underserved by an EB immigration system that engenders brain drain. Immigration is often motivated by a lack of employment and economic opportunity in the home country((/ul)), n83 ((ul))and the current allocation of EB-3 visas serves only a fraction of aspiring EB-3 immigrants.((/ul)) n84 Although the intent behind these statutory restrictions is likely to recalibrate the nature of the immigrant  [*940]  flow, n85 the result is a near trainwreck of supply and demand curves. ((ul))Rather than abandoning all intention of emigrating and remaining in their home countries, immigrants who would otherwise be EB-3s are more likely to violate border policies and pursue U.S. employment opportunities outside of the law.((/ul)) n86","EB immigration law largely attempts to restrict entry to all but the most elite, but the policy carries significant negative externalities. ((ul))By extracting the highly educated and highly skilled from nations around the globe, it ((/ul))((ul))stifles international development((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) Thus, ((ul))populations remain relatively unskilled and opportunities in sending countries remain limited.

Yet it’s also true that, in the last few years, we’ve talked a ton about state issues. Voter ID laws, abortion restrictions, minimum wage hikes, legalized marijuana, gun control, LGBT rights — each of these is an exhaustively covered example of state politics. In 2016, then, the most interesting thing about our state politics is how these two strands, the everyday and the ideological, intersect. State politicians are becoming more partisan and more polarized, much like national politicians. But this party-driven approach isn’t just influencing left-right issues like abortion or guns. It’s spreading through every part of state government, with surprising and potentially troubling results. It’s why Fairview’s water pipes haven’t been fixed — for reasons that have little to do with water, oil or even Montana itself. Before we dive into the states and their political divide, allow me a bipartisan caveat. The examples I’m highlighting will center on Republicans, because Republicans have become more extreme at the state level, just like at the national level, and because state Republicans are cleaning up: The GOP currently controls 68 of 981 state legislative chambers and 31 of the 50 governorships. One can imagine a future where Democrats create a similar ruckus. But for now, most state policies come from Republicans.

If you live in Connecticut, for instance, you’d need to steal $2,000 worth of goods for it to count as a felony; cross over to Massachusetts and that threshold drops to $250. With more serious crimes, the state you live in can determine whether you’re eligible for post-conviction DNA analysis or even for the death penalty. ((ul))The state you live in determines whether you can request a physician-assisted suicide. It can determine how long you stay on food stamps; it can determine the type of fireworks you buy((/ul)). The state you live in determines whether your teenager receives abstinence-only sex education; it also determines whether the teenager driving in the other lane is allowed to text in the car. Although some of these policies are divisive, far more are essential and mundane. In fact, for each new law Congress passes, states pass more than 75 of their own. Those laws loom even larger when we remember that fewer and fewer Americans move. According to the 2010 American Community Survey, six in ten Americans were born in their current state of residence.

Take Georgia, a longtime red state that for a while seemed like it might turn purple or even blue with Donald Trump on the GOP ticket.

The best place to see this is in the research of Steven Rogers, a political scientist at St. Louis University who specializes in state legislatures. ((ul))Rogers has analyzed decades of data across dozens of states((/ul)). He’s tested various factors to see how they might influence voters: ((ul))the state’s economy, tax rates, homicide rate and student reading scores, among others((/ul)).

The proportion of seats a party wins in the U.S. House overlaps to an uncanny degree with the proportion of seats it wins in the state houses, and this national-local link stretches back to World War I. In other words, ((ul))((hl))it’s not just that((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) most ((/ul))((ul))((hl))voters ignore((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) what’s happening at ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the state level((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))— it’s that ((ul))((hl))they’ve ignored it for a century((/hl))((/ul)) or more. The problem is that while the voting patterns haven’t changed, the national parties have. What’s happened to the national parties is a bleak and well-known story: Washington, D.C. has become more extreme, more polarized and more driven by negative partisanship. Now that partisanship is oozing into state capitals. For most of the 20th century, state government remained plodding and traditional, animated more by fixing problems than by prosecuting beliefs.2 Voters saw little difference when electing Democrats or Republicans, state by state, and most of the big policy changes came from the federal government (the New Deal) or the courts (Brown v. Board of Education). Together, the states drifted slowly to the left, helped by steadily increasing federal grants. In the 1980s and 1990s, though, state politics changed. Recently, political scientists have started to build tools that analyze trends at the state level. One team has compiled thousands of legislative votes and used them to track changes in the ideology of state legislatures, similar to what DW-NOMINATE does for Congress. Another team has assembled a data set of nearly 150 individual policies and used it to chart each state’s policy outcomes since 1936. These tools make it possible to compare states to each other and to their past selves, and in both cases it’s clear that over the last couple of decades states and their legislators have become more ideologically consistent and more ideologically extreme. For the first time in modern state politics, Republican governments started passing mostly conservative agendas, and Democratic governments started passing mostly liberal agendas. No one is quite sure why polarization and partisanship are rising at the state level, just like no one’s quite sure at the national level. But some state and local politicians started cribbing their national parties’ tactics and rhetoric. Sarah Palin, for example, ran to be a small-town mayor in 1996 before she was a governor and vice presidential nominee. When she ran for the top job in Wasilla, Alaska, the most pressing local issues were paving dirt roads and creating a police department. Yet Palin campaigned on national issues, with mailers that highlighted her anti-abortion-rights stance and ads that proclaimed she was “Endorsed by the NRA.” ((ul))But there’s one key difference between the states and D.C. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))At the national level, gridlock has slowed both sides. In((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))states((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), where voters and legislators are more clearly sorted, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))there’s((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) often ((/ul))((ul))((hl))less obstruction((/hl))((/ul)). Money and energy have moved to the states. ((ul))Legislatures are getting more lobbyists((/ul)). (Mylan, the infamous EpiPen manufacturer, upped the number of states it lobbied from nine to 45 in a four-year span.) States have attracted more partisan outfits, as well. More than 1,000 state legislators have signed the state version of Grover Norquist’s “no taxes” pledge. State reps now go to the floor and read NRA talking points verbatim. The American Legislative Exchange Council, which pushes pro-business “model bills” in statehouses around the country, seems stronger than ever. ((ul))((hl))Because this((/hl))((/ul)) activity ((ul))((hl))is happening((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) in the states((/ul)), ((ul))((hl))it gets less scrutiny from((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))media and((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) less attention from ((/ul))((ul))((hl))voters((/hl))((/ul)). But there’s no question that our states are changing. While both sides are becoming more extreme, state Republicans are moving further to the right than state Democrats are moving to the left. According to the DW-NOMINATE-style tool, 18 state legislatures are now more conservative than Congress, some of them drastically so.

For instance, ((ul))instead of holding a campaign-style victory event on Thursday, he met with families impacted by the opioid crisis in the White House’s East Room((/ul)). ((ul))((hl))That disconnect between the President’s enthusiasm and local lawmakers’((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) micro-level hesitancy ((/ul))((ul))((hl))has been on display before. ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))On((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) questions such as repealing ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Obamacare((/hl))((/ul)) and building a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border, many from the President’s own party balked. For instance, ((ul))((hl))Senators from states with thousands of constituents with((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) health ((/ul))((ul))((hl))coverage((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) because of the health care law ((/ul))((ul))((hl))weren’t eager to toss them from programs((/hl))((/ul)). And border-state Senators, like Jeff Flake and John McCain, understood a brick-and-mortar garrison along the southern border spelled bad politics back home. Heading into next week, the President may again find his agenda stymied by parochial interests, and not just on the tax proposals. The Senate Banking Committee is scheduled to take up the nomination of Scott Garrett to lead the Export-Import Bank, an economic powerhouse that helps U.S. manufacturers looking to sell their goods abroad. Critics from across the spectrum have faulted the New Deal relic as corporate cronyism and a handout to some of the nation’s biggest corporations. Trump was a critic of the institution as a candidate. He called it “featherbedding” during the campaign. “When you think about free enterprise, it’s not really free enterprise,” Trump said at the time. Then, after meeting with CEOs who rely on Ex-Im funding for sales abroad, he switched gears and nominated Garrett. Allies said he saw the big picture beyond the slagging the bank took in conservative press and on Twitter. The nominee, a former Congressman from New Jersey, is no fan of the institution he has been tapped to lead. (In fact, it’s a common trait within the Cabinet, as this week’s TIME Magazine reports in its cover story.) The pick brought groans from throughout the Senate because it either gave new life to the institution or issued its death warrant depending on where one sat. Should Garrett hobble the bank or leave it impotent, that could cost jobs for states with major manufacturers who use its powers. For instance, Republican Sen. Tim Scott represents South Carolina, where Boeing has a huge footprint. Scott has a seat on the Banking Committee, where Republicans have only a one-seat advantage. It won’t be an easy week for Scott as he considers an institution that House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling of Texas routinely calls “the Bank of Boeing.” Scott, for instance, has faced lobbying to reject that nomination, especially from the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce and other groups that benefit from Boeing’s economic power in the state. The National Association of Manufacturers also has run ads urging Scott to ditch Garrett. Yet, if Scott rejects Garrett, the bank stays in neutral and Boeing loses out. The Ex-Im bank’s board has lacked a quorum since 2015, meaning it can’t cut deals worth more than $10 million. If backers of the lending organization want it to get back to work, lawmakers need to confirm Garrett. But in doing so, they’re installing someone who has railed against the institution’s very mission. Complicating politics further has been a concerted effort among groups on the left to highlight earlier comments attributed to Garrett about LGBT rights. Some of Garrett’s potential supporters were left uneasy about elevating him to the new role and giving tacit endorsement of comments, some of which he said were misattributed or misconstrued. That record has made Democrats less willing to hold their nose in order to revive the bank.

Voters have cast their ballots on topics ranging from same-sex marriage and gambling to education, energy, election reform, and taxes. Eminent domain, the minimum wage, abortion, government finances, and animal rights were other subjects that occupied voters’ attention. This study focuses on four issue areas, most of which were considered in multiple states and targeted federal policy either by responding to perceived inaction or by challenging federal law. The Minimum Wage Until the newly elected Democratic Congress tackled the issue in early 2007, the federal government had not enacted a minimum wage increase since 1997, when it was raised to five dollars and fifteen cents an hour. Not content to wait for the federal government to act on what they perceived to be an important issue, in 2006 voters in six states (Nevada, Arizona, Ohio, Colorado, Missouri, and Montana) ratified initiatives to increase the minimum wage and index it to inflation, in some cases overwhelmingly. Eleven state legislatures approved raises in 2006 as well. The average ‘‘yes’’ vote for the 2006 ballot measures was 66 percent, and the average margin of victory was thirty-one points. In 2004, voters in Florida and Nevada overwhelmingly supported minimum wage ballot measures. In total, the National Conference of State Legislatures (2007b) reports that thirty states and the District of Columbia have adopted state minimum wages that are higher than the federal minimum wage. Clearly, despite inaction at the federal level there is much support for raising the minimum wage among both state voters and elected officials, including Democratic and some Republican governors and legislators. The ballot presence of hot-button issues such as same-sex marriage and the minimum wage has led scholars to investigate the mobilizing effects of these issues (Abramowitz 2004; Smith 2006; Nicholson 2005) and to uncover evidence of initiatives’ educative and electoral spillover effects. Smith and Tolbert, among the first to study the educative effects of direct democracy, found that initiative use is associated with increases in voter turnout, civic engagement, political interest, and political knowledge (Tolbert and Smith 2006; Smith and Tolbert 2004). Smith and Tolbert (2001), Kousser and McCubbins (2005), and others document the spillover effects of ballot initiatives on broader electoral and political processes such as citizens’ voting behavior in candidate elections and political party and interest group strategies. Smith (2006) notes that political officials (such as Arnold Schwarzenegger) and party operatives have skillfully used the initiative process to advance their policy agendas, threaten the legislature into action, and frame candidate elections. Smith, DeSantis, and Kassel (2006) find a positive correlation between support for anti-same-sex marriage measures and the vote for George W. Bush in Ohio and Michigan in 2004. Kousser and McCubbins (2005) describe how Democratic party activists in Colorado helped sponsor a successful 2004 initiative to increase mass transit funding that contributed to high voter turnout and Democratic victories in an election when Republican candidates dominated in many other states. In a wide-ranging study, Nicholson (2005) finds that ballot measures have agenda-setting, priming, and electoral spillover effects, altering the weight voters assign to various issues, the standards by which they evaluate candidates for congressional and gubernatorial offices, and the strategies of political candidates and parties. No longer the exclusive domain of citizens or interest groups, political party organizations, candidates, and elected officials now use initiative elections for many purposes: To increase voter registration and turnout, advance their political agendas and ideologies, circumvent contribution and expenditure limits in candidate races, selectively mobilize support for their own candidates, prime vote choice for issues on which they believe they have an advantage, or drive a wedge in opponent coalitions (Smith 2005, 2006; Kousser and McCubbins 2005; Smith and Tolbert 2001). As candidates and parties seek initiative success for policy or ideological reasons, they also force their opponents to drain their resources in attempting to defeat initiatives that run counter to their own policy and political goals. The minimum wage ballot measures that experienced overwhelming success in 2004 and 2006 were part of a concerted effort by progressive activists to mobilize sympathetic voters and sway candidate elections. Support for Florida’s 2004 minimum wage initiative by the Association of Community Organization for Reform Now (ACORN) led to the adoption of the measure as well as a successful voter registration drive. The group appeared to achieve its goals of ‘‘‘driving heightened Democratic turnout, passing the initiative, and building permanent political capacity for future gains’’’ (quoted in Kousser and McCubbins 2005, 973). In 2004 progressive activists in Nevada and Florida, with the approval of the Democratic National Committee, used focus groups and pre-election surveys to pretest the language of a variety of minimum wage proposals. They selected those they believed would mobilize low-income voters who would also support Democratic candidates, including presidential nominee John Kerry (Smith 2006). In 2006, the belief that minimum wage ballot initiatives could mobilize Democratic-leaning voters was an attractive possibility for labor unions (particularly the AFL-CIO, which launched its ‘‘America Needs a Raise’’ campaign that year) and other progressive groups such as ACORN interested in unseating the Republican congressional leadership (Broder 2006; Andrews 2006). The objectives of minimum wage sponsors, then, were manifold, including bringing about both state and federal policy change, boosting voter registration and turnout, and influencing candidate elections. Even before they appeared on state ballots and in Congress, ((ul))proposals to increase the minimum wage received high levels of support in public opinion polls((/ul)) (Roper Center 2007, 55). Democrats in Congress are certainly more sympathetic to a minimum wage increase than are most Republicans, and it is not surprising that they would choose to address the issue as one of their signature initiatives in the 110th Congress in early 2007. Still, the evidence presented here suggests that supporters of raising the minimum wage were able to simultaneously achieve three objectives: ((ul))((hl))Advocates took ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))independent state-level action((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) to address a policy issue of public concern((/ul)); they had a hand in helping to bring about an electoral majority in Congress more favorable to increasing the minimum wage; and their efforts led to increased turnout (if not Democratic victories) in at least some of the states where the measures appeared. ((ul))As predicted, the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))success((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) of minimum wage initiatives ((/ul))((ul))((hl))in((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) multiple ((/ul))((ul))((hl))states((/hl))((/ul)) during the 2004–2006 election cycle ((ul))((hl))ultimately resulted in((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) intergovernmental policy ((/ul))((ul))((hl))consensus.

((/ul))((ul))((hl))However((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), some evidence suggests that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))state((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) voters and ((/ul))((ul))((hl))policymakers, and not federal((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) lawmakers, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))receive((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) most of ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the credit((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))for((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) policy ((/ul))((ul))((hl))innovations that ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))originate at the state level((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)).

More importantly, the critiques do not stain the Court's distinction between state and federal citizenship.","In Boyd v.

Nevertheless, in so holding, the Court had occasion to reaffirm and opine at length regarding the separate and autonomous political systems of the federal and state governments, the distinct statuses of state and federal citizenship, and each government's respective supremacy within its own realm. 80","Similarly, in Colgate v. Harvey, the Court again addressed the scope of the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, this time as it applied to a state tax scheme that treated certain economic activity differently depending on whether it occurred within or outside the state.81 In the course of its decision, and in explaining the distinction between the Privileges and Immunities Clauses of Article IV and of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Court again reaffirmed the distinct and separate character of the citizenship schemes of the state and federal governments. 82","((ul))((hl))The enduring power of states to define the boundaries of their own political community has also been reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in the modem era((/hl))((/ul)).

How do we balance the constitutionally assigned powers of Congress against the constitutionally protected sovereignty of the states?((/ul)) 94 To understand the constraints on federal power in this realm we must first understand the purpose behind the federalist structure guaranteed by the Constitution.9 5 As the Supreme Court has explained, federalism \"preserves to the people numerous advantages\":","[1] It assures a decentralized government that will be more sensitive to the diverse needs of a heterogenous society; [2) it increases opportunity for citizen involvement in democratic processes; [3] it allows for more innovation and experimentation in government; and [4] it makes government more responsive by putting the States in competition for a mobile citizenry.","As an initial matter, it is worth noting that ((ul))((hl))it is difficult to imagine a state initiative more closely aligned with these values than the contemplated inclusive state citizenship schemes.((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) Extending state citizenship to immigrants is, of course, an \"innovati[ve] and experimentati[ve]\" initiative intended to make government \"more sensitive to the diverse needs of a heterogenous society,\" and \"((/ul))((ul))((hl))it increases opportunity for citizen involvement in democratic processes((/hl))((/ul))((ul))\" while putting \"States in competition for a mobile citizenry.\"((/ul)) 97 As a general rule, \"[a]s long as it is acting within the powers granted it under the Constitution, Congress may im ose its will on the States\" even \"in areas traditionally regulated by the States.\" Accordingly, as a default, the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution dictates that when congressional power and state sovereignty come in conflict, state sovereignty must give way.99 But for decades, the Supreme Court has recognized that there are limits to this general principle.","In Sugarman v. Dougall, the Court was called upon to decide whether a New York state statute, which prohibited the employment of noncitizens in a broad range of public positions, including primarily low-level nonpolicymaking positions, violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution.100 The Court held that the statute violated the guarantee of equal protection and rejected the State's claim that the employment prohibition was an exercise of the State's sovereign authority to define the identity of its own government. However, in considering the issue, the Court \"recognize[d] a State's interest in establishing its own form of government, and in limiting participation in that government to those who are within 'the basic conception of a political community\"' as well as \"the State's broad power to define its political cormmunity.\" t o 1 Most notably, the Court explained that if the statute had implicated \"functions that [went] to the heart of representative government,\" the Court's equal protection scrutiny would not have been \"so demanding where we deal[t] with matters resting firmly within a State's constitutional prerogatives.\"l02 This is a truly extraordinary statement. The Court here indicates that even where constitutional mandates come into conflict with fundamental aspects of state sovereignty, let alone statutory proscriptions, those constitutional rules must sometimes bend out of respect for the power constitutionally reserved to states. 103 It seems the default rule, set forth in the Supremacy Clause, is not absolute,","Just a few years later, in National League of Cities v. Usery, the Court established the high-water mark for the inviolability of state sovereignty.1 04 In National League of Cities, the Court held that Congress may not exercise its commerce power to interfere with state sovereignty \"in areas of traditional governmental functions.\" 105 This rule was short-lived, however, as nine years later, in Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, the Court abandoned this rule, holding that the \"traditional governmental functions\" test was unworkable.106 In Garcia, the Court acknowledged that there are undoubtedly limits on the power of Congress to exercise its commerce power so as to infringe on state sovereignty, but it expressed doubt \"that courts ultimately can identify principled constitutional limitations on the scope of Congress' Cornmerce Clause powers over the States merely by relying on a priori definitions of state sovereignty.\" 10 7 Instead, the Court suggested that the political process, not the courts, may be the appropriate constitutional mechanism to define the boundaries of inviolable state sovereignty.10","However, most recently, in Gregory v. Ashcroft, the Court has come full circle and once again embraced the balance originally suggested in Dougall. In Gregory, the Court was considering a challenge brought by Missouri state judges, claiming that the state constitution's mandatory retirement age violated, inter alia, the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA).1 0 9 If the provision violated the ADEA, the case presented the issue of whether Congress could constitutionally interfere with a state's ability to determine the qualifications for its own judges. The Court ultimately constructed a clear statement rule to avoid the difficult constitutional issue and held that the judges were not covered by the ADEA under the language of that statute.1 to However, in so holding, the Court strongly suggested that even where Congress is constitutionally empowered to act, it may not act in a way that infringes on \"state decisions that 'go to the heart of representative government\"' because such infringement \"would upset the usual constitutional balance of federal and state powers.\" 1 I","Accordingly, ((ul))in determining what rights states may universally deliver to their citizenship and what rights the federal government may prohibit a state from delivering, we are guided by the Court's decisions in Dougall and Gregory. It seems that those rights which go most directly to the \"heart of [a state's] representative government\" may not be infringed upon by Congress((/ul)), even through the exercise of its constitutionally enumerated powers. 1 12","As discussed in greater detail below, ((ul))the rights contemplated under an inclusive state citizenship scheme fall generally into three categories: political rights, rights of access to public programs and benefits, and rights to protection against mistreatment((/ul)).113 Political rights include the right to vote and hold public office. Rights of access to public programs and benefits include the rights to state-issued identification, driver's licenses, and equal access to state educational and health care programs. Finally, rights to protection against mistreatment include privacy protections, antidiscrimination protections, and assurances that the state and its subdivisions will not voluntarily participate in federal immigration enforcement activities targeting state citizens.","((ul))The legal inquiry for each of these rights is thus whether the right goes to the \"heart of representative government.\" Many rights may not, and thus Congress could in theory limit the ability of states to deliver these rights-though it has not.((/ul))114 However, ((ul))some of the rights attendant to an inclusive state citizenship scheme are essential to a functioning democracy, and thus any attempt to federally proscribe these rights should fail. Most notably, the political rightsto vote and hold office-have been repeatedly singled out by the Court as central to state sovereignty((/ul)). 115 In addition, ((ul))the right to state-issued identification is intimately connected to the power of states to define who is and who is not part of the political community, which is also central to state sovereignty and to \"the State's broad power to define its political community((/ul)).\" 1 1 6 Similarly, insofar as the education of the citizenry is a necessity for functioning democracy, ((ul))educational rights attendant to state citizenship could also potentially be conceived of as going to the \"heart of representative government((/ul)).\" 1 17","At base, ((ul))((hl))Congress is powerless to interfere with a state's desire to extend its citizenship to whomever it pleases((/hl))((/ul)). Similarly, ((ul))Congress cannot deprive state citizens of the core political or other rights necessary to establish a functioning democratic system of government. ((/ul))However, this inquiry regarding the ability of Congress to proscribe the rights attendant to citizenship is for now purely academic, as Congress has not acted to curtail any of the rights contained in the contemplated inclusive state citizenship scheme."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":124}},{"tag":"It’s Constitutional – state participation is allowed within fed guidelines","cite":"Fuller and Rust, 14 (Brandon Fuller is a research scholar at New York University and deputy director of the Urbanization Project at the NYU Stern School of Business.

China’s private companies are pushing deeply into the field as well, though the line between government and private in China sometimes blurs.

But it is definitely expanding in China.” Mr. Schwertfeger’s lab, which is part of ShanghaiTech University, works on ways for machines, without any aid from humans, to avoid obstacles.

Quantifying China’s spending push is difficult, because authorities there disclose little. But experts say it looks to be considerable. Numerous provinces and cities are spending billions on developing robotics, and a part of that funding is likely to go to artificial intelligence research. For example, the relatively unknown city of Xiangtan, in China’s Hunan province, has pledged $2 billion toward developing robots and artificial intelligence. Other places have direct incentives for the A.I. industry. In Suzhou, leading artificial intelligence companies can get about $800,000 in subsidies for setting up shop locally, while Shenzhen, in southern China, is offering $1 million to support any A.I. project established there. On a national level, China is working on a system to predict events like terrorist attacks or labor strikes based on possible precursors like labor strife. A paper funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China showed how facial recognition software can be simplified so that it can be more easily integrated with cameras across the country.

In a series of scenarios centered around the South China Sea, Taiwan and the East China Sea, Allison explored how well-established flashpoints involving China and the United States and its allies could spiral into unwanted war. Allison’s article argues that given the context of strategic rivalry between a rising power and a status-quo power, organizational and bureaucratic misjudgments increase the likelihood of unintended escalation. According to Allison, “the underlying stress created by China’s disruptive rise creates conditions in which accidental, otherwise inconsequential events could trigger a large-scale conflict.” This ((ul))argument appears persuasive((/ul)) on its surface, in no small part because it evokes insights from some of Allison’s groundbreaking work on the organizational pathologies that made the Cuban Missile Crisis so dangerous. However, ((ul))Allison ultimately fails to persuade ((/ul))because ((ul))he fails to specify the political and strategic conditions that make war plausible in the first place((/ul)). Allison’s analysis implies that the United States and China are in a situation analogous to that of the Soviet Union and the United States in the early 1960s. In the Cold War example, the two countries faced each other on a near-war footing and engaged in a bitter geostrategic and ideological struggle for supremacy. The two countries experienced a series of militarized crises and fought each other repeatedly through proxy wars. It was this broader context that made issues of misjudgment so dangerous in a crisis.

The ((ul))((hl))military competition((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) between China and the U((/ul))nited ((ul))S((/ul))tates ((ul))may be growing((/ul)), ((ul))but it ((/ul))((ul))((hl))operates at a far lower level of intensity((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) than((/ul)) the relentless ((ul))arms racing that typified the U.S.-Soviet standoff((/ul)). And unlike their Cold War counterparts, U.S. and Chinese militaries are not postured to fight each other in major wars. Moreover, polls show that the people of the two countries regard each other with mixed views —a considerable contrast from the hostile sentiment expressed by the U.S. and Soviet publics for each other. Lacking both preparations for major war and a constituency for conflict, leaders and bureaucracies in both countries have less incentive to misjudge crisis situations in favor of unwarranted escalation. To the contrary, ((ul))((hl))political leaders((/hl))((/ul)) and bureaucracies currently ((ul))((hl))face((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) a ((/ul))((ul))((hl))strong incentive to((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) find ways of ((/ul))((ul))((hl))defusing crises((/hl))((/ul)) in a manner ((ul))((hl))that avoids unwanted escalation((/hl))((/ul)). This ((ul))inclination ((/ul))((ul))((hl))manifested itself in((/hl))((/ul)) the EP-3 ((ul))((hl))airplane collision off Hainan((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) Island((/ul)) in 2001, and in subsequent incidents involving U.S. and Chinese ships and aircraft, such as the ((ul))((hl))harassment of((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))USNS Impeccable((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) in 2009((/ul)). This does not mean that there is no risk, however. Indeed, the potential for a dangerous militarized crisis may be growing. Moreover, key political and geostrategic developments could shift the incentives for leaders in favor of more escalatory options in a crisis and thereby make Allison’s scenarios more plausible. Past precedents offer some insight into the types of developments that would most likely propel the U.S.-China relationship into a hostile, competitive one featuring an elevated risk of conflict. The most important driver, as Allison recognizes, would be a growing parity between China and the United States as economic, technological and geostrategic leaders of the international system. The United States and China feature an increasing parity in the size of their economies, but the ((ul))((hl))U((/hl))((/ul))nited ((ul))((hl))S((/hl))((/ul))tates ((ul))((hl))retains a considerable lead((/hl))((/ul)) in virtually every other dimension of national power. The current U.S.-China rivalry is a regional one centered on the Asia-Pacific region, but it retains the considerable potential of escalating into a global, systemic competition down the road. A second important driver would be the mobilization of public opinion behind the view that the other country is a primary source of threat, thereby providing a stronger constituency for escalatory policies. A related development would be the formal designation by leaders in both capitals of the other country as a primary hostile threat and likely foe. These developments would most likely be fueled by a growing array of intractable disputes, and further accelerated by a serious militarized crisis. The cumulative effect would be the exacerbation of an antagonistic competitive rivalry, repeated and volatile militarized crisis, and heightened risk that any flashpoint could escalate rapidly to war—a relationship that would resemble the U.S.-Soviet relationship in the early 1960s. ((ul))Yet even if the relationship evolved towards a more hostile form of rivalry((/ul)), unique ((ul))features of the contemporary world suggest lessons drawn from the past((/ul)) ((ul))may have limited applicability((/ul)). ((ul))((hl))Economic interdependence((/hl))((/ul)) in the twenty-first century ((ul))((hl))is((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) much different and ((/ul))((ul))((hl))far more complex((/hl))((/ul)) than in it was in the past. So is the ((ul))lethality of weaponry available to the major powers((/ul)). In the sixteenth century, armies fought with pikes, swords and primitive guns. In the twenty-first century, it is possible to eliminate all life on the planet in a full-bore nuclear exchange. These features likely affect the willingness of leaders to escalate in a crisis in a manner far differently than in past rivalries. More broadly, Allison’s analysis about the “((ul))((hl))Thucydides Trap((/hl))((/ul))((ul))”((/ul)) may be criticized for ((ul))((hl))exaggerat((/hl))((/ul))((ul))ing the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))risks of war((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).((/hl)) In his claims to identify a high propensity for war between “rising” and “ruling” countries, he fails to clarify those terms, and does not distinguish the more dangerous from the less volatile types of rivalries. ((ul))Contests for supremacy over land regions((/ul)), for example, have historically proven the ((ul))most conflict-prone((/ul)), ((ul))while ((/ul))((ul))((hl))competition for((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))supremacy((/hl))((/ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((ul))((hl))over maritime regions has((/hl))((/ul)), by contrast, ((ul))((hl))tended to be less lethal((/hl))((/ul)). Rivalries also wax and wane over time, with varying levels of risks of war. A more careful review of rivalries and their variety, duration and patterns of interaction suggests that although most wars involve rivalries, many rivals avoid going to war . Misperceptions and strategic accidents remain a persistent feature of international politics, and it may well be that that mistakes are more likely to be lethal in periods of adjustment in relative power configurations. Rising states do have problems negotiating status quo changes with states that have staked out their predominance earlier. Even so, the ((ul))probability of war between China and the United States is almost certainly far less((/ul)) ((ul))than the 75 percent((/ul)) predicted by Allison.

Deterrence is a strategy designed to prevent one party from performing an unwanted action by reducing the benefits or heightening the potential costs of said action.11 In a paradigm where there is power parity, or the deterring party has superiority, a naval force will ideally develop a deterrence strategy which contains elements of both punishment and denial.12 This is the standard assumption on which naval analysts espouse the unique capacity of seapower to implement conventional deterrence.13 ((ul))((hl))The ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))forward-deployed and based ((/ul))((ul))((hl))U.S. Navy is the most powerful naval force in the world((/hl))((/ul))((hl)) ((/hl))and thus has the capacity to employ both elements.

Deterrence by punishment functions on the threat of retaliation if an opponent undertakes aggressive action.15 ((ul))It is the fear of these costs which deters unwanted action. The ((/ul))((ul))((hl))ability to operationalize deterrence by punishment is dependent on the possession of credible capabilities sufficient to hurt an aggressor((/hl))((/ul)).16 Under conditions of power asymmetry, punitive conventional naval capabilities that could sufficiently punish a larger power are beyond the capacity of smaller navies. The pursuit of such an approach is not only inefficient but is inherently risky under conditions of power asymmetry as it could provoke the larger power into pre-emptive action. Consequently((ul)), a weaker navy’s preferred deterrence option is deterrence by denial. Deterrence by denial concentrates on the prevention of an aggressor meeting its immediate goals((/ul)).17 This is enacted by “((ul))convincing an adversary that it cannot achieve its objectives rapidly or convincingly((/ul))” thereby preventing a fait accomplis and reducing the benefits of aggression.18 ((ul))((hl))Naval forces can be deployed to increase the uncertainties and heighten the potential costs to an aggressor((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) even if said military forces could not mount an effective defense((/ul)).19 In this case a deterrent capacity may be demonstrated in actual operations, ((ul))when deterrence initially fails but t((/ul))((ul))((hl))he defensive act, even if unsuccessful, imposes sufficient costs to deter repeat occurrences or further action((/hl))((/ul)).20 Despite their relative weakness, ((ul))smaller navies can impose a denial strategy as described above.

A major cyber attack could cut off electrical power, resulting in “people dying from heat or cold exposure, etc.,” said Granger Morgan, co-director of the Carnegie Mellon Electricity Industry Center and one of the chairs of the report. “A large outage of long duration could cover many states and last for weeks or longer.

As the U.S. adds more satellites, sensors, ground stations and other pieces of technology to its early warning network, the chances of a mishap rise — a troubling prospect that we’ve covered. But it’s a separate issue. But isn’t the potential for a cyber-physical attack becoming greater? Asked about it on Thursday, Greg Weaver, the Joint Staff deputy director of strategic capabilities, said, “Not sure I agree with that.” He added, “There’s no intent to expand the range of circumstances.” Said Soofer, the deputy assistant defense secretary: “We maintain in this document, as in other documents, that we retain some level of ambiguity that we would use nuclear weapons.

Just a few years ago, researchers were making headlines with rudimentary machines that housed less than a dozen qubits -- the quantum version of a classical computer's binary bit. At IBM's inaugural Index Developer Conference held in San Francisco this week, ((ul))the company showed off its latest prototype: a quantum computing rig housing 50 qubits, one of the most advanced machines currently in existence. ((/ul))Quantum computing -- with its ability to calculate and solve algorithms in parallel, at speeds far faster than conventional computers -- promises to revolutionize fields from chemistry and logistics to finance and physics. The thing is, while quantum computing is a technology for the world of tomorrow, ((ul))it ((/ul))((ul))((hl))hasn't yet advanced far enough for anyone to know what that world will actually look like((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) \"((ul))People aren't going to just wake up in three or four years, and say, 'Oh okay, now I'm ready to use quantum, what do I have to learn((/ul)),'\" Bob Sutor, VP of IBM Q Strategy and Ecosystem at IBM Research, told Engadget. ((ul))These systems rely on the \"spooky\" properties of quantum physics((/ul)), as Einstein put it, ((ul))and their ((/ul))((ul))((hl))operation is radically different from how today's computers work((/hl))((/ul)). \"What you're basically doing is you're replacing the notion of bits with something called qubits,\" Sutor said. \"Ultimately when you measure a qubit it's zero or one, but before that there's a realm of freedom of what that can actually be. It's not zero and one at the same time or anything like this, it just takes on values from a much, much larger mathematical space. \"The basic logic gates [AND, OR, NOT, NOR, etc], those gates are different for quantum,\" he continued. \"The way the different qubits work together to get to a solution is completely different from the way the bits within your general memory works.\" Rather than tackling problems in sequence, as classical computers do, quantum rigs attempt to solve them in parallel. This enables quantum computers to solve certain equations, such as modeling complex molecules, far more efficiently. This efficiency, however, is tempered by the system's frailty. Currently, a qubit's coherence time tops out at 90 microseconds before decaying. ((ul))That is, if a qubit is designated as a 1, it'll only remain a 1 for 0.0009 seconds. \"After that all bets are off. You've got a certain amount of time in which to actually use this thing reliably,\"((/ul)) Sutor said. \"Any computations you're going to do with a qubit have to come within that period.\" ((ul))As such ((/ul))((ul))((hl))quantum computers are highly sensitive to interference from temperature, microwaves, photons, even the electricity running the machine itself.((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) Sutor said, \"With heat you've got lots of electrons moving around, bumping into each other,\" which can lead to the qubit's decoherence. That's why these rigs have to be cooled to near absolute zero on order to operate. ((/ul))\"Outer space in the shade is between two and three degree Kelvin,\" Sutor explained. \"((ul))Outer space is much too warm to do these types of calculations((/ul)).\" Instead, ((ul))the lowest levels of a quantum computer rig, where the calculations themselves take place((/ul)), exist at a frosty 10 millikelvin ((ul))-- a hundreth of a degree above absolute zero((/ul)). So no, Sutor assured Engadget, we probably shouldn't expect desktop quantum computers running at room temperature to exist within the next few decades -- perhaps even within our lifetimes. Surprisingly, these systems are fairly energy efficient. Aside from the energy needed to sufficiently cool the system for operation (a process that takes around 36 hours) IBM's 50-qubit rig only draws 10 to 15 kilowatts of power -- roughly equivalent to 10 standard microwave ovens. So now that IBM has developed a number of quantum computer systems ranging from 5 to 50 qubits, the next challenge is figuring out what to do with them. And that's where the company's Q network comes in. Last December, IBM announced that it's partnering with a number of Fortune 500 companies and research institutes -- including JPMorgan Chase, Samsung, Honda, Japan's Keio University, Oak Ridge National Lab and Oxford University -- to suss out potential practical applications for the technology. Learning centers like Keio University also act as localized hubs. \"We in IBM research, while we have a large team on this, we can't work with everybody in the world who wants to work on quantum computing,\" Sutor explained. These hubs, however, \"can work with local companies, local colleges, whomever to do whatever. They would get their quantum computer power from us, but they would be at the front lines.\" The same is true for Oakridge National Lab, Oxford University and the University of Melbourne. What's more, the company has also launched the IBM Q experience which allows anyone -- businesses, universities, even private citizens -- to write and submit their own quantum application or experiment to be run on the company's publicly available quantum computing rig. It's essentially a cloud service for quantum computations. So far more than 75,000 people have taken advantage of the service, running more than 2.5 million calculations which have resulted in more than two dozen published research papers on subjects ranging from quantum phase space measurement to homomorphic encryption. But while the public's interest in this technology is piqued, there is a significant knowledge gap that must be overcome before we start to see quantum applications proliferate the way classical programs did in the 1970s and '80s. \"Let's say in the future you're running investment house types of calculations [similar to the financial risk applications that JP Morgan is currently developing],\" Sutor points out, \"there are big questions as to what those would be, and what the algorithms would be. We're way too early to have anything determined like that, even to the extent of knowing how well [quantum computing] will be applicable in some of these other areas.\" The entry point for writing programs is a challenge too. For classical computers, it's as simple as running a compiler. But there's not yet such a function for quantum computers. \"What does it mean to optimize a quantum program knowing that this completely different from the model that's in your phone?\" he queried. ((ul))Another challenge that must be overcome is how to scale these machines. As Sutor points out, it's a simple enough task to add qubits to silicon chips, but every component added, increases the amount of heat generated and the amount of energy needed to keep the system within its operational temperature boundaries. So rather than simply packing in more and more qubits and setting off a quantum version of Moore's Law, Sutor believes that the next major step forward for this technology is quality over quantity.((/ul)) \"Having 50 great qubits is much more powerful than having 2,000 lousy ones,\" he quipped. \"You don't want something very noisy that you're going to have to fix,\" but instead research should focus on improving the system's fidelity over increasing the qubit count. But even as quantum technologies continue to improve, there will still be a place in the world of tomorrow for classical computers. \"Don't think of quantum as a wholesale replacement for anything you do,\" Sutor warned. \"The theory says that ((ul))((hl))you could run any classical algorithm on a quantum rig but it would be so glacially slow because it's not designed to run those types of products((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).\" ((/ul))Instead, Sutor prefers to think of the current crop of quantum technologies as an accelerator. \"It does certain things very quickly, it does some things we don't know how to do well classically... and so it'll work hand in hand that way.\" And if you're waiting for today's quantum computers to be able to compete with modern supercomputers anytime soon, you shouldn't hold your breath.

They were quite successful at killing people: The 6th century’s Plague of Justinian knocked out an estimated 17 percent of the world’s population; the 14th century Black Death decimated a third of Europe; the 1918 influenza pandemic killed 5 percent of the world; malaria is estimated to have killed half of all humans who have ever lived. Any yet, of course, humanity continued to flourish. ((ul))((hl))Our species’ recent explosion in lifespan is almost exclusively the result of the control of infectious diseases through sanitation, vaccination, and antimicrobial therapies((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).((/hl)) Only in the modern era, in which many infectious diseases have been tamed in the industrial world, do people have the luxury of death from cancer, heart disease, or stroke in the 8th decade of life. Childhoods are free from watching siblings and friends die from outbreaks of typhoid, scarlet fever, smallpox, measles, and the like. So what would it take for a disease to wipe out humanity now? In Michael Crichton’s The Andromeda Strain, the canonical book in the disease-outbreak genre, an alien microbe threatens the human race with extinction, and humanity’s best minds are marshaled to combat the enemy organism. Fortunately, outside of fiction, there’s no reason to expect alien pathogens to wage war on the human race any time soon, and my analysis suggests that any real-life domestic microbe reaching an extinction level of threat probably is just as unlikely. ((ul))((hl))Any apocalyptic pathogen would need to possess a very special combination of two attributes. First, it would have to be so unfamiliar that no existing therapy or vaccine could be applied to it. Second, it would need to have a high and surreptitious transmissibility before symptoms occur((/hl))((/ul)). The first is essential because ((ul))any microbe from a known class of pathogens would, by definition, have family members that could serve as models for containment and countermeasures((/ul)). The second would allow the hypothetical disease to spread without being detected by even the most astute clinicians. ((ul))((hl))The three infectious diseases most likely to be considered extinction-level threats in the world today—influenza, HIV, and Ebola—don’t meet these two((/hl))((/ul)) requirements. ((ul))Influenza((/ul)), for instance, ((ul))despite its well-established ability to kill on a large scale, its contagiousness, and its unrivaled ability to shift and drift away from our vaccines, is still what I would call a “known unknown.” ((/ul))While there are many mysteries about how new flu strains emerge, from at least the time of Hippocrates, humans have been attuned to its risk. And in the modern era, ((ul))a full-fledged industry of influenza preparedness exists, with effective vaccine strategies and antiviral therapies. ((/ul))HIV, which has killed 39 million people over several decades, is similarly limited due to several factors. Most importantly, ((ul))HIV’s dependency on blood((/ul)) and body fluid for transmission (similar to Ebola) requires intimate human-to-human contact, which ((ul))limits contagion((/ul)). Highly potent antiviral therapy allows most people to live normally with the disease, and a substantial group of the population has genetic mutations that render them impervious to infection in the first place. Lastly, simple prevention strategies such as needle exchange for injection drug users and barrier contraceptives—when available—can curtail transmission risk. ((ul))Ebola((/ul)), for many of the same reasons as HIV as well as several others, also falls short of the mark. This is especially due to the fact that it ((ul))spreads almost exclusively through people with easily recognizable symptoms, plus the taming of its once unfathomable 90 percent mortality rate by simple supportive care. Beyond those three,((/ul))((ul))((hl)) every other known disease falls short of what seems required to wipe out humans((/hl))((/ul))((ul))—which is, of course, why we’re still here((/ul)). And it’s not that diseases are ineffective. On the contrary, ((ul))((hl))diseases’ failure to knock us out is a testament to just how resilient humans are((/hl))((/ul))((hl)). P((/hl))((ul))((hl))art of our evolutionary heritage is our immune system, one of the most complex on the planet, even without the benefit of vaccines or the helping hand of antimicrobial drugs.((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))This system, when viewed at a species level, can adapt to almost any enemy imaginable. Coupled to genetic variations amongst humans—which open up the possibility for a range of advantages, from imperviousness to infection to a tendency for mild symptoms—((ul))this((/ul))((ul))((hl)) adaptability ensures that almost any infectious disease onslaught will leave a large proportion of the population alive to rebuild((/hl))((/ul))((hl)),((/hl)) in contrast to the fictional Hollywood versions. While the immune system’s role can never be understated, an even more powerful protector is the faculty of consciousness. Humans are not the most prolific, quickly evolving, or strongest organisms on the planet, but as Aristotle identified, humans are the rational animals—and it is this fundamental distinguishing characteristic that allows humans to form abstractions, think in principles, and plan long-range. These capacities, in turn, allow humans to modify, alter, and improve themselves and their environments. Consciousness equips us, at an individual and a species level, to make nature safe for the species through such technological marvels as antibiotics, antivirals, vaccines, and sanitation. When humans began to focus their minds on the problems posed by infectious disease, human life ceased being nasty, brutish, and short. In many ways, human consciousness became infectious diseases’ worthiest adversary. None of this is meant to allay all fears of infectious diseases. To totally adopt a Panglossian viewpoint would be foolish—and dangerous. Humans do face countless threats from infectious diseases: witness Zika. And if not handled appropriately, severe calamity could, and will, ensue. The West African Ebola outbreak, for instance, festered for months before major efforts to bring it under control were initiated. When it comes to infectious diseases, I’m worried about the failure of institutions to understand the full impact of outbreaks. I’m worried about countries that don’t have the infrastructure or resources to combat these outbreaks when they come. But ((ul))as long as we can keep adapting, I’m not worried about the future of the human race.((/ul))"],"stats":{"highlightedWords":170}},{"tag":"AI wont get used in healthcare—needs access to protected data.","cite":"Patricia Balthazar et al. 18 {The Journal of the American College of Radiology (sometimes abbreviated JACR) is a monthly peer-reviewed medical journal covering radiology.

What’s most disturbing about this litany of pain is that ((ul))it’s only going to get worse.((/ul)) A recent paper in the journal Nature estimates that ((ul))o((/ul))((ul))((hl))ur chances of keeping global warming below the danger threshold of 2 degrees is now vanishingly small: only about 5 per cent.((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) It’s more likely that we’re headed for around 3.2 degrees of warming, and possibly as much as 4.9 degrees.

Indeed, there’s a good chance that it would render large-scale civilization impossible. ((/ul))Why are our prospects so bleak? According to the paper’s authors, it’s because ((ul))the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))cuts we’re making to greenhouse gas emissions are being more than cancelled out by economic growth.((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) In the coming decades, we’ll be able to reduce the carbon intensity (CO2 per unit of GDP) of the global economy by about 1.9 per cent per year, ((/ul))they say, if we make heavy investments in clean energy and efficient technology. That’s a lot. But ((ul))((hl))as long as the economy keeps growing((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) by more than that,((/ul))((ul))((hl)) total emissions are still going to rise((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). Right now we’re ratcheting up global GDP by 3 per cent per year. A((/ul))t that rate, ((ul))the maths is not in our favour((/ul)); on the contrary, it’s slapping us in the face. In fact, ((ul))according to new models published last year, with a background rate of 3 per cent GDP growth it’s not possible to achieve any level of emissions reductions at all, even under best-case-scenario conditions((/ul)). Study after study shows the same thing: ((ul))keeping global warming below 2 degrees is simply not compatible with continued economic growth. ((/ul))This is a tough pill to swallow. After all, right now GDP growth is the primary policy objective of virtually every government on Earth. Over ((ul))in Silicon Valley, tech-optimists are hoping that a miracle of artificial intelligence might allow us to decarbonise the economy by 3 per cent or more per year((/ul)), so we can continue growing the GDP while reducing emissions. It sounds wonderful. But ((ul))remember, t((/ul))((ul))((hl))he goal is not just to reduce carbon emissions – the goal is to reduce them dramatically((/hl))((/ul)), and fast. How fast, exactly? Climate scientists Kevin Anderson and Alice Bows say that if we want ((ul))t((/ul))((ul))((hl))o have even a mere 50 per cent chance of staying under 2 degrees, rich nations are going to have to cut emissions by 8-10 per cent per year((/hl))((/ul)), beginning in 2015. Keep in mind we’re already two years in, and so far our emissions reductions have been zero. Here’s the hard bit. ((ul))((hl))It’s just not possible to achieve emissions reductions of 8-10 per cent per year by decarbonising the econom((/hl))((/ul))((ul))y. In fact, there is a strong scientific consensus that((/ul))((ul))((hl)) emissions reductions of this rate are only feasible if we((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) stop our mad pursuit of economic growth and do something totally unprecedented: ((/ul))((ul))((hl))begin to scale down our annual production and consumption((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). ((/ul))This is what ecologists call ‘planned de-growth’. It sounds horrible, at first glance. It sounds like austerity, or voluntary poverty. After all, for decades we’ve been told that GDP growth is good, that it’s essential to progress, and that if we want to eradicate poverty around the world, we need more of it. The only reason we’re all chasing GDP growth is because we’ve been made to believe that it’s the only way to improve the incomes and lives of ordinary people. But it’s not. Politicians and economists rally around GDP growth because they see it as preferable to redistribution. They would rather grow the pie than go about the messy business of sharing what we already have more equally, since the latter tends to upset rich people. Henry Wallich, a former member of the US Federal Reserve Board, made this clear when he pointed out that ‘Growth is a substitute for equality’. But we can flip Wallich’s greedy little quip on its head: if growth is a substitute for equality, then equality can be a substitute for growth. By sharing what we already have more fairly, we can render additional economic growth unnecessary. In this sense, de-growth is nothing at all like austerity. In fact, it’s exactly the opposite. Austerity means cutting social spending and slashing taxes on the rich in order to – supposedly – keep the economy growing. This has crushing consequences for ordinary people’s lives. ((ul))((hl))De-growth((/hl))((/ul))((hl)),((/hl)) by contrast, ((ul))((hl))calls for cutting the excesses of the richest while redistributing existing resources and investing in social goods – universal healthcare, education, affordable housing etc((/hl))((/ul))((hl)). ((/hl))The whole point is to sustain and even improve human wellbeing without the need for endless economic expansion((ul)). De-growth is a philosophy that insists that our economy is already more than abundant enough for all of us – if only we learn how to share it. One easy way to do this would be to roll out a universal basic income and fund it through new progressive taxes((/ul)) – taxes on carbon, on land, on resource use, on financial transactions, and so on. This is the most sensible and elegant way to share our abundance, and it comes with an added benefit: if the basic income is high enough, it will free people to walk away from unnecessary jobs that produce unnecessary stuff, releasing some of the pressure on our planet. Crucially((ul)), de-growth does not mean we have to get rid of the stock of stuff that we already have((/ul)), as a nation: houses, furniture, shoes, museums, railways, whatever. In fact, ((ul))it doesn’t even mean that we have to stop producing and consuming new stuff. It just means we have to reduce the amount of new stuff that we produce and consume each year.((/ul)) When you see it this way, it’s really not so threatening. ((ul))If we degrow by 5 per cent per year (which is what scientists say is necessary), that means we have to cut our consumption of new stuff by 5 per cent.((/ul)) It’s easy to make up for that by just repairing and reusing stuff we already have. And we can encourage this more creative approach to stuff by curbing advertising, like Sao Paulo, Chennai and other cities have done. Of course, there are deeper, more structural dimensions of our economy that we will have to change. ((ul))One of the reasons we need growth is to pay off all the debt that’s sloshing around in our economy((/ul)). In fact, our entire money system is based on debt: more than 90 per cent of the currency circulating in our economy is loans created out of thin air by commercial banks. ((ul))The problem with debt is that it comes with interest, and to pay off interest at a compound rate we have to work, earn, and sell more and more each year.

Perhaps there’s still time to take the concrete, immediate actions experts suggest — along the minimum efforts laid out in the 2015 Paris accord that amplified suggestions made by President Barack Obama in his June 25, 2013 speech at Georgetown University — that would ensure a sustainable, high-quality future. Tipping points are the cusp between one set of conditions and another; ((ul))((hl))when a tipping point is passed, change is rapid, uncontrolled and often irreversible((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). Passing a tipping point is like crossing a threshold from one room to another and having the door triple-locked behind you; ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the state of the world after the tipping point is very different from the state of the world before the tipping point, and it is very difficult to go back.((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))It’s important to make this distinction, because Malcolm Gladwell erroneously redefined tipping points more than a decade ago in his book, The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference. In doing so, he changed the way we think about rapidly emerging social phenomena, such as the Dutch tulip frenzy, the housing bubble, or the re-emergence of a market for Hush Puppies. Although many have argued that the publication of The Tipping Point itself was a tipping point in how we think and talk about tipping points, Gladwell weakly equated tipping points with viral epidemics. This misleading analogy obscured the true meaning of “tipping point,” leading to confusion in how we think about responding to rapid environmental change. Epidemics, you see, require an initial infection in a particular individual, a pool of nearby people susceptible to the same infection, and a way for the disease to be transmitted to the susceptible individuals. Gladwell similarly invoked mavens, connectors and salesmen who collect and transmit new ideas to the wider world to explain the rapid emergence of new social phenomena. But this analogy doesn’t necessarily work; resistance evolves to new diseases, epidemics peak and burn out, and most new social phenomena are simply fads. In fact all of the examples in The Tipping Point — the sudden emergence of fax machines and Airwalk sneakers, the resurgence of sales of Hush Puppies suede shoes, the rise and fall of crime rate in many cities (that is rising once again in some), and sudden epidemics of suicides — are of explosions of interest in new phenomena followed by a return to the status quo ante and a search for the next new fad. But they are not tipping points. In contrast, economists, sociologists, historians, ecologists, climatologists, oceanographers and most others who for decades have given serious study to tipping points focus on rapid, seemingly permanent changes. In modern parlance, a ((ul))tipping point presages a change in regime. And((/ul))((ul))((hl)) the prime example of a tipping point in the natural world is, many feel, climate change((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).((/hl)) Bill McKibben and the thousands of followers of 350.org working to solve the climate crisis assert that we passed a tipping point in the 1980s, when human industry caused the concentration of atmospheric CO2 to exceed 350 ppm: the so-called “safe” level of CO2 in the atmosphere. President Obama noted at Georgetown that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been measuring CO2 since the 1950s because of that agency’s even earlier concern that the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would disrupt the fragile balance of nature that makes our planet so hospitable to life and push us over the tipping point that leads to a planet beyond repair. So on 5/9 — when NOAA’s observatory atop Mauna Loa, Hawaii, recorded a concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that exceeded 400 parts per million (0.04 percent) for the first time in recorded history — a tipping point finally may have been passed. Although ((ul))the deciduous forests of the northern hemisphere that provide New England with spectacular colors every fall will inhale some of that CO2 as they leaf out every spring, those great “lungs of the planet” cannot keep the CO2 in the atmosphere below 400 ppm.((/ul)) And((hl)) ((/hl))((ul))((hl))even if an all-powerful deity were to manage to convince us to stop burning of all fossil fuels today, the “inertia” in the climate system would ensure that the Earth’s temperature would keep increasing and sea levels would continue to rise ((/hl))((/ul))another meter or two over the next 2,000 years.((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))The inexorable warming of the planet caused by an ever-denser blanket of CO2 above us is not a fad ((/hl))((/ul))— on 5/9, ((ul))((hl))we passed a tipping point and entered a new world.((/hl))((/ul)) This new reality is a consequence of our lifestyles intersecting with fundamental and unbreakable laws of physics.

The assault on honest debate More than an academic rejoinder, Hall et al.'s response gives the impression of a resolute protest petition (symbolically signed by 51 scholars) aimed at both Tourism Managementand the present dissenting authors for having the audacity to produce such a “deviant” paper, which sheds light on inconvenient (as far as the mainstream environmental movement goes) scientific evidence. The rhetoric style used by Hall el al. to undermine the arguments presented in our paper is well known to those who are familiar with the intense scientific debate on climate change. ((ul))Climate change alarmists have never hesitated to ridicule and bully environmental skeptics, using ad hominem arguments, for example when labeling them as “deniers((/ul))” (a designation invoking “holocaust deniers”) ((ul))or “right-wing extremists,” dealing with “voodoo science.” These styles and language are indicative of an academic witch-hunt, rather than factual and productive scientific discourse. ((/ul))This disturbing approach has also been reflected in active attempts on behalf of powerful gatekeepers to censor and silence nonconforming voices. The email controversy at the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia (best known as “Climategate”) revealed in 2009, demonstrated what can be easily be termed as “climate McCarthyism.” This scandal exposed plots by leading and influential researchers to academically cast off dissenting climatologists, suppress the publication of articles that failed to fall in line with the narrative of man-made global warming, and even removing “uncooperative” journal editors from their positions. In light of this upsetting background, we feel a strong sense of appreciation for the editor and reviewers of Tourism Management for recognizing the value of open debate on the subject and allowing it to take place in this important outlet. 2. The “consensus” on anthropogenic climate change Hall et al. accuse us of “climate change denial and misrepresentation” in arguing that “climate change is a highly controversial scientific topic” and that “the theory of anthropogenic global warming (AGW)…is far from being conclusive” (Shani & Arad, 2014, p. 82). In their attempt to refute these claims, Hall et al. first extensively refer to the reports of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which decisively and consistently warn against dangerous and unprecedented man-made climate change. Yet, the reputation of the IPCC, “the Vatican of climate science,” has sustained serious harm in recent years due to accusations of tribalism, lack of scrutiny, and controversies such as Climagegate (the IPCC relied heavily on the scientific work of CRU) (Hulme & Ravetz, 2009). Climategate revealed the manipulation of scientific literature to be included in IPCC reports as well as intentional disregard of other peer-reviewed articles that were disagreeable with the IPCC's desired conclusions (Holliman, 2011, Ryghaug and Skjölsvold, 2010). Consequently, the InterAcademy Council (IAC), ((ul))((hl))a global network consisting of over 106 national science academies, issued a critique of the IPCC's procedures and processes, indicating critical deficiencies in its work and pointing to the need for fundamental transformations to restore the perceived impartiality of the IPCC and to prevent incidents of groupthink in the future((/hl))((/ul))((hl)) ((/hl))(Shapiro et al., 2010). There is not enough time or space to cover all the inaccuracies, misinformation and factual errors detected in IPCC reports. However, these include the Himalayan glaciers fiasco (in which the IPCC's claim that the glaciers in the Himalayas would melt away by 2035 was based on a misprint – for 2350 – in a story that appeared in an environmental pressure group's report) (Cogley, Kargel, Kaser, & van der Veen, 2010), and the deliberate concealment of scientific data invalidating the “hockey stick” graph, which (falsely) presented the 1990s as the hottest decade in the millennium (Holland, 2007, McKitrick, 2005). Given IPCC's problematic record, it is simply irresponsible to take their reports unquestionably, as Hall et al. do. Interestingly, they heavily criticized us for (negligibly, we might add) referring to “non-peer-reviewed” materials, such as reports from conservative think tanks (by the way, Cato Institute is far from being “conservative”). Perhaps Hall et al. should more seriously consider the idiom “people who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.” Following the summary of the IPCC's main conclusions, Hall et al. moves to establish their claim on “((ul))scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change,” by detailing the resonant study of Cook et al. (2013).((/ul)) According to this study's findings, about 97% of abstracts of scientific papers on climate issues from 1991 to 2011 support the alleged consensus on AGW. The 97% figure indeed sounds impressive and received much attention in the media and from politicians and policymakers (including US President Barak Obama). Yet unfortunately, ((ul))a careful review of the study and its methodology reveals that very little can actually be concluded. The “consensus” referred to in Cook et al.'s study (2013) applies to trivial consensus according to which carbon dioxide (CO2) is a greenhouse gas and that humanity is capable of warming the planet, premises that are accepted even among most climate change skeptics.((/ul)) Yet, issues such as the extent and rate of climate change, the extent of the human factor in causing climate change, the consequences of climate change, and the optimal strategies to respond to climate change are at the heart of the scientific debate. Cook et al.'s paper (2013), as well as other related studies such as Anderegg, Prall, Harold, and Schneider (2010), provide no valuable insights on the extent of agreement regarding AGW, but were nevertheless successfully utilized for public relations purposes. 3. Uncertainty in climate change assessments ((ul))Hall et al. defend the I((/ul))((ul))((hl))PCC's climate models and attack our assertion that they have thus far failed to demonstrate a high level of accuracy, citing the IPCC's accounts themselves as evidence. ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))I((/ul))n doing so, they largely ignore the clear evidence that since 1997((hl)) ((/hl))((ul))((hl))there has been no discernible rise in aggregate global temperatures, despite continuing greenhouse gas emissions ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))(Curry, 2014). ((/ul))Furthermore, despite the “very high confidence” the IPCC attributes to its models in reproducing observed temperatures, consistent large disparities have been detected between observed and simulated global warming (Christy et al., 2010, Douglass and Christy, 2013). Several explanations have been suggested for the – unforeseen by climate models – warming hiatus and the overestimated rise in temperatures (e.g., Fyfe et al., 2013, Solomon et al., 2010), but this clearly raises serious questions as to the confidence policymakers should place in the IPCC's projections of climate change (Curry, 2011). Despite the claims made by the IPCC (and also mentioned by Hall et al.), their profound understanding of the climate change mechanism does not seem to improve over time. ((ul))Consider the crucial issue of climate sensitivity, i.e. the amount of warming that doubling CO2 in the atmosphere would eventually produce. ((/ul))According to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (2007), the equilibrium climate sensitivity is likely in the range 2 °C–4.5 °C, while according to its newer Fifth Assessment Report (2013) it is 1.5 °C–4.5 °C. In other words, ((ul))the likely equilibrium sensitivity is now known less accurately.((/ul)) Astrophysicist and climate researcher Nir Shaviv responded to this lack of improved understanding, “After perhaps billions of dollars invested in climate research over more than three decades, our ability to answer the most important question in climate has not improved a single bit!” (2013, para 6). Shaviv accused the IPCC of dogmatic science that prevents its members from recognizing the errors in the basic premises of AGW. Other studies reported that climate sensitivity could be significantly lower than is suggested by IPCC (Otto et al., 2013, Shaviv, 2005, Schlesinger et al., 2012). ((ul))The i((/ul))((ul))((hl))mplications of lower climate sensitivity than the IPCC's estimations are that the future global warming will be slower, allowing humanity more time for gradual adaptation to climate changes.((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))The uncertainty that encompasses current climate change assessments is strengthened in light of the studies indicating that over earth's history there have been distinct warm periods with temperatures exceeding the current ones (Esper et al., 2012, McIntyre and McKittrick, 2003, Soon and Baliunas, 2003). Reviewing the relevant scientific literature, Khandekar, Murty, and Chittibabu (2005) concluded that “in the context of the earth's climate through the last 500 million years, the recent (1975–2000) increase in the earth's mean temperature does not appear to be unusual or unprecedented as claimed by IPCC and many supporters of the global warming hypothesis” (p. 1568). Other studies challenged the mainstream climate change narrative, according to which CO2 levels in the earth's atmosphere play a prominent role in rising temperatures. One notable example is the research by Shaviv and Veizer (2003), which demonstrates that the earth's temperature correlates well with variations in cosmic ray flux, rather than changes in atmospheric CO2. These findings and others stir contentious debates within the climate scientific community, but are nevertheless largely overlooked by the IPCC, which ignores alternative explanations for climate change. Regrettably, Hall et al. scornfully dismiss this evidence, presented in our research note, based on cherry-picking of a few “non-peer-reviewed” references that were cited, some vague claims about “misreading” and “selective citing,” as well as other semantic nitpicking. 4. Impacts of climate change The IPCC warns that climate change is likely to have severe consequences, particularly for poor countries, such as increased hunger, water shortages, vulnerability to extreme weather events and debilitating diseases. However, these estimations have been heavily criticized for failing to properly account for substantial improvements in adaptive capacity (i.e., the capability of coping with the impact of global warming) that are likely to occur due to advances in economic development, technological change and human capital over the next century (Goklany, 2007). ((ul))Fostering economic growth and technological development, largely achievable through the use of fossil fuels, will strengthen both industrialized and developing countries' adaptive capacity to deal not just with possible future climate change consequences, but also with other environmental and public health problems((/ul)). Such policy will provide greater benefits at lower costs than drastic climate change mitigation efforts involving substantially cutting greenhouse gas emissions (Goklany, 2004, Goklany, 2012). Furthermore, the analyses of Galiana and Green (2009) exemplify that in the current state of energy technologies, the suggested plans for ambitious emission reductions will likely severely clobber the global economy, especially in view of present economic conditions. In order to stabilize atmospheric CO2 at accepted levels, there is a need for enormous advances in efficient energy technology, which is currently missing (Pielke, Wigley & Green, 2008). In any case, even if every industrialized nation meets the most ambitious emissions targets set by the Kyoto Protocol, such efforts are likely to have little effect, particularly in the light of the considerable increases in greenhouse gas emissions by rising economic superpowers as China and India, as well as the remaining developing world (Wigley, 1998). Hall et al. criticized us for choosing “selective citations…that discuss natural processes potentially affect climate in specific locations and times.” Yet ((ul))the purpose of referring to such studies was to refute the claims made by the IPCC and other climate change alarmists to the effect that recent extreme weather events ((/ul))(e.g., floods, droughts and storms) ((ul))are((/ul)) ((ul))the consequences of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases((/ul)). Moreover, ((ul))data shows that ((/ul))despite claims that the number and intensity of extreme weather has increased, between 1900 and 2010 ((ul))the average annual death and death rates from((/ul)) ((ul))extreme weather events has declined by 93% and 98%, respectively((/ul)) (Goklany, 2009). This is mostly due to economic and technological factors, such as improved global food production, increase globalized food trade and better disaster preparedness. IPCC's exaggerated estimations of climate change impacts were also noted in an op-ed in Financial Times written by climate economist Richard Tol (2014), a week following his demand that his name as one of the leading authors be removed from the IPCC's AR5 due to its over alarmist assessments of the impacts of AGW and underestimation of humanity's adaptive capacity. As concluded by Tol, “((ul))((hl))Humans are a tough and adaptable species.((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) People live on the equator and in the Arctic, in the desert and in the rainforest. We survived ice ages with primitive technologies. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))The idea that climate change poses an existential threat to humankind is laughable((/hl))((/ul))((ul))”((/ul)) (2014, para 1)."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":140}},{"tag":"Alt Causes- censorship, torturing, restriction of freedoms, opacity.","cite":"Kenneth Roth 18 {Kenneth Roth is the executive director of Human Rights Watch, one of the world's leading international human rights organizations, which operates in more than 90 countries. 2018. “World Report 2018” https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2018/country-chapters/china-and-tibet}//JM","text":["The broad and sustained offensive on human rights that started after President Xi Jinping took power five years ago showed no sign of abating in 2017.

Police ensured the detainees’ compliance by torturing some of them, denying them access to lawyers of their choice, and holding them incommunicado for months. In Xinjiang, a nominally autonomous region with 11 million Turkic Muslim Uyghurs, authorities stepped up mass surveillance and the security presence despite the lack of evidence demonstrating an organized threat. They also adopted new policies denying Uyghurs cultural and religious rights. Hong Kong’s human rights record took a dark turn. ((ul))Hong Kong courts disqualified four pro-democracy lawmakers in July and jailed three prominent pro-democracy student leaders in August.

In April, security officials at the United Nations headquarters in New York City ejected from the premises Dolkun Isa, an ethnic Uyghur rights activist, who was accredited as a nongovernmental organization (NGO) participant to a forum there; no explanation was provided. In June, the European Union failed for the first time ever to deliver a statement under a standing agenda item at the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) regarding country situations requiring the council’s attention. This stemmed from Greece blocking the necessary EU consensus for such an intervention due to its unwillingness to criticize human rights violations in China, with which it has substantial trade ties. Chinese officials continued throughout the year to pressure governments around the world to forcibly return allegedly corrupt mainland officials despite a lack of legal protections in China or refugee status determination procedures outside China. Despite the high costs, many in China continued to fight for rights and justice in 2017. Activists, including those working on women’s, disability, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights, continued to take cases to court to seek limited redress and raise awareness. In a small but significant step, in July a court in Henan province ruled against a public hospital for forcing a gay man to undergo discriminatory “conversion therapy.” In its narrow ruling, the court found that admitting the plaintiff to the hospital against his will violated his rights. Human Rights Defenders The death of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo in 2017 laid bare authorities’ ruthlessness towards peaceful proponents of human rights and democracy. In July, after serving nearly nine years of his 11-year prison sentence for “inciting subversion,” Liu Xiaobo died from cancer in a Shenyang hospital, heavily guarded by state security. During his hospitalization, authorities isolated Liu and his wife, Liu Xia, from family and supporters, and denied Liu’s request to seek treatment outside the country. Since Liu’s death, authorities have forcibly disappeared Liu Xia. The government also harassed and detained a group of Liu’s supporters for commemorating his death. In 2017, authorities continued politically motivated prosecutions of human rights activists and lawyers who were rounded up in a nationwide crackdown that began in July 2015. Lawyer Wang Quanzhang and activist Wu Gan remained in police custody, awaiting trial or verdict on baseless charges. In November, lawyer Jiang Tianyong was sentenced to two years in prison on charges of “inciting subversion of state power.” ((ul))A number of those caught in the “709 crackdown” were freed, but they continue to be closely monitored and isolated from friends and colleagues; some revealed that they were tortured and forced to confess while in detention. Authorities also continued to harass and intimidate the lawyers who represent the detainees((/ul)), ordering them not to speak to media and disbarring several after giving them failing marks in China’s annual lawyers’ evaluation. In March, a court in Guangdong province, in separate trials, convicted women’s rights activist Su Changlan and online political commentator Chen Qitang on baseless charges of “inciting subversion” and sentenced them to prison terms of three years and four-and-a-half years, respectively. Su was released in October after serving her sentence. Her health deteriorated sharply while in detention due to inadequate medical care and poor conditions in detention. In March, a Sichuan court sentenced artist Chen Yunfei to four years in prison on charges of “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” in connection with his activities commemorating the 1989 Tiananmen Massacre.

((ul))Freedom of Expression Authorities adopted new measures to limit access to circumvention tools that allow netizens to scale the Great Firewall to access the uncensored global internet.((/ul)) In January 2017, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued regulations making it unlawful to provide circumvention tools without the ministry’s pre-approval. In March, Chongqing authorities made public a regulation that bans unauthorized use of internet circumvention tools in the city. Anyone—from individuals to companies—who does so would be ordered to disconnect and receive a warning. The regulation was unprecedented in banning all use of these tools. The same month a Guangdong court sentenced Deng Jiewei to nine months in jail for illegally selling virtual private networks, or VPNs, which protect user privacy by shielding browsing activities from service providers or state surveillance. In July, Apple removed dozens of VPNs from its App store in China, citing compliance with government regulations. In August, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) ordered five websites, including shopping giant Alibaba, to remove vendors that offered access to VPNs. In September, police detained Zhen Jianghua, activist and founder of a website that teaches people how to circumvent internet censorship, on suspicion of “inciting subversion.” In November, in a letter to two US senators, Apple confirmed that it had removed 674 VPNs from its App store in China this year, citing compliance with government regulations. Authorities further tightened screws on social media. In June, they shut down dozens of entertainment news and celebrity gossip social media accounts after calling on internet companies to “actively promote socialist core values” and stop the spread of “vulgar … sentiments.” In August, the CAC announced additional new regulations on the requirement of real-name registration. In September Weibo barred users who had not registered with their real names from posting messages on their own microblogs or comment on others. In September, the CAC promulgated measures to make creators of online chat groups such as those on QQ and Wechat liable for information other users shared in the groups. The rules also require the service providers to establish credit rating systems for chat group users. Those who violate Chinese laws and regulations will have their credit scores lowered. In September, Beijing police arrested Liu Pengfei, the creator of a WeChat group that had discussed political and social issues. Authorities continued their assault on academic freedom. In January, Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou banned staff from criticizing the Communist Party. In June, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the party’s disciplinary body, issued a report accusing 14 top universities of ideological infractions after a months-long investigation. Several professors were fired for speaking critically of the Chinese government on social media. In August, Shi Jiepeng, a professor of classical Chinese at Beijing Normal University, was sacked for “improper comments”; Shi had called Mao Zedong a “devil.” ((ul))In August, Cambridge University Press admitted it had ((/ul))((ul))((hl))blocked access in China to more than 300 articles published in its journal China Quarterly((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), following orders from the Chinese government. ((/ul))The international backlash against the decision compelled the publishing house to restore the articles. In November, Springer Nature pulled access to over 1,000 articles in China. The publisher said the decision was to comply with Chinese regulations. In March, authorities issued new measures to reduce the number of foreign children’s titles published in Chinese. In August, the Ministry of Education issued new national editions of primary and middle school liberal arts textbooks, with added emphasis on traditional culture and “core socialist values.” Gui Minhai, a Swedish national and publisher of books critical of the Chinese leadership, was abducted in Thailand in October 2015. After holding Gui for two years in secret detention in China, the Chinese government in October told Swedish diplomats that Gui had been “released.” Hong Kong ((ul))Civil liberties in Hong Kong are increasingly being undermined by the growing interference of the central government((/ul)), 20 years after the city returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. ((ul))Opposition political parties and their supporters faced greater harassment from authorities.((/ul)) In April, the Companies Registry rejected the application of the Hong Kong National Party on grounds that the promotion of “Hong Kong independence is against the Basic Law.” During President Xi’s visit to Hong Kong, local and mainland police followed, harassed, and arrested some peaceful pro-democracy protesters. ((ul))In April, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Hong Kong police arrested 11 pro-democracy advocate((/hl))((/ul))((ul))s on charges including “unlawful assembly” and “obstructing police((/ul)).” The charges stem from the advocates’ protest against a decision by China’s top legislative body forcing Hong Kong courts to disqualify two pro-independence legislators. In July, a Hong Kong court disqualified four more pro-democracy lawmakers for modifying their oaths swearing allegiance to China in a 2016 ceremony. In ((ul))March, two mainland government advisers said the central government will rely more on “legal means”—suggesting manipulation of the territory’s legal system—to strengthen central control. ((/ul))In April, the chief of legal affairs at the China Liaison Office in Hong Kong said the “one country, two systems” principle could be abolished altogether if the city “fails to actively defend the sovereignty” of China. In June mainland officials declared that the Sino-British Joint Declaration, which states that Hong Kong enjoys “a high degree of autonomy” except in foreign affairs and defense, “no longer has any realistic meaning.” In August, a Hong Kong appeals court sentenced pro-democracy student leaders Alex Chow, Nathan Law, and Joshua Wong to six to eight months in prison. The three had earlier been convicted of crimes related to “unlawful assembly” for peaceful protests at the time of the 2014 Umbrella Movement, and were given community sentences by a lower court. In a politically motivated move, the secretary of justice, a political appointee, sought a harsher prison sentence for the trio. Also in August, the same court convicted 13 defendants of unlawful assembly for another anti-government protest in 2014. The 13, who had previously been sentenced to community service, were given prison terms of between 8 and 13 months after the Justice Department sought a review of their sentences. In October, the Court of Final Appeal released Chow, Law, and Wong on bail, pending appeal. Xinjiang ((ul))The Chinese government has long conflated peaceful activism with violence in Xinjiang, and has treated many expressions of Uyghur identity, including language and religion, as threatening. ((/ul))Uyghur opposition to government policies has been expressed in peaceful protests but also through violent attacks. However, details about protests and violence are scant, as authorities severely curtail independent reporting in the region. In 2017, the Chinese government continued its 2014 “strike-hard” campaign in Xinjiang, which vowed to adopt “unconventional tactics” in countering terrorism. After Party Secretary Chen Quanguo was transferred from Tibet to Xinjiang in August 2016((ul)), the Xinjiang regional government expanded its already pervasive security measures by hiring thousands more security personnel.((/ul)) In July, authorities forced residents in a district of Urumqi, the capital city of Xinjiang, to install surveillance apps on their mobile phones. In 2017, the Xinjiang government also waged a campaign against “two faced” Uyghur cadres thought to oppose the party’s stance on Uyghurs. In April, 97 officials in Hotan prefecture were reprimanded. Authorities increasingly restricted and punished Uyghurs’ foreign ties. Since October 2016, authorities have arbitrarily recalled passports from residents of Xinjiang. Since about April, 2017 authorities have arbitrarily detained thousands of Uyghurs and other Muslims in centers where they were forced to undergo “patriotic education.” Authorities also ordered Uyghur students studying abroad, including in Egypt, to return to Xinjiang; and in July, Egyptian authorities rounded up those who had failed to return, possibly at China’s behest. By September, about 20 Uyghurs were forcibly repatriated to Xinjiang while 12 were released. Some of those who returned were detained; a Xinjiang court sentenced Islamic scholar Hebibulla Tohti to 10 years in prison after he returned with a doctorate degree from Egypt’s Al-Azhar University. In February, a video believed to be released by the extremist group Islamic State (also known as ISIS) showed Uyghur fighters who pledged to return to China and “shed blood like rivers”—the first reported direct threat by the group against Chinese targets. A 2016 study reported that at least 114 Uyghurs had joined ISIS, but estimates vary widely and the level of participation remains unconfirmed. In April, the Xinjiang Counter-Extremism Regulations, which prohibit the wearing of “abnormal” beards or veils in public places, became effective. Also in April, Xinjiang authorities issued a new rule banning parents from naming children with dozens of names with religious connotations, such as Saddam and Medina, on the basis that they could “exaggerate religious fervor.” Tibet Authorities in Tibetan areas continue to severely restrict religious freedom, speech, movement, and assembly, and fail to redress popular concerns about mining and land grabs by local officials, which often involve intimidation and arbitrary violence by security forces. In 2017, officials intensified surveillance of online and phone communications. Six UN special rapporteurs sent a communication to the government of China expressing concern about the late 2016 mass expulsion of monastics (monks and nuns) and demolition of living quarters at the Larung Gar monastery in Kandze, Sichuan. Similar expulsions and demolitions were reported at the Yachen Gar monastery in Kandze in August 2017. Several thousand Tibetans traveling on Chinese passports to India for a January 2017 teaching by the Dalai Lama were forced to return early when officials in Tibetan areas attempted to confiscate passports, threatening retaliation against those travelling abroad and their family members back home. In June, residents of Palyul county, Sichuan, demonstrated against land grabs; in July and August, Qinghai residents peacefully protested against several official policies. One solo protest in central Lhasa on June 23 ended in the protester’s suicide. Between October 2016 and March 2017, there were at least six protests in Ngaba, Sichuan, alone, but details are scant due to extreme surveillance and intimidation. Tibetans continue to self-immolate to protest Chinese policies. At time of writing, four had done so in 2017. Freedom of Religion ((ul))The government restricts religious practice to five officially recognized religions in officially approved religious premises. Authorities retain control over religious bodies’ personnel appointments, publications, finances, and seminary applications. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))The government classifies many religious groups outside its control as “evil cults,((/hl))((/ul))((ul))”((/ul))((ul))((hl)) and subjects members to police harassment, torture, arbitrary detention, and imprisonment.((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))In February 2017, Beijing police detained Sun Qian, a businesswoman and Canadian citizen, on suspicion of “using cults to sabotage law enforcement.” Sun is a follower of the Falun Gong, a meditation-focused spiritual group banned since 1999. ((ul))Sun was reportedly pepper-sprayed, put in handcuffs attached to foot shackles, and deprived of sleep.((/ul)) In May, authorities detained Shao Zhumin, a Catholic bishop of an underground church in Wenzhou, Zhejiang province. Shao’s church had refused to join the state-affiliated Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association. Beijing and the Vatican have continued negotiations on the normalization of diplomatic ties, but the dialogue remains strained by disputes over who has authority to appoint bishops in the country. In September, China passed revisions to the 2005 Regulations on Religious Affairs. The document, which comes into effect in February 2018, introduces new restrictions designed to “curb extremism” and “resist infiltration,” including banning unauthorized teaching about religion and going abroad to take part in training or meetings. Donations from foreign groups or individuals that are over 100,000 RMB (US$15,000) are also prohibited. The new rules also expand the role of local authorities in controlling religious activities. Authorities in Yunnan province charged more than a dozen Christians in 2017 with “using cults to sabotage law enforcement.” In October, at least three of the charged were given prison sentences of four years. One of their lawyers said the arrests were due to the group not gathering at officially designated churches. ((ul))Women’s and Girls’ Rights ((/ul))According to a report by World Economic Forum, China ranked 100th out of 144 countries for gender parity in 2017, falling for the ninth consecutive year since 2008, when it ranked 57th. The Party Congress, concluded in October, was marked by a striking absence of women in top political posts. ((ul))((hl))Women and girls in China continue to confront sexual abuse and harassment, employment discrimination, and domestic violence((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). ((/ul))The ((ul))((hl))Chinese government remains hostile to women’s rights activism((/hl))((/ul)). In February, internet company Sina suspended the microblog of Women’s Voices, run by outspoken feminists, for 30 days. Between May and June, Guangzhou police forced five activists from their homes in retaliation for their campaign to raise awareness about sexual harassment on public transportation. In September, authorities finally lifted a 10-year travel ban on activist Wu Rongrong, enabling her to travel to Hong Kong for studies. Disability Rights China ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2008. However, persons with disabilities continue to face discrimination in areas including education and employment. In February, authorities released long-awaited Regulations of Education of Persons with Disabilities to replace out-of-date 1994 regulations. While the new regulations have some positive aspects, they do not go far enough in removing discriminatory obstacles that prevent many children with disabilities from being placed in mainstream schools. They require that students with disabilities be evaluated by a quasi-governmental expert committee and placed according to their “physical conditions and ability to be educated and adapt to [mainstream] schools.” Preventing children with disabilities from attending mainstream schools, or failing to provide them with support needed to attend such schools, is itself a violation of the CRPD. In March, state press reported the death of a 15-year-old with autism in a Guangdong “care center” for the homeless, focusing attention on neglect in these facilities. In a welcome move in April, the Ministry of Education issued a new rule to accommodate students with disabilities in college entrance exams, known as gaokao. While a 2014 decision already required schools to provide people with visual impairments access to braille or electronic paper in gaokao exams, the new rule provides more details on implementation and includes accommodation for people with other disabilities, including for deaf students. Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity While China de-criminalized homosexuality in 1997, it lacks laws protecting people from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, and same-sex partnership is not legal. In May, Chinese authorities shut down a popular dating app for lesbians. In June, the government banned “abnormal sexual lifestyles,” including homosexuality, from online video programs. ((ul))In July, authorities forced the LGBT group Speak Out to cancel a conference in Chengdu. An earlier Speak Out event scheduled for May in Xi’an was also cancelled after police briefly detained the organizers and told them that LGBT events were “not welcome” in the city.((/ul)) Refugees and Asylum Seekers Beijing also appeared to step up its campaign to forcibly return North Korean refugees and asylum seekers in 2017: between July and August, 41 people were detained; 51 had been detained in all of 2016. Key International Actors While the European Parliament, United States Congress, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, and individual members of governments and parliaments publicly expressed some concern about the deteriorating human rights situation in China in 2017, the response of “like-minded” governments to negative developments, such as jail sentences for peaceful protestors in Hong Kong, was even more muted than in previous years. Although the United States delivered a joint statement on behalf of a dozen countries at the March 2016 session of the UNHRC expressing concern at human rights violations in China, it did not present a follow-up joint statement at any of the council’s 2017 sessions. In January 2017, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres introduced President Xi at an event closed to civil society at the Palais des Nations in Geneva. Guterres made no reference to China’s deteriorating human rights environment or to human rights as a pillar of UN work. At a summit in Brussels on June 1-2, the EU Council and Commission presidents publicly “expressed concern” about human rights abuses in China, but did not call for the release of political prisoners, including EU citizens, or the repeal of abusive laws. The EU did raise concerns about China at the UNHRC in September. In June, German Chancellor Angela Merkel publicly challenged Chinese authorities to fulfill their commitments to register German NGOs under China’s new Foreign NGO Management Law, which went into effect in 2017. Also in June, Italian police briefly detained and later released Dolkun Isa, a prominent Uyghur activist and German citizen, as he tried to enter the Italian Senate, where he had been invited to speak. Italian authorities refused to clarify whether China had requested Isa’s detention. Australia failed to ratify an extradition treaty with China after protests from Australian politicians arguing Australia should not send people to China because the country's judicial system is plagued with human rights abuses. Businessmen linked to China’s government have made significant foreign donations to political parties in Australia, raising concerns about Chinese attempts to influence Australian policy. An Australian parliamentary inquiry in March called for a ban on political donations from foreign sources, and the government ordered a review of espionage laws. In July, the United States issued several statements condemning China’s failure to allow Liu Xiaobo the freedom to seek medical treatment wherever he chose. Yet within hours of Liu’s death US President Donald Trump referred to President Xi as a “terrific guy” and “a great leader.” Foreign Policy In May, China hosted its largest-ever gathering for the “One Belt, One Road” (OBOR) initiative, a development program spanning 65 countries that China says will involve investments of more than $1 trillion. Many participating states have a history of countenancing serious human rights violations in major development and infrastructure projects. Key international financial institutions, including the Asian Development Bank, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and the World Bank, have not taken adequate steps to ensure that they place strong human rights conditions on any participation in OBOR-related projects. At the UN Security Council, ((ul))China joined Russia in February in a double veto of a resolution that would have imposed sanctions related to use of chemical weapons in Syria. In September, the council held closed-door discussions on Burmese military atrocities against Burma’s Rohingya Muslim minority; diplomats said China opposed language recognizing the right of return of the more than 630,000 Rohingya refugees who fled to Bangladesh((/ul)). While senior ((ul))UN officials described the military campaign as “ethnic cleansing,” Chinese state media endorsed it as a firm response to “Islamic terrorists.”((/ul))","((ul)) ((/ul))"],"stats":{"highlightedWords":135}},{"tag":"No impact to democracy","cite":"Bruce Fein 14 {Bruce Fein served as associate deputy attorney general and general counsel of the Federal Communications Commission under President Reagan.

((ul))Egypt’s first democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi, proved as much or more contemptuous of the rule of law, human rights and amity towards Israel and the United States than his dictatorial predecessor, Hosni Mubarak.((/ul)) Thus, the United States shed only crocodile tears when he was overthrown in a military coup. Adolf Hitler climbed to power through popular elections. His Nationalist Socialists captured more than 37 percent of the vote in 1932 to become the largest party in the Reichstag. Free and fair elections in Saudi Arabia would yield victory for radical Islamic parties with affinity and sympathy for the murderous perpetrators of 9/11. In sum, promoting democracy in foreign lands may aggravate rather than diminish threats to perceived interests of the United States. Thus, we have supported dictators over democrats in Iran, Guatemala, Chile, Indonesia, Argentina, Bahrain, Kuwait, Cambodia, Brazil, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Spain, the Philippines, ad infinitum. In any event, ((ul))((hl))democracy promotion is overwhelmingly a fool’s errand.((/hl))((/ul))((hl)) ((/hl))The process is vastly too complex for us to master or to jump start. Sending nations copies of the Declaration of Independence and Constitution will not do. Words without a reinforcing political culture are worthless. Iraq’s Constitution prohibits laws that contradict the “principles of democracy.” But Salmon Rushdie would be killed if he attempted to sell The Satanic Verses in Baghdad. ((ul))We also forget that democracy in the United States evolved over more than seven centuries.((/ul)) We cannot expect more from other people. Anglo-American democracy was born with the Magna Carta to check the absolutism of King John in 1215 on the fields of Runnymede. Through succeeding centuries and periodic civil wars, the powers of Parliament strengthened and the powers of the King diminished. Landmarks included the Grand Remonstrance, the beheading of Charles I by Oliver Cromwell, and the English Bill of Rights of 1688. American colonists claimed the rights of British freemen. They soon took on the trappings of democracy with the Virginia House of Burgesses, the Mayflower Compact, the Connecticut Charter Oak, the Maryland Toleration Act, etc. The United States Constitution was not drafted until 1787, more than five centuries after Magna Carta. Democratic principles did not completely triumph until the Civil War Amendments ending slavery and enfranchising blacks, and the Women’s Suffrage Amendment ending their disenfranchisement in 1919. Blacks did not de facto enjoy the right to vote until the Voting Rights Act of 1965, more seven and one-half centuries since the road to democracy began at Runnymede. It was facilitated in the United States by a literate society, a homogeneity of ethnicity, culture and language, natural boundaries, and an unprecedented array of profound and selfless leaders, for example, George Washington and James Madison. Despite these vast advantages, the United States still needed a bloody Civil War and an obscenely prolonged period of Jim Crow before finally achieving substantial national unity and racial justice. In light of our own seven-century journey to democracy, the idea that we can install democratic dispensations in nations that are at the pre-Magna Carta stage of political maturity and lacking our peculiar cultural advantages is delusional. Our miserable track record speaks for itself, including South Vietnam, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Egypt, Burma, South Sudan, Somalia, Syria, and Bahrain. ((ul))Taiwan moved into a democratic orbit in 1988 after the deaths of dictators Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo, and South Korea did the same after military strongman Chun Doo Hwan left office. But these democratic movements were indigenous. The United States was complacent with reliable, friendly, and anti-democratic leadership. At best, democracy promotion is harmless — like shouting at the weather. At worst, it is counterproductive. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Many societies are insufficiently mature, literate, and homogeneous to for its practice. Democracy in these places degenerates into majoritarian, sectarian, or tribal tyrannies notwithstanding formal elections((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).((/hl)) Russia, Iraq, Syria, Libya, and South Sudan are emblematic. Democracy is given a bad name, which may handicap its return at a more propitious time. Our energies should be devoted to purging the evils from our own democracy.

Lynch Decision","((ul))Asylum seekers often arrive with little to no corroborating evidence to support their asylum petition.((/ul))87((ul)) Therefore, their narrative of the traumatic event, or events, is often their main evidence of the past persecution that they have suffered. ((/ul))However, in Ms. Jimenez's case, she provided \"over 400 pages of documentary evidence\" with her petition for asylum, including the police complaint from her 2007 sexual assault, a doctor's report, and a psychologist's report.8 8 The doctor's report stated that Ms. Jimenez had 'visible signs and marks of a strangulation attempt' and a 'torn inner and outer labia of the vagina, evidencing penetration by force or with resistance on the part of the victim.\"'89 Similarly, the psychologist's report mentioned that she showed \"signs and symptoms of tension, worry, fear for her life and the lives of her family[,]\" and recommended that Ms. Jimenez 'be referred immediately to group therapy' to 'help her overcome the trauma.\"' 90 ((ul))Despite having material evidence that corroborated her story, Ms. Jimenez's testimony was still not accepted as credible. This is a reality that many asylum seekers face. Despite their best efforts, their traumatic experiences \"may not be accurately legitimated and accepted by outsiders,\" such as asylum officers or immigration judges.((/ul)) 91 One must consider whether it is possible to effectively judge the credibility of a person coping with trauma within an adversarial system. ((ul))Judges use factors such as demeanor, candor, and the internal consistency of each statement to determine an applicant's credibility.((/ul))92 However, ((ul))these factors can be poor gauges when considering the difficulty many survivors of abuse or persecution have in articulating a linear narrative that effectively summarizes their experiences.((/ul)) 93 Similarly, ((ul))the applicant may feel shame or embarrassment in disclosing the abuse they suffered.((/ul))94 MS. Jimenez personally felt this: she testified \"that she was ashamed and 'embarrassed' to discuss Holguin's abuse.\"95 Similarly, ((ul))a shifting narrative may very well be an applicant's attempt to grapple with the extent of the trauma they have suffered, and thus, they may still be trying to reconcile their situation for themselves. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))In addition to having to accept the facts of their claim for themselves, applicants must also persuade outsiders that they can, and should, be believed((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))As previously ((hl))mentioned, ((/hl))((ul))((hl))the impact of past trauma can affect a survivor's conduct and memory((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul))96 While in detention, Ms. Jimenez did not immediately disclose to her detaining officers that she feared having to return to the Dominican Republic, \"because she was nervous, afraid and ashamed to tell the male officer conducting the interview about her ex-husband's abuse.\"97 Upon expressing her fear of returning, she was given a credible fear interview.98 \"((ul))Ms. Jimenez was confused and nervous during her credible fear interview, and embarrassed to be telling the intimate details of her relationship with Holguin to a complete stranger and an unknown telephonic interpreter.\"((/ul))99 However, despite these barriers, the asylum officer found Ms. Jimenez to have a credible fear of persecution and, thus, she was released. 100 In contrast, the immigration judge was not similarly persuaded and found Ms. Jimenez incredible based on \"glaring inconsistencies.\"101 ((ul))The issue with the current state of determining credibility within the immigration court setting is that the focus is not actually on the facts of the case, but instead the applicant's unwavering consistency in relaying traumatic details.((/ul))((ul))102 Note that in Jimenez, the immigration judge overlooked the medical report, which noted the injuries Ms. Jimenez suffered due to the 2007 Christmas Eve attack 03 and instead focused on her timeline of those events-i.e., whether Mr. Holguin beat and raped her before or after the party on Christmas Eve.104 Thus, ((/ul))((ul))the immigration judge placed the emphasis on the time of the attack, rather than the actual attack. The persecution suffered was the attack itself, which could be corroborated with the medical report, psychologist's report, and police complaint. ((/ul))The technical issues should not be completely ignored, because finding material inconsistencies may be a sign of a fraudulent asylum claim. ((ul))At the same time, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))minor technical issues should not be the basis of an immigration judge's determination((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), especially where corroborating evidence exists.((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))The Fifth Amendment guarantees asylum seekers, and more generally \"person[s],\"1O5 a due process \"right to have a claim heard by a neutral, impartial arbiter.\"106 The importance of impartiality is reaffirmed in the Ethics and Professionalism Guide for Immigration Judges, which states that judges should perform their responsibilities without showing prejudice.10 7 However, ((/ul))((ul))an asylum seeker's fate will be greatly impacted by which judge presides over his or her case, as well as the region of the United States where the case is heard.((/ul))((ul))108 ((/ul))((ul))While the national average asylum grant rate was 48% in 2015, many regions had much lower grant rates: Atlanta, Georgia (2%), Las Vegas, Nevada (7%), Dallas, Texas (9%), Houston, Texas (9%), Charlotte, North Carolina (13%), and Detroit, Michigan (14%)((/ul))((ul)).109 Similarly, ((/ul))((ul))the United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) noted significant variations in asylum outcomes depending on the court's region and the judge hearing the case.((/ul))((ul))110 For instance, \"affirmative applicants in San Francisco were .. . 12 times more likely than those in Atlanta to be granted asylum.\"111 ((/ul))((ul))Some blame judicial bias and the role of politics in appointing immigration judges;((/ul))112((ul)) others blame a backlogged and broken system.((/ul))((ul))113 ((/ul))((ul))\"((/ul))((ul))((hl))Weighed down by ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))a backlog of more than 520,000 cases((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), the United States immigration courts are ((/ul))foundering, increasingly((ul)) failing to deliver timely, fair decisions to people fighting deportation 11 or asking for refuge.. . .\"((/ul)) 4((ul)) This overwhelming case load also undermines the gravity of the decisions that immigration judges are being asked to make. ((/ul))((ul))115 ((/ul))((ul))The years of waiting((/ul))((ul)) injure asylum seekers because they ((/ul))((ul))face the reality that their evidence may become stale and their memory of past events will decay. ((/ul))((ul))For Ms. Jimenez, her hearing occurred in 2013, but many of the relevant events that she was expected to relay in detail occurred between 2007 and 2009.116 ((/ul))((ul))There was an expectation that Ms. Jimenez be able to remember and articulate, in a linear narrative, specific details of events that had happened nearly four to six years prior.((/ul))((ul))117 In her case, the immigration judge was concerned about discrepancies as to details, such as what time of day she was raped on Christmas Eve in 2007, the exact date she was last raped, the location she was last raped, and whether Mr. Holguin had hit her son.118 There are general issues confronting a survivor's ability to articulate a linear narrative regarding traumatic events, but ((/ul))((ul))((hl))these issues may also be compounded by the long length of time it takes to get a h((/hl))((/ul))((ul))earing.((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))Aside from the problems created by the backlog of cases, ((/ul))((ul))there are also disparities in denial rates within jurisdictions that make judicial bias, political sway, and general inexperience more likely culprits.((/ul))((ul)) For instance, in July 2006, Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a research organization associated with Syracuse University, released a study stating that Chinese immigrants make up almost twenty-two percent of asylum seekers in the United States.119 The study found that in New York there was a grave disparity in the grant rates for Chinese asylees represented by lawyers-one judge denied almost seven percent of petitions, while another denied ninety-four percent. 120 ((/ul))((ul))Circuit courts have questioned the skill and temperament of some immigration judges, mainly those who have been repeatedly appealed((/ul))((ul)).121 Note that ((/ul))((ul))\"[a]((/ul))((ul))bout((/ul))((ul)) half of the judges appointed in [the] 2004-2007 period had no experience with immigration law.((/ul))((ul))\"122 The purpose of the credible fear interview is to \"identify potentially meritorious claims to protection.\"1 23 Similarly, ((/ul))((ul))USCIS training materials describe the credible fear interview as simply a \"screening process,\"((/ul))((ul))1 24 ((/ul))((ul))yet((/ul))((ul)) in Ms. Jimenez's case((/ul))((ul)), the notes from her credible fear interview held substantial weight before the immigration judge.((/ul))((ul))125 ((/ul))((ul))The inconsistencies between these notes and the applicant's testimony often serve as the basis for adverse credibility findings without much concern about the reliability of those notes.((/ul))((ul))126 In Jimenez, the Seventh Circuit found that Ms. Jimenez had consistently maintained that Mr. Holguin raped her on Christmas Eve and that the medical report corroborated her claim.127 Thus, the possible discrepancies-regarding the precise time of day that the violence occurred-between the interview notes and Ms. Jimenez's testimony, asylum application, and corroborating evidence was found to be a trivial discrepancy for the immigration judge to use as the basis for an adverse credibility finding. 1 28 More than that, the Seventh Circuit was concerned by how much weight was placed on Ms. Jimenez's credible fear interview, since it was not a verbatim transcript, and because it should not have been given more weight than ((/ul))((ul))all of((/ul))((ul)) the supporting 129 evidence she provided. Courts should question the reliability of credible fear interview notes due to the nature of those interviews. 130 The asylum officer's notes are the only record of the interview. 131 A verbatim transcript would provide a judge with more insight into the nature of the questions and answers, rather than a simple summary of the dialogue. 132 Similarly, a verbatim transcript would allow the judge to see whether the asylum officer asked relevant follow-up questions to seek more details and information from the applicant. 133 For instance, Ms. Jimenez's responses to some of the asylum officer's questions give the impression that she either \"did not understand [the] ((/ul))((ul))question[((/ul))((ul))] .. . or that the interpretation was unclear to her.\" 134 ((/ul))((ul))If the notes are only a summary, then the judge has no way of knowing whether the applicant's answers were evasive and vague, or whether the asylum officer failed to ask the appropriate follow-up questions to gain more insight into, and details from, the applicant's story((/ul))((ul)). 135 Moreover, a verbatim record would allow the judge to interpret the nature of the interaction between the officer and the applicant. For example, the applicant may indicate reluctance in terms of talking to government officials based on negative experiences in his or her homeland. In Ms. Jimenez's case, she had filed a complaint with the police in the Dominican Republic, and based on this, Mr. Holguin was arrested- but he was released from jail four days later.136 ((/ul))((ul))Ms. Jimenez had voiced a distrust of law enforcement in the Dominican Republic.((/ul))137((ul)) Thus, it would not be difficult to understand that she may similarly have been reluctant to speak to the United States asylum officer ((/ul))138((ul)) regarding a topic as sensitive as past physical and sexual abuse.((/ul))((ul)) In general, these factors come down to verifying that the asylum officer's notes serve as a reliable record of the credible fear interview and, thus, a reliable tool to use in determining an applicant's overall credibility. This approach seems to look at decisions based primarily on credible fear interview notes as being a red flag, therefore, the Seventh Circuit stresses the importance of assessing the reliability of these notes before using them as the basis for an adverse credibility determination. 139((/ul))"],"stats":{"highlightedWords":79}},{"tag":"((hl))Backlog and new proposals circumvent the plan—no ports of entry and credible fear test toughen restrictions((/hl))","cite":"((hl))Dickerson 7/18((/hl)) (Caitlin, national immigration reporter, “Trump Administration Considers Unprecedented Curbs on Asylum for Migrants,” New York Times, 7/18/18, https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/18/us/immigration-asylum-children.html?ref=nyt-es&mcid=nyt-es&subid=article)//jjh","text":["((ul))Mr. Trump has taken monumental steps to shrink the asylum system and discourage people from applying based on a belief that the United States is taking in too many foreigners.((/ul)) The moves are part of a larger plan developing in Washington to reshape the reputation of America as a safe haven, one that has inspired generations of people like Francisco and Miguel to journey here. ((ul))The most extreme proposal yet would upend the system by ((/ul))((ul))eliminating((/ul))((ul)) the use of offices along the border, known as ((/ul))((ul))“ports of entry,”((/ul))((ul)) as asylum processing centers.((/ul)) Introduced this spring by members of the leadership of United States Customs and Border Protection, according to a government official with direct knowledge of the plan, ((ul))it would allow hopeful refugees to apply for protection only from abroad, stranding them for much longer in the conditions they hope to escape.((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))On Wednesday, ((ul))the administration announced new guidance for asylum officers, who are the first to evaluate claims along the border, instructing them to scrutinize asylum applications according to stricter standards, and to weigh the applicants’ claims of fear against whether they have previously entered the United States illegally.((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))“Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems — even all serious problems — that people face every day all over the world,” Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, said last month in announcing a landmark decision to eliminate domestic and gang violence as grounds for asylum.((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))Piggybacking on that announcement, Mr. ((ul))Trump declared on Twitter that he wanted the power to immediately reject people who had no clear basis for asylum at the border, before they could plead their cases in front of immigration judges.((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))“We cannot allow all of these people to invade our Country,” Mr. Trump wrote, “When somebody comes in, we must immediately, with no Judges or Court Cases, bring them back from where they came.” Taken together, the changes are meant to send a clear message to the world: ((ul))As ((/ul))((ul))((hl))a place of refuge, America is largely closed for business((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))The modern asylum system was born during a time of clearly drawn political lines. After World War II, with the wounds of violent discrimination still fresh, the United States and its allies agreed at a United Nations convention in 1951 that accepting refugees was essential to preventing such atrocities in the future. Albert Einstein became one of the original poster children, literally, for refugee resettlement after he was banned, along with all Jews, from academic work in Germany. Mikhail Baryshnikov and other Russian ballet dancers followed decades later when they were famously offered protection from Soviet oppression in the United States and Canada. These cases were clear-cut in the public consciousness: These people were largely fleeing government persecution based on their race, religion, nationality or political views — four discrete categories for asylum under international law — and Republicans and Democrats mostly agreed on helping them. That consensus has dissolved more recently with the expansion of a fifth, much murkier, category of refugees, which has ballooned to protect victims of modern threats coming from nongovernmental entities such as gangs and terrorist organizations. Recently, claims have also been recognized from gay and transgender people in countries that persecute them and female victims of domestic violence in places where the government refuses to protect them. President Trump’s administration is in the midst of a targeted push to turn back the clock. “Asylum is for people fleeing persecution, not those searching for a better job, yet our broken system, with its debilitating court rulings, a crushing backlog and gaping loopholes, allows illegal migrants to get into our country anyway, and for whatever reason they want,” Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, told Congress in May. “This scamming of the system is unacceptable.” ((ul))((hl))More than 700,000 cases are now pending in the American immigration courts, with the largest numbers of people waiting from Mexico and Central America. The ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))growing backlog, plus a shortage of judges((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)), has steadily increased the wait time for asylum and other types of immigration cases, which now take nearly ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))two years((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) on average to complete((/hl))((/ul)), according to data maintained by Syracuse University. One of the biggest blows to asylum petitions came last month, when Mr. Sessions overruled the case of Aminta Cifuentes, a Guatemalan woman who suffered a decade of abuse by her husband that included acid burns and punches to her stomach when she was eight months pregnant. Her baby was born prematurely and came into the world with bruises. Ms. Cifuentes’s lawyers argued that she was the victim of a larger crisis facing women in Central America. They presented a slew of reports by human rights groups as evidence that gender-based violence was a systemic problem that had been ignored by the police, and convinced a panel of judges that the existence of “a culture of machismo and family violence” in Guatemala meant that such women should be considered, for purposes of asylum claims, their own “particular social group.” Similar claims had been approved in the past, at the discretion of individual judges. But after the Board of Immigration Appeals laid down precedent by granting Ms. Cifuentes asylum, women from all over the world began to apply in droves using the same argument. Though the government does not track the grounds of asylum cases, lawyers and judges said that domestic violence had become one of the most common arguments heard in immigration court — until it became a useless one last month with Mr. Sessions’s new guidance to judges. “The mere fact that a country may have problems effectively policing certain crimes — such as domestic violence or gang violence — or that certain populations are more likely to be victims of crime, cannot itself establish an asylum claim,” said Mr. Sessions, who has the power to guide immigration judges on how to interpret the law. Mr. Trump and his allies are also concerned about asylum fraud, as well as the large numbers of people whose claims are denied but who stay in the United States anyway, slipping into an unauthorized life in the shadows. ((ul))Of total asylum claims, which increased 1,700 percent between 2008 and 2016, ((/ul))Secretary Nielsen told Congress, ((ul))only 20 percent of applications are finally approved by a judge.((/ul)) “So our concern is that there’s a lot of fraud,” she said. ((ul))She pointed to the ever-growing number of people who journey to the United States because they believe wrongly that the doors of asylum are open to anyone.((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))“It doesn’t mean that you made a fraudulent claim, it could just mean that you believe that you can seek asylum, for example, for family reunification,” she added. ((ul))“But our laws don’t allow you to seek asylum for the sole purpose of family reunification.”((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))At shelters along the southwest border, false hope is widespread, born of a combination of misinformation and wishful thinking. Asylum seekers have been sleeping curled around their belongings on a piece of ground in Nogales that marks the last patch of Mexico, waiting to be interviewed by American officials. In interviews with more than a dozen of these families over several days this month, most seemed to believe that if they attended their court hearings, they would be allowed to work and stay in the United States. Several people indicated that while Mr. Trump may have been separating families in recent weeks, they ultimately had faith that his administration would offer them protection. “This president is going to help me,” said one woman, Mary Montejo, 38, speaking from a shelter in Tucson. “He’s going to help me. I believe in my God, and I believe God has touched his heart.” In Nogales, Gilberto González, 63, a Mexican security guard, was keeping watch over asylum seekers. “This is painful to me,” he said. “They don’t know what faces them on the other side.” ((ul))Other ideas for restricting asylum are being batted around Washington, according to officials at the Department of Homeland Security who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss them.((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))Beyond eliminating asylum at the border, proposals have been floated to further toughen the “credible fear” test, which is the first step to winning an asylum case.

If we shift our gaze away from the crisis in Central America that has prompted the large number of children and families arriving at our southern border, we see that many times asylum-seekers arrive alone at an airport, in a port, or via a land border. These asylum seekers—who are claiming their rights to safety after political or personal persecution— must take their place in line as US asylum court dockets fill. ((ul))((hl))These solitary asylum seekers are a very vulnerable population with high levels of psychiatric morbidity, especially depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder((/hl))((/ul)) (Hocking, Kennedy, and Sundram 2015; Quiroga and Jaranson 2005). Importantly, ((ul))many of these single asylum seekers have left spouses and children behind, and even if they are successful in claiming asylum in the USA, they may spend 5 years or longer waiting for asylum and another year or more for permission to reunite with their families.((/ul)) The human cost to them—and to their children—of the extended asylum timeline includes lengthy separation from family (and delays in applying to sponsor one’s spouse and unmarried children who were under the age of 21 at the time the sponsor applied for asylum). ((ul))We have seen this((/ul)), in turn, ((ul))contribute to the following: enormous stress on the family unit (e.g., emotional, financial, childrearing, forced separation of family unit), loved ones back in the homeland having difficulty understanding why there is a delay (and, in some cases, not believing that the applicant is really trying to sponsor them), break up of marriages, and persecution of family members (including children) of torture survivors who remain in the homeland ((/ul))(Berthold 2015). When asylum seekers flee their countries of origin, ((ul))authorities may target their loved ones back home ((/ul))((ul))in an effort to((/ul))((ul)) find or punish the torture survivor who escaped((/ul)) (Berthold 2015). ((ul))Sometimes such asylum seekers may not know if their loved ones are dead or alive((/ul)) (Akinsulure-Smith and O’Hara 2012). ((ul))The persecution of family members left behind may take many forms including threats, intimidation, interrogation, torture, murder, abductions/disappearances, and being forced into hiding((/ul)). In hiding, families typically do not feel safe engaging in normal activities such as working or allowing children to go to school. They may relocate to another part of the country and even sever contact with family and other support systems. In some countries, the authorities have extensive networks, making it hard to hide anywhere in the country. Knowing this risk to their family members, asylum-seekers in the USA may be left in a state of fear and guilt due to their sense of having made family members targets of persecution. ((ul))The asylum-seeker carries this burden even if his or her family members remain safe because the vulnerability is ((/ul))((ul))everpresent((/ul))((ul)). ((/ul))There are additional implications of the backlog, including a denial of a speedy resolution of the asylum seeker’s case. Asylum seekers are systematically denied the right to work((ul)) (((/ul))UDHR, Article 23(1)), at least for the first 6 months after applying for asylum. ((ul))((hl))Without legal authorization to work, asylum applicants’ ability to support themselves and their family is jeopardized((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). If they do work under the table without a work permit, they can experience legal problems and may become increasingly vulnerable to exploitation and trafficking, including labor trafficking. Asylum seekers are also denied the right to access healthcare (including mental health care) until their asylum is granted. This deprives them of their right to the highest attainable standard of health((/ul)) (UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 2000). Few health providers currently extend health services to the undocumented, with the exception of some large community based clinics and county health facilities. Obtaining coverage for emergency care for children is sometimes possible (through emergency Medicaid/Medical). ((ul))Those who flee from persecution are at risk of experiencing psychological distress, and the stress of being in limbo waiting for the adjudication of one’s immigration case may prolong the uncertainty of whether they will be deported back to where they are at risk of being tortured or killed. Such circumstances can exacerbate psychological conditions and lead to hopelessness and despair. ((/ul))Further,((ul)) a long wait for asylum may compromise the psychological recovery process for trauma/torture survivors, thereby reducing their quality of life and well-being ((/ul))(Berthold 2015). Conclusions and Recommendations The USCIS change of policy that prioritized processing of cases of unaccompanied children and other Central American families has had the effect of slowing down the asylum process for all other asylum applicants. Of course, we agree that the US government must direct resources to these children and their families, but it is unfair and unethical to divert resources from other vulnerable children and their families. Who can say whether a Central American child waiting in detention in Texas is at greater or more urgent risk than a child of a political dissident waiting behind in Ethiopia or Iraq? It is inappropriate to compare trauma and hardship across groups. Instead, we are in favor of a speedy resolution to all asylum cases, especially if those cases involve children—and whether those children are present in this country or abroad. Although we do not see their faces because they are waiting in their home countries for their parent to receive asylum (and then apply for family reunification((hl))), ((/hl))((ul))((hl))the children of asylum-seekers also suffer when their parent’s asylum cases are put on hold or administratively closed, in effect delaying the parent’s eligibility to sponsor family members((/hl))((/ul)) (Haile 2015).

Whereas ((ul))a common feminist frame for violence against women is that it is based on structural gender inequality, the shift to culture deemphasizes it as a root cause((/ul)). In her analysis of national debates in Sweden, de los Reyes finds that violence against women is either explained as an expression of traditional cultural patterns within immigrant communities or as a result of universal, structurally unequal gender power relations (de los Reyes 2003).

Analyzing human rights processes at UN level, Merry (2003, 974; 2006) argues that ((ul))transnational elites in these settings often locate culture at the local, rural level and not among themselves, as “out there, in the hinterland, with the minorities, while here there is law, with culture hiding from view, buried in the everyday practices of modernity((/ul)).” From any perspective of “us”, minority groups tend to be viewed as more cultural (Phillips 2007).

Narayan argues that ((ul))although domestic violence murders in the United States are as numerically significant as dowry deaths in India, only one is seen as cultural backwardness((/ul)). In Europe, ((ul))femicides resulting from domestic violence are more prevalent than honor killings; yet, the outrage for honor killings is much greater((/ul)).

However, the ((ul))risks involved in the treatment of gender policy measures by technocrats have to do with the potential “depoliticization” of the issue of gender inequality altogether((/ul)) (Squires 1999; 2005). ((ul))This could ((/ul))((ul))((hl))result((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) both ((/ul))((ul))((hl))from the presentation of gender equality measures as technical procedures that include no political conflict((/hl))((/ul)) and contestation, ((ul))and from the exclusion of more radical feminist voices from the policymaking process((/ul)) (Squires 2005 and Verloo 2005a).

While this duality of directions is used to describe and criticize a signalled “technocratization” of gender mainstreaming, it also has been criticized as a false dichotomy (Walby 2005). In some cases, the two sides do not necessarily oppose one another as much as reveal the political experiences of the formation of “velvet triangles” among femocrats, academics, and the feminist movement (Woodward 2004). These include, for example, Northern Ireland’s “participatory-democratic” approach to mainstreaming, based on the participation of civic groups in the policymaking process through consultations and hearings (Barnett-Donaghy 2003), and practices like the UK Women’s Budget Group,2 in which a union of academics, civil society, and policymakers has contributed to progress in the gendering of the government budget (Walby 2005). These examples also point at some problems connected to more democratic approaches to gender mainstreaming, such as questions of resources and timing especially (Donaghy 2003).

((/ul))((ul))((hl))The right to have a voice in the framing of a policy issue is connected strictly to matters of ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))power,((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) and((/ul))((ul)) related to the actual inclusion or exclusion of actors in/from the political debate((/ul)) (Phillips 2003; Marx Ferree and Gamson 2003; and Lister 2005).

This obligation is contained in the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. ((ul))((hl))The United States is a party to the Protocol and has committed to comply with the Convention’s protections for refugees.142 UNHCR has stated that asylum applications should be processed in a timely manner, condemning nations that do not have a just and efficient asylum processing system((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).143((/ul)) The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which the United States has signed and ratified, preserves the right of access to the court in Article 14. The United Nations Human Rights Committee (HRC), established to monitor implementation of the ICCPR, says, “an asylum seeker must be allowed sufficient time to lodge their claim and conversely access to asylum procedures must be granted within a reasonable time.”144 ((ul))Relatedly, the committee also states, “An important aspect of the fairness of a hearing is its expeditiousness.”((/ul))145 Applying the importance of expeditiousness to civil proceedings, which encompass civil immigration matters, the committee says, ((ul))“delays in civil proceedings that cannot be justified by the complexity of the case or the behavior of the parties detract from the principle of a fair hearing.”((/ul))146 It further clarified that where “delays [in civil cases] are caused by a lack of resources and chronic under-funding, to the extent possible supplementary budgetary resources should be allocated for the administration of justice.”147 The application of these principles is illustrated by the committee’s 2003 review of Russia, when it concluded that the two-year delays in asylum adjudications were of particular concern.148 Other countries that receive high numbers of asylum seekers have time limits to adjudicate claims. In 2013, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union issued a directive of common procedures for granting and withdrawing international protection.149 Member states were instructed to “ensure that examination procedures are concluded within six months of the lodging of the application.”150 Under limited circumstances, the state is allowed to extend the processing time to “a period not exceeding a further nine months.”151 Furthermore, ((ul))the directive sets an absolute maximum limit for adjudication of 21 months from the lodging of the application.((/ul))152 U.S. asylum law developed from international law instruments, primarily the 1967 Protocol which the United States embraced in 1968. To fulfill its international obligations under the 1967 Protocol, Congress enacted the Refugee Act of 1980, which incorporated key provisions of the Refugee Convention into the Immigration and Nationality Act. Importantly, the Refugee Act incorporated the refugee definition from the Convention and established uniform procedures for the treatment of asylum claims in the United States.153 U.S. law provides two indications of time limitations on the initial adjudications of asylum claims. First, initial interviews or hearings on asylum applications “shall commence no later than 45 days after the date an application is filed,” in the absence of exceptional circumstances.((ul))154 Statute also dictates that in the absence of exceptional circumstances, final administrative adjudication of the asylum application, not including administrative appeal, shall be completed within 180 days after the date an application is filed.”155 According to the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), as of September 2015, 61 percent of the over 100,000 pending applications at the asylum office have exceeded the 180-day requirement.((/ul))156 From 2010 to 2014 the number of affirmative asylum applications adjudicated past the 180-day requirement nearly doubled.157 For asylum cases adjudicated before the immigration courts, there is no statutorily imposed timeline. However, constitutional due process rights may demand the need for additional resources for the immigration courts, such that cases can be afforded adequate consideration by judges with caseloads that allow for fair and meaningful adjudication. The Immigration and Nationality Act includes a guarantee that “the alien shall have a reasonable opportunity to examine the evidence against the alien, to present evidence on the alien’s own behalf, and to crossexamine witnesses presented by the Government.”158 The Seventh Circuit indicates that immigration court procedures “must satisfy currently prevailing notions of fairness.”159 That court has also characterized the due process rights of immigrants to include the right to “meaningfully present” evidence in a “meaningful way.”160 Scholars argue that in order for judicial fact-finding to be conducted in a meaningful way, immigration judges must have sufficient time to review documentation and access witnesses. In an interview conducted by Dr. Alicia Triche and published in 2015, Judge Dana Marks, president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, indicated the following: A typical workweek includes 36 hours on the bench and a meager four hours of time spent in chambers. That is four hours to review documentation for every individual case occurring that week—a total that, especially if a law school or large firm is involved, can span hundreds or even thousands of pages.161 Limited time to review complex cases with often life threatening implications leads Judge Marks to characterize immigration court as “death penalty cases in a traffic court setting.”162 Ballooning backlogs cause immigration judges to face a growing number of pending cases, and increased pressure to examine them as expeditiously as possible. The large caseloads threaten the fundamental fairness required by due process. Conclusion Protecting refugees is a core American ideal, central to the country’s identity and history. As the asylum and immigration court systems struggle with large backlogs, those who need America’s protection suffer in a state of perpetual limbo.

Other deportation cases involve defenses such as people who have children who are U.S. citizens or people who are victims of domestic violence. ((/ul))((ul))Legal experts say a combination of staffing shortages, a 2014 influx of Central American immigrants — their cases have been prioritized by the immigration review office to move ahead of others((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))— and a global refugee crisis have created a perfect storm. The backlog has stretched out the wait times for immigrants hoping to stay in the country, ((/ul))((ul))leaving them in legal limbo for years as they await their day in court((/ul))((ul)). At Chicago's courthouse, ((/ul))((ul))the average case has a wait time of 1,046 days((/ul))((ul)), according to the Syracuse clearinghouse. \"We've been dealing with backlogs here in Chicago for a number of years now, and we've just seen them get increasingly worse,\" attorney Ashley Huebner said. Huebner manages the National Immigrant Justice Center's Asylum Project, a legal clinic that handles many of Chicago's asylum cases. In Illinois, hearings are held at the main Chicago courthouse and several detention centers statewide. \"Our court is basically grinding to a halt at this point,\" she said. At the end of fiscal year 2011, there were nine immigration judges in Chicago, according to Kathryn Mattingly, an immigration review office spokeswoman. That number had dropped to five by early 2016. A sixth judge was added in April. ((/ul))((ul))Immigrants rush to apply for citizenship in last window before election ((/ul))((ul))At((/ul))((ul)) any time, these judges can also be re-assigned from their regular court dockets to hear the cases of people who are being held in detention centers, lengthening the wait for people like Jaime((/ul))((ul)). There are currently 259 immigration judges across the country's 57 courts. In its report, Human Rights First recommended there be a total of 524 judges to ease the backlog. According to the immigration review office, ((/ul))((ul))this fiscal year's budget includes funding to hire 55 new immigration judge teams. Immigrants can also apply for asylum through the D((/ul))((ul))epartment of ((/ul))((ul))H((/ul))((ul))omeland ((/ul))((ul))S((/ul))((ul))ecurity within a year of entering the country. But according to the Human Rights First report, ((/ul))((ul))the backlog in Homeland Security's eight asylum offices has increased fourfold since 2013((/ul))((ul)). In March, interviews at the Chicago office were being scheduled for those who applied for asylum nearly three years ago. In Los Angeles, that office was scheduling interviews for applicants from 2011. The Human Rights report also recommended increasing the number of officers nationally who handle these asylum applications from 533 to over 700. ((/ul))((ul))I((/ul))((ul))((hl))f an applicant is denied asylum by the Homeland Security office, he can then pursue asylum in immigration court. Backlogs in both procedures mean the total wait time could add up to six years or more.((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) \"It's a ballooning problem in both systems,\" said Shaw Drake, principal researcher on the Human Rights First report. ((/ul))((ul))In addition to staffing shortages, the prioritization of Central American cases is contributing to delays in other deportation cases((/ul))((ul)). These ((/ul))((ul))((hl))other cases are being assigned hearing dates several years in the future and are subject to change as the courts process the priority cases((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul))((ul)) \"The vast majority will be rescheduled for another date, earlier or later, depending on docket availability,\" Mattingly said in a statement. \"(The Executive Office for Immigration Review's) response to the evolving situation on the southern border will continue to adapt appropriately.\" ((/ul))((ul))An increase in immigrants applying for citizenship Many permanent residents, motivated by anti-immigrant campaign rhetoric, are hoping to be eligible to vote for the first time((/ul))((ul)).

Additionally, ((/ul))((ul))asylum applications have increased as more people than ever worldwide are leaving their homes to seek safer conditions, fleeing conflict and instability in countries such as Syria, the Central African Republic((/ul))((ul)), Afghanistan and Somalia, according to a United Nations report.

((ul))ICE found the rape allegation to be unsubstantiated((/ul)). His lawyer has filed a federal civil rights complaint. Menjivar also says he was forced to work for a dollar a day. \"Lots of things happened to me in Conroe,\" he says. He is a 42-year-old Salvadoran who entered the country illegally and is charged with violating a prior deportation. He's out now, fighting to get legal status in immigration court. Menjivar has become a bitter critic of immigrant ((ul))detention centers, which are supposed to be holding facilities for civil matters, not prisons for meting out punishment((/ul)). The forced labor allegations are part of two class-action lawsuits in federal court. GEO \"strongly refutes\" these claims and plans to fight them. In an emailed statement, ((ul))((hl))the company says detainee labor is voluntary and immigrant workers are paid a dollar a day because that's the rate set by ICE((/hl))((/ul)). GEO also says it provides \"culturally responsive services in safe and humane environments,\" and that all of its facilities comply with national detention standards. Here's GEO's full statement defending its facilities: \"GEO has a long history of providing culturally responsive services in safe and humane environments that meet the needs of individuals in the care and custody of federal immigration authorities as confirmed in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Advisory Council report in 2016 on privately operated ICE facilities. As a matter of long-standing policy, GEO does not take a position on or advocate for or against any immigration policies, such as the basis for an individual's detention or the length of detention.\" GEO also rebuts the class-action lawsuit filed in Colorado: \"GEO has consistently, strongly refuted the allegations made in this lawsuit, and we intend to continue to vigorously defend our company against these baseless claims. ((ul))The volunteer work program at all immigration facilities as well as the minimum wage rates and standards associated with the program are set by the Federal government under mandated performance-based national detention standards((/ul)). Our facilities, including the Aurora, Colo. Facility, are highly rated and provide high-quality services in safe, secure, and humane residential environments pursuant to the Federal Government's national standards.\" But these are just the latest grievances against the business of immigrant incarceration. ((ul))H((/ul))uman ((ul))r((/ul))ights groups, including Human Rights First, Human Rights Watch, Detention Watch Network and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights ((ul))have compiled reports of medical neglect and deaths in custody. They claim corporations skimp on detainee care in order to maximize profits((/ul)). \"((ul))I don't get the impression that the Trump administration has any interest in implementing new detention reforms((/ul)). ((ul))If ((/ul))((ul))anything((/ul))((ul)) it looks like they may be eliminating some safeguards((/ul)),\" says Kevin Landy, who was director of the Office of Policy and Planning at ICE for six years. That office tried to reform federal oversight of immigrant jails during the Obama administration. He also advocated for raising the pay rate of a dollar a day, which was set in 1974. \"((ul))I believe contractors save a lot of money by using detainee labor because they're performing work that would otherwise have to be performed by paid employees((/ul)),\" Landy says. That work includes cooking and cleaning the facility. But now, ICE is shutting down Landy's old office and moving the functions elsewhere in the agency. \"It is incredibly scary to contemplate the notion that ((ul))ICE would be removing even the dysfunctional oversight that currently exists,\"((/ul)) says Carl Takei, senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union's National Prison Project. At the same time, immigration authorities want to increase detention space. In its latest budget request, ((ul))ICE has asked for more than 51,000 detainee beds — a 25 percent increase over the last year.((/ul)) It's good business sense to have bed capacity in close proximity to where our operations are.

((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))So((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) ICE is turning once again to the private prison industry((/hl))((/ul)). \"I think what's driving this is the administration wants to make a point that they're serious about immigration enforcement,\" says Lauren-Brooke Eisen of the New York University School of Law. She's author of a new book, Inside Private Prisons. \"They're going to put their money where their mouths are and I think they're going to invest in more immigrant detention centers,\" she continues. ((ul))The two largest private corrections corporations, GEO Group and ((/ul))((ul))CoreCivic((/ul))((ul)), each gave $250,000 to Trump's inaugural festivities.((/ul)) The Obama administration took the extraordinary step of phasing out contracts with private prisons that house immigrants convicted of crimes committed in the U.S. ((ul))The Justice Department found these prisons fall short on safety and ((/ul))((ul))security, and((/ul))((ul)) are no cheaper than those run by the federal government((/ul)). Since Trump took office, the Bureau of Prisons has restored those contracts. And ((ul))ICE is proposing five new private detention centers ((/ul))— in Detroit, Chicago, St. Paul, Salt Lake City and south Texas. Traditionally, ICE has put its jails in border states close to where most people were caught. But immigration agents under Trump have been much more aggressive in the interior. ((ul))((hl))They're psychologically mistreating immigrants((/hl))((/ul)). Douglas Menjivar \"As we continue to have increased operational control of the border, and the numbers of arrests on the border go down, at the same time our arrests in the interior are going up,\" says Phillip Miller, deputy executive associate director for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations. \"It's good business sense to have bed capacity in close proximity to where our operations are.\" ((ul))The changing arrest pattern is good news for private prison companies((/ul)). In a third-quarter earnings call last month, ((ul))a GEO executive indicated that the government's need for additional detention space should benefit company revenues.

We should cheer, but less for the reasons given than those the DOJ left unsaid. In her memo announcing the change, Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates pointed out that ((ul))private prisons “compare poorly” to facilities run by the federal Bureau of Prisons.((/ul)) The DOJ found that, in general, ((ul))((hl))private prisons provide fewer correctional services at greater security and safety risk to inmates and staff, without producing substantial saving((/hl))((/ul))((ul))s.((/ul)) These results are related. ((ul))To achieve their modest savings, private prisons tend to cut back on staff costs and training((/ul)). More than a decade ago, researchers found that ((ul))private facilities pay their officers less, provide fewer hours of training((/ul)) and have higher inmate-to-staff ratios, a combination which may account for their much higher turnover rate among correctional officers, as well as the uptick in inmate assaults. This is the conventional critique of private prisons: ((ul))They do not deliver on their promise of significant savings, and the greater risk far outweighs the small fiscal benefit they provide to those within the walls((/ul)). But the evidence for this critique is mixed. As the legal scholar Sasha Volokh has pointed out, some ((ul))studies have shown that public prisons are more cost-effective than their private counterparts((/ul)), while others suggest the opposite. More importantly, Volokh argues that the private sector can be incentivized to improve—especially compared to the government—and that we should reform the model rather than end the experiment. If we accept the premise that private corporations should run prisons, Volokh’s argument has some force. ((ul))((hl))The real reason we should end the use of private prisons is not the conventional one. The real reason is that justice should not be administered through the prism of profit((/hl))((/ul)). As a rule, we disfavor private prosecutors hired by the victim’s family, or judges who get paid when a defendant in her court is convicted but not when he is acquitted. In both cases, the concern is obvious: ((ul))We mistrust arrangements that might lead actors in the system to stray from their duty to administer justice impartially((/ul)). The problem with the private prison is analogous, though not identical. The ((ul))companies that build and run private prisons have a financial interest in the continued growth of mass incarceration((/ul)). That is why the two major players in this game—the ((ul))C((/ul))orrections ((ul))C((/ul))orporation of ((ul))A((/ul))merica ((ul))and the GEO Group—invest heavily in lobbying for punitive criminal justice policies((/ul)) and make hefty contributions to political campaigns that will increase reliance on prisons. From 1999-2010, for instance, the Sentencing Project found that ((ul))CCA spent on average $1.4 million per year on lobbying at the federal level((/ul)) and employed a yearly average of 70 lobbyists at the state level. In California, where state law requires lobbyists to disclose their contributions in detail, we know that ((ul))CCA used its resources to support, among other things, additional adult and juvenile prisons and detention centers and to oppose a bill that would have outlawed private prisons entirely((/ul)). These corporations have every legal right to shower money on friendly legislators. But the fact that they consider it in their interest to do so is exactly what exposes their troubling conflict. Especially today, ((ul))when the systemic, deeply entrenched, racialized problems with the criminal justice system are increasingly apparent, we should not endorse strategies that encourage the expansion of the carceral state.((/ul)) Regrettably, this was not the explicit message in the DOJ’s announcement. But Yates at least hinted at it. Before pointing out that private prisons “compare poorly” to their public counterparts—that is, before making the conventional critique—Yates noted that the number of federal prisoners has begun to fall, in part because of a shift in law and policy away from incarceration, especially in drug cases. As a philosophical matter, the Obama Administration is trending—albeit haltingly—toward a default preference for non-carceral solutions to crime. The best evidence strongly supports their preference. ((ul))The endless churning of the incarceration cycle—((/ul))the thousands of young men and women repeatedly removed from their neighborhoods, returned and removed again—((ul))((hl))systematically destabilizes the very communities we are trying to save by disrupting the intricate but fragile webs of connection that hold them together((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) In fact, research has shown that ((ul))((hl))high incarceration rates of the sort we have seen since the 1980s not only destabilize disadvantaged communities; they ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))actually increase((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) the incidence of crime((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) That is why former Attorney General Eric Holder recently argued that as a nation, we should aspire to send fewer people to prison for shorter periods. This is precisely the opposite of what the private prison industry wants. While you can perhaps incentivize it to improve, you cannot incentivize a private corporation to go out of business. As long as we have private prisons, their corporate leadership will support policies that fill every bed. There are roughly 115,000 people incarcerated in private prisons: 25,000 in the federal system and 90,000 in the states. A corporation’s bottom line should not determine their fate.

((ul))By stirring up feelings of patriotism, leaders might escape the political costs of((/ul)) scandal, ((ul))unpopularity ((/ul))— or a poorly performing economy. ((ul))One often-cited example((/ul)) of diversionary war in modern times ((ul))is Argentina’s 1982 invasion of the Falklands((/ul)), which several (though not all) political scientists attribute to the junta’s desire to divert the people’s attention from a disastrous economy. In a 2014 article, Jonathan Keller and I argued that ((ul))whether U.S. presidents engage in diversionary conflicts depends in part on their psychological traits((/ul)) — how they frame the world, process information and develop plans of action. Certain traits predispose leaders to more belligerent behavior. Do words translate into foreign policy action? ((ul))One way to identify these traits is content analyses of leaders’ rhetoric.((/ul))((ul)) The more leaders use certain types of verbal constructs, the more likely they are to possess traits that lead them to use military force((/ul)). For one, conceptually simplistic leaders view the world in “black and white” terms; they develop unsophisticated solutions to problems and are largely insensitive to risks. Similarly, distrustful leaders tend to exaggerate threats and rely on aggression to deal with threats. Distrustful leaders typically favor military action and are confident in their ability to wield it effectively. Thus, when faced with politically damaging problems that are hard to solve — such as a faltering economy — leaders who are both distrustful and simplistic are less likely to put together complex, direct responses. Instead, they develop simplistic but risky “solutions” that divert popular attention from the problem, utilizing the tools with which they are most comfortable and confident (military force). Based on our analysis of the rhetoric of previous U.S. presidents, we found that presidents whose language appeared more simplistic and distrustful, such as Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower and George W. Bush, were more likely to use force abroad in times of rising inflation and unemployment. By contrast, John F. Kennedy and Bill Clinton, whose rhetoric pegged them as more complex and trusting, were less likely to do so. What about Donald Trump? Since Donald Trump’s election, many commentators have expressed concern about how he will react to new challenges and whether he might make quick recourse to military action. For example, the Guardian’s George Monbiot has argued that political realities will stymie Trump’s agenda, especially his promises regarding the economy. Then, ((ul))((hl))rather than risk((/hl))((/ul)) ((ul))((hl))disappointing his base, Trump might try to rally public opinion to his side via military action((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).((/hl)) ((ul))((hl))I sampled Trump’s campaign rhetoric, analyzing 71,446 words((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))across 24 events from January 2015 to December 2016. Using a program for measuring leadership traits in rhetoric, I estimated what Trump’s words may tell us about his level of distrust and conceptual complexity. The graph below shows ((ul))((hl))Trump’s level of distrust compared to previous presidents((/hl))((/ul)). These results ((ul))((hl))are ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))startling((/hl))((/ul)). Nearly 35 percent of Trump’s references to outside groups paint them as harmful to himself, his allies and friends, and causes that are important to him — a percentage almost twice the previous high. The ((ul))data suggest that Americans have elected a leader who((/ul)), if his campaign rhetoric is any indication, ((ul))will be historically unparalleled among modern presidents in his active suspicion of those unlike himself and his inner circle, and those who disagree with his ((/ul))((ul))goals((/ul)).. As a candidate, Trump also scored second-lowest among presidents in conceptual complexity. Compared to earlier presidents, he used more words and phrases that indicate less willingness to see multiple dimensions or ambiguities in the decision-making environment. These include words and phrases like “absolutely,” “greatest” and “without a doubt.” A possible implication for military action ((ul))I took these data on Trump and plugged them into the statistical model that we developed to predict major uses of force by the United States from 1953 to 2000((/ul)). For a president of average distrust and conceptual complexity, an economic downturn only weakly predicts an increase in the use of force. But the model would predict that a president with Trump’s numbers would respond to even a minor economic downturn with an increase in the use of force. For example, were the misery index (aggregate inflation and unemployment) equal to 12 — about where it stood in October 2011 — ((ul))((hl))the model predicts a president with Trump’s((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) psychological ((/ul))((ul))((hl))traits would initiate more than one major conflict per quarter((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).((/hl))"],"stats":{"highlightedWords":68}},{"tag":"Trump diversion ((ul))outweighs((/ul)) and ((ul))complicates the case((/ul)).

In doing so this briefing focuses on the question of what a Trump presidency might mean for international relations with a focus on nuclear arms, including doctrine and disarmament. This means reviewing policies relevant to the US’s nuclear arsenal and pressing international challenges such as non-proliferation, including in East Asia and the Middle East, as well as the US’s relationship with Russia and its role in NATO. The power and responsibilities of the nuclear monarch The US President is solely responsible for the decision to use the near-unimaginably destructive power of the nation’s nuclear arsenal. Thus, as Bruce Blair—a former intercontinental ballistic missile launch control officer—makes clear, ‘Trump will have the sole authority to launch nuclear weapons whenever he chooses with a single phone call.’ The wider political meaning of the bomb for the world is aptly summarised by Daniel Deudney, who describes nuclear weapons as ‘intrinsically despotic’ so that they have created ‘nuclear monarchies’ in all nuclear-armed states. Deudney identifies three related reasons for this development: ‘the speed of nuclear use decisions; the concentration of nuclear use decision into the hands of one individual; and the lack of accountability stemming from the inability of affected groups to have their interests represented at the moment of nuclear use’. Similarly, Elaine Scarry has explained in stark terms in her 2014 book Thermonuclear Monarchy: Choosing between Democracy and Doom, how the possession of nuclear weapons has converted the US government into ‘a monarchic form of rule that places all defense in the executive branch of government’ leaving the population ‘incapacitated’. In response to this situation, Scarry argues that the American people must use the Constitution as a tool to dismantle the US nuclear weapons system, thereby revitalising democratic participation and control over decision-making. Scarry also outlines the incredible might the president wields, with each of the US’s fourteen nuclear-armed submarines alone carrying ‘enough power to destroy the people of an entire continent’, equivalent to ‘eight times the full-blast power expended by Allied and Axis countries in World War II’. Nuclear specialist Hans Kristensen has described how ((ul))the US’s strategic ((/ul))((ul))((hl))nuclear war((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) plan ‘if unleashed in its full capacity’ ((/ul))((ul))((hl))could ‘kill ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))hundreds of millions((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) of people, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))devastate((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))entire ((/ul))((ul))((hl))nations((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)), and cause ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))climatic effects on a global scale((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))’((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). ((/ul))This war plan consists of a ‘family of plans’ that is aimed at ‘six potential adversaries’ whose identities are kept secret. Kristensen understands that they include ‘potentially hostile countries with nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons (WMD)’, meaning China, North Korea, Iran, Russia and Syria as well as a terrorist group backed by a state that has conducted a catastrophic WMD attack. The ‘dominant mission’ for US nuclear weapons within these plans is termed counterforce, meaning strikes on ‘military, mostly nuclear, targets and the enemy’s leadership’. Despite these plans, the US’s nuclear arsenal is often described by mainstream commentators as being solely intended to ensure mutual assured destruction (MAD), i.e. as part of the ‘balance of terror’ with Russia, in order to prevent armed conflict between the two nations and to ensure a response in kind to a surprise nuclear attack. However, as Joseph Gerson and John Feffer explain, rather than deterrence just being about enough nuclear forces surviving a surprise first strike attack to ensure MAD, US military planners have also understood it to mean ‘preventing other nations from taking “courses of action” that are inimical to US interests’. David McDonough thus describes the ‘long-standing goal of American nuclear war-planners’ as being the achievement of the ability to launch a disarming first-strike against an opponent- otherwise known as nuclear superiority. This has been magnified in recent years as the US seeks to ‘prevent’ or ‘rollback’ the ability of weaker states—both nuclear and non-nuclear powers—to establish or maintain a deterrence relationship. Taking all this into account, the new commander-in-chief’s apparently volatile temperament thus raises deep concerns since his finger will be on the nuclear trigger as soon as he assumes office on 20th January 2017. Given his past experience, Bruce Blair’s statement that he is ‘scared to death’ by the idea of a Trump presidency is but one further reason why urgent discussion and action, both in the US and globally, on lessening nuclear dangers—and reviving disarmament—is vital. A recent report by the Ploughshares Fund on how the US can reduce its nuclear spending, reform its nuclear posture and restrain its nuclear war plans should thus be required reading in Washington. However, as the Economist has rightly noted, ‘It is not Mr Trump’s fault that the system, in which the vulnerable land-based missile force is kept on hair-trigger alert, is widely held to be inherently dangerous’ since, as they point out, ‘no former president, including Barack Obama, has done anything to change it.’ Over sixty years after the nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, nuclearism thus remains very much embedded in the nation’s strategic thinking. Yet the election of Obama, and the rhetoric of his 2009 Prague speech, in which he stated ‘America's commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons’ led many to think that a real change was on the cards. Obama’s visit to Hiroshima earlier this year to commemorate the bombings was thus a painful reminder of how wide the gap is between the rearmament programmes that the US and other nuclear weapon states are engaged in and the disarmament action that they are legally obliged to pursue under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT). Obama himself said in Japan that, ‘technological progress without an equivalent progress in human institutions can doom us. The scientific revolution that led to the splitting of an atom requires a moral revolution as well.’ For this statement to be meaningful it is necessary to identify who is responsible for the existing, highly dangerous state of affairs. In short, the US government’s recent record supports Scarry’s suggestion that a democratic revolution is what, in reality, is most needed if the US is to make substantial progress on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. Short-term reforms towards the democratic control and ultimate dismantlement of the US’s nuclear arsenal have been outlined by Kennette Benedict, who writes that the next administration should: place our nuclear weapons on a much lower level of launch readiness, release to the public more information about the nuclear weapons in our own arsenals, include legislators and outside experts in its nuclear posture review and recognize Congress’ authority to declare war as a prerequisite to any use of nuclear weapons. Assessing Obama’s nuclear legacy In order to properly appreciate what a Trump presidency may bring, we need to revisit the range and types of powers bequeathed to the commander-in-chief by previous administrations. Despite the military advances made by China and Russia in recent years, it is important to recognise that the US remains far and away the biggest global spender on conventional and nuclear weapons and plans to consolidate this position by maintaining significant technological superiority over its adversaries, which will, as is well appreciated, push Beijing, Moscow—and thus other regional powers—to respond. Yet spending on nuclear weapons alone is set to pose significant budgeting difficulties for future US governments. According to a 2014 report by the James Martin Center, the Departments of Defense and Energy plan to spend approximately $1 trillion over the next 30 years ‘to maintain its current nuclear arsenal and procure a new generation of nuclear-armed or nuclear capable bombers and submarines’ as well as new submarine launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) and inter-continental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). Arms Control Today has found that total Defense Department nuclear spending ‘is projected to average more than $40 billion in constant fiscal year 2016 dollars between 2025 and 2035, when modernization costs are expected to peak’. Including costs for the Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration’s projected weapons-related spending during this period ‘would push average spending during this period to more than $50 billion per year’. If anywhere near these sums are spent, then the modest reductions to the US’s nuclear stockpile achieved during the Obama presidency will be entirely overshadowed. Moreover, as analyst Andrew Lichterman notes, the US’s continued modernisation of its nuclear forces is ‘inherently incompatible’ with the ‘unequivocal undertaking’ given at the 2000 NPT Review Conference to eliminate its nuclear arsenal and apply the ‘principle of irreversibility’ to this and related actions. For Lichterman, the huge outlays committed to the nuclear weapons complex were part of a political ‘bargain’ made by the Obama administration with Republicans. This ensured that the New START nuclear arms control treaty would pass in the Senate whilst also not disturbing the development of missile defense and other advanced conventional weapons programmes. New START is a bilateral agreement between Russia and the US, which Steven Pifer describes as ‘one of the few bright spots’ that exists in these nations’ relationship. Under the treaty Moscow and Washington must, by 2018, reduce their stockpile of operationally deployed strategic nuclear warheads to 1,550. Furthermore, both must keep to a limit of 700 deployed strategic launchers (missiles) and heavy bombers, and to a combined limit of 800 deployed and non-deployed strategic launchers and heavy bombers. Despite New START ‘proceeding smoothly’ according to Pifer, Hans Kristensen recently produced a report comparing Obama’s record with that of the previous presidents holding office during the nuclear age, which found that, hitherto, Obama has cut fewer warheads—in terms of numbers rather than percentages—than ‘any administration ever’ and that ‘the biggest nuclear disarmers’ in recent decades have been Republicans, not Democrats. Kristensen thus drily observes of this situation that, a conservative Congress does not complain when Republican presidents reduce the stockpile, only when Democratic president try to do so. As a result of the opposition, the United States is now stuck with a larger and more expensive nuclear arsenal than had Congress agreed to significant reductions. As his presidency draws to a close, presumably as a means of securing some sort of meaningful legacy in this area, it has been reported that Obama considered adopting a no first use (NFU) policy for nuclear weapons, something which, whilst reversible, could act as a restraint on future presidents. Yet this was apparently abandoned, according to the New York Times, after ‘top national security advisers argued that it could undermine allies and embolden Russia and China’. Furthermore, according to Josh Rogin of the Washington Post, the governments of Japan, South Korea, France and Britain all privately communicated their concerns about Washington adopting NFU. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter is also said to have argued that such a move would be unwise because ‘if North Korea used biological weapons against the South the United States might need the option of threatening a nuclear response’. However, as Daryll Kimball explains, the US’s ‘overwhelming’ conventional military advantage means that ‘there is no plausible circumstance that could justify—legally, morally, or militarily—the use of nuclear weapons to deal with a non-nuclear threat’. Such resistance to NFU is thus deeply disappointing given that, as Kimball goes on to note, this move would go some way to reassuring China and Russia about the US’s strategic intentions. It would also be an important confidence-building measure for the wider community of non-nuclear weapon states, showing that the US is willing to act in 'good faith' towards its disarmament obligations under the NPT. Thinking about the causes of proliferation more widely requires us to understand what drives weaker states to seek deterrents, if their reliance on them is to be reduced. For example, as Dr Alan J. Kuperman observes, NATO’s bombing and overthrow of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 ‘greatly complicated the task of persuading other states such as Iran and North Korea ‘to halt or reverse their nuclear programs’. The lesson Tehran and Pyongyang took is thus that because Gaddafi had voluntarily ended his nuclear and chemical weapons programmes, the West now felt free to pursue regime change. When assessing the importance of the Iran nuclear deal, which is often hailed as one of Obama’s landmark achievements, and which the next President must not be allowed to derail, it is thus important also to consider carefully what behaviour by the most powerful states will enable existing or potential nuclear possessors to embrace disarmament and reduce their interest in seeking non-conventional deterrents. The inability of Washington to make substantial progress towards reducing the salience of nuclear weapons at home and abroad is all the more noteworthy when one considers the state of US and Russian public opinion on nuclear arms control and disarmament. As John Steinbrunner and Nancy Gallagher observe, ‘responses to detailed questions reveal a striking disparity between what U.S. and Russian leaders are doing and what their publics desire’. For example, their polling found that: At the most fundamental level, the vast majority of Americans and Russians think that nuclear weapons have a very limited role in current security circumstances and believe that their only legitimate purpose is to deter nuclear attack. It is highly consistent, then, that the publics in both countries would favor eliminating all nuclear weapons if this action could be taken under effective international verification. Another important measure which the US has failed to hitherto ratify is the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). This is despite President Obama stating in 2009 that he intended to pursue Senate ratification of the treaty ‘immediately and aggressively’. Once more, there is notably strong public support–82% according to a 2010 poll by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs—for the US joining the CTBT but, again, the Republican-controlled Senate has blocked the treaty at every opportunity. Overall, the gap between the public’s will and the government’s inaction on nuclear issues is alarming and redolent of the wider democratic deficit in the US. On a more positive note, the fact that the citizenry supports such measures suggests that groups advocating arms control and disarmament initiatives should continue to engage with and understand the public’s positions in order to effectively harness their support. Stepping back from the brink In terms of priorities for the incoming administration in the US, ((ul))stepping back from military confrontation with Russia and ((/ul))((ul))pushing the threat of nuclear war to the margins((/ul))((ul)) must be at the ((/ul))((ul))top of the list((/ul)). ((ul))Whilst much has ((/ul))((ul))been made of a potential rapprochement between Trump and Putin, the two have((/ul)), reportedly, ((ul))only just spoken for the first time((/ul)) on the phone ((ul))and still need to ((/ul))((ul))actually meet((/ul)) in person to discuss strategic issues and deal with inevitable international events and crises, including in relation to Ukraine and Syria. As of now, ((ul))whilst the mood music from both sides might suggest a warming of relations,((/ul)) as has been seen with previous administrations, ((ul))unless cooperation is rooted in a ((/ul))((ul))real willingness((/ul))((ul)) to resolve problems((/ul)) (which for Russia includes US ballistic missile defense deployments in Eastern Europe and NATO expansion) ((ul))then tensions can ((/ul))((ul))quickly re-emerge((/ul)). ((ul))Another related question concerns how Trump will conduct himself during any ((/ul))((ul))potential crisis or conflict((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))with Russia or another major power, given the stakes and risks involved, as highlighted above. Whilst we must wait to find out precisely what the new administration’s approach to international affairs will be, in the past week, NATO’s Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told the BBC that he had been personally informed by Donald Trump, following the election, that the US remains ‘strongly committed to NATO, and that the security guarantees to Europe stand’. Trump had previously shaken sections of the defence and foreign policy establishment by suggesting that NATO was ‘obsolete’ and that countries such as Japan (and by extension others such as South Korea and Saudi Arabia) ‘have to pay us or we have to let them protect themselves’, which could include them acquiring the bomb. One reason why some in Washington have, in the past, not wanted their regional allies to develop their own nuclear weapons is because the US might then become dragged into an escalating conflict. Moreover, if an ally in one region seeks the bomb, this may cause others elsewhere to pursue their own capabilities- an act of strategic independence that might make these states harder to influence and control. The US’s key relationships in East Asia and the Middle East illustrate why, if a future US President wishes to take meaningful moves towards a world free of nuclear weapons, then developing alternative regional political agreements, including strategic cooperation with China and Russia, will be necessary. As Nancy Gallagher rightly notes, the ‘weaknesses of existing international organizations’ thus requires ‘more inclusive, cooperative security institutions’ to be constructed regionally ‘to complement and someday, perhaps, to replace exclusive military alliances’, alongside progressive demilitarisation. Such confidence-building measures would also support efforts to halt missile and nuclear tests by states such as North Korea, which may soon be capable of striking the US mainland. Imagining the next enemy As well as mapping out the US’s current nuclear weapons policies and its regional relationships, ((ul))it is important to reflect upon how ((/ul))((ul))((hl))domestic political dynamics((/hl))((/ul)) ((ul))under((/ul)) a ((ul))Trump((/ul)) presidency ((ul))((hl))might drive Washington’s ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))behaviour((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) internationally((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), particularly ((/ul))((ul))((hl))given the ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))nuclear shadow((/hl))((/ul)) ((ul))that always hangs over conflicts involving the US. ((/ul))For example, in the near-term, Trump’s economic plan and the great expectations amongst the American working class that have been generated, may have particularly dangerous consequences if, as seems likely, the primary beneficiaries are the very wealthy. Reviewing Trump’s economic plans, Martin Wolf of the Financial Times concludes that ‘((ul))((hl))the longer-term consequences are((/hl))((/ul)) likely to be ((ul))((hl))grim((/hl))((/ul)), not least ((ul))for ((/ul))((ul))((hl))his((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) angry, but fooled, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))supporters((/hl))((/ul)). ((ul))Next time, they ((/ul))((ul))((hl))might be even angrier((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). Where((/ul))((ul)) that might lead is terrifying’((/ul)). Gillian Tett has also highlighted the ‘real risks’ that Trump’s policies could ‘spark US social unrest or geopolitical uncertainty’. Elsewhere, George Monbiot in the Guardian, makes the stark assertion that the inability of the US and other governments to respond effectively to public anger means he now believes that ‘((ul))((hl))we will see war between((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))major powers((/hl))((/ul)) within my lifetime’. If these warnings weren’t troubling enough, no less a figure than Henry Kissinger argued on BBC’s Newsnight that ‘the more likely reaction’ to a Trump presidency from terror groups ‘will be to do something that evokes a reaction’ from Washington in order to ‘widen the split’ between it and Europe and damage the US’s image around the world. Given that Trump has already vowed to ‘bomb the shit out of ISIS’ and refused to rule out the use of nuclear weapons against the group, it goes without saying that such a scenario could have the gravest consequences and must be avoided so that the US does not play into the terrorists’ hands. Looking more widely, President-elect Trump’s existing and potential cabinet appointments, which Glenn Greenwald has summarised as ‘empowering…by and large…the traditional, hard, hawkish right-wing members of the Republican Party’ also point to the US engaging in future overseas conflicts, rather than the isolationism which many in the foreign policy establishment criticised Trump for proposing during the presidential campaign. William Hartung and Todd Harrison have drawn attention to the fact that defence spending under Trump could be almost $1trillion (spread over ten years) more than Obama’s most recent budget request. Such projections, alongside Trump’s election rhetoric, suggest that the new nuclear monarch will try to push wide open the door to more spending on nuclear weapons and missile defense, a situation made possible, as we have seen, by Obama’s inability to implement progressive change in this area at a time of persistent Republican obstruction. Conclusion The problem now, for the US and the world, is that if Trump does make good on his campaign promises then this will have several damaging consequences for international peace and security and that ((ul))if Trump does not sufficiently satisfy his supporters then this will((/ul)) likely ((ul))pour fuel on the flames at home((/ul)), ((ul))which may then ((/ul))((ul))quickly spread abroad((/ul)). The people of the US and the world thus now have a huge responsibility to act as a restraining influence and ensure that the US retains an accountable, transparent and democratic government. This responsibility will only grow if crises or shocks take place in or outside the US which ambitious and extremist figures take advantage of, framing them as threats to national security in order to protect their interests and power. If such scenarios emerge the next administration and its untried and untested President will find themselves with a range of extremely powerful tools and institutional experience at their disposal, including ((ul))((hl))nuclear weapons((/hl))((/ul)), which ((ul))((hl))may prove ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))too tempting to resist((/hl))((/ul)) ((ul))when figuring out how to respond to widespread anger, confusion and unrest, both at home and abroad((/ul))."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":76}},{"tag":"Base support is high and increasing now – the most recent national polls show Trump’s approval rating increasing, especially with Republicans and rural voters who are the core of his constituency – that’s Sparks\nTrump’s base will ((ul))stick with him now((/ul)) – BUT, bashing Dems for being ((ul))soft on immigration((/ul)) is ((ul))key((/ul)) to maintain their support","cite":"Ford O’Connell 6/17/18, adjunct professor at The George Washington University Graduate School of Political Management, \"Donald Trump is delivering on his promises and voters are noticing\", http://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/392653-donald-trump-is-delivering-on-his-promises","text":["((ul))Trump’s ((/ul))((ul))((hl))supporters see him as a man((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))who((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))keeps((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))his((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))promises((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) and disrupts the swamp((/ul))((ul)).((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))They like that he has put in place a conservative Supreme Court Justice and a record number of federal appeals judges in his first year.

Then there is the subject that touches every American — the economy — and Trump is doing so well on that front that even the New York Times had to admit it “ran out of words to describe how good the job numbers are.” Since Trump took office, nearly 3 million jobs have been created, and wage growth is at the highest point since President Bush left office. Unemployment has dipped to its lowest level since 2000 and to record lows for African Americans and Asians. Manufacturing jobs are increasingacross the country, and two-thirds of Americans say the economy is “good.” On top of that, efforts by Obama supporters to give their man credit for the economic numbers have crumbled in recent months. Republican congressional candidates are right to worry whether Trump’s coattails and loyal supporters are enough to keep them in control of Congress beyond this year. The Senate seems safe for now. But the battle for control of the House remains a toss-up, Democrats continue to hold a small-but-stubborn lead in the generic ballot question, and there is no guarantee, particularly as political turmoil in Italy threatens the European Union economy, the economy still will be a political plus come November.

Six in 10 registered voters told Pew that their congressional vote this year will be explicitly meant as a vote for or against Trump, a higher percentage of voters weighing in specifically to send a message to the chief executive than in any of the prior three midterm elections. In 2014, 48 percent of voters said their goal was to give an electoral thumbs up or thumbs down to President Barack Obama. All of the figures above are from June or July prior to the midterm election. What’s particularly interesting, though, is that the split between for and against isn’t as lopsided as one might think. ((ul))((hl))Trump’s((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))approval numbers have been creeping upward((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) of late((/ul)), but he’s still unpopular and faces strong disapproval from a lot of Americans. But more ((ul))((hl))people((/hl))((/ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((ul))((hl))say that their vote is meant to send a message of support((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) for Trump((/ul)) than said the same about George W. Bush in 2006 or Obama in 2010 or 2014. Why? Because ((ul))more than half of those in Trump’s own party say that’s a factor in their congressional vote((/ul)) — the highest percentage of same-party voters to say that’s their motivation since 2006. The percent of Democrats saying their vote is in opposition to Trump is higher than the opposing votes from Republicans in 2010 or 2014 but lower than the enthusiasm Democrats had in 2006 to oppose Bush. It’s important to remember, in case you’d forgotten, that ((ul))just as there is robust disapproval of Trump((/ul)) ((ul))there is also((/ul)) robust ((ul))approval((/ul)) from a smaller segment of the population. We’ve noted before that the combined strong approval and strong disapproval Trump has seen since taking office has been higher than we saw under his two predecessors, with the exception of the bump Bush saw after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. ((ul))((hl))Trump has fostered that((/hl))((/ul))((hl)), ((/hl))((ul))((hl))keeping a ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))deliberate focus on his base((/hl))((/ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((ul))((hl))and((/hl))((/ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((ul))((hl))ensuring that the promises he made to them are fulfilled((/hl))((/ul)). Whether his base would have wavered anyway isn’t clear, but they haven’t. And ((ul))so now((/ul)) more than half of ((ul))((hl))Republicans((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))specifically plan to vote for Republicans to show their ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))support for him((/hl))((/ul)). Another way of looking at how that’s unusual is to consider the gaps between those saying they want to cast a vote for or against the president and the gaps between the opposition and the president’s party. In 2006, both gaps were wide: Much more intent to vote in opposition to Bush than to vote in support and much more energy among Democrats against him than Republicans for him. Compare that with 2018, when the overall for-against gap is the second narrowest since 2006 (minus-8) and the gap between the parties is the overall narrowest (9 points). In 2006, those wide gaps led to the Democrats gaining 61 seats and control of the House. The implication is that narrower gaps may not have a similar result. Except when one considers those gaps in 2010 and 2014. In 2010, the Republicans saw a swing of 126 seats in their direction, with only modest gaps between for and against and between Democrats and Republicans a few months out. We’ve noted before that the surges to the Republicans in 2010 and 2014 happened closer to the election. On June 20, 2010, the Republicans were up half a point in the generic ballot average; four years later, they were tied. They ended up winning 6.8 and 5.7 percent more of the popular House vote in those elections, respectively. ((ul))What happens next ((/ul))((ul))isn’t clear((/ul)). 2018 looks more like 2010 than 2006, but Democrats would be happy with either scenario.

At this point, that's old news. But not everyone has a good grasp on the granular parts of presidential approval?how intensely people feel about the president, which groups do and don't like him and how much that matters for the midterms and our understanding of public opinion in the Trump era more generally.

I looked through their data, did some math, and came up with four different charts that demonstrate some of the most important facts about Trump's approval rating. Before getting started, I have one quick note for readers who might be confused because they have personal experience either making or filling out very non-political polls on SurveyMonkey. This is that same SurveyMonkey ? the company just also usse its platform to conduct scientific political surveys. Mark Blumenthal, head of election polling, explained it to me: \"We draw random samples of those who have just completed a survey on our platform and invite them to answer a few more questions about important issues and current events, including Trump approval\" and then they \"statistically adjust the data so it is representative of the American public.\" So here are the graphics and the explanations: There Aren't (And Never Have Been) Many Lukewarm Trump Disapprovers The conventional wisdom on politics is often wrong. But these polls show that it's right about one thing ? Americans who don't like Trump really don't like him. This graphic shows the percentage of Trump disapprovers who \"strongly\" or \"somewhat\" disapprove of Trump's job performance in a series of SurveyMonkey polls stretching from January 2017 to now. The top line tells most of the story. If you put every American who disapproves of Trump in a room (usually more than half of the people that SurveyMonkey polls) and picked someone randomly, the odds of picking a \"strong disapprover\" would be greater than 3-to-1. This is a problem for down-ballot Republicans. Democrats have won some high profile races (like the special election in Pennsylvania's 18th District) partially by riding strong anti-Trump sentiment. The president has motived Democrats to turn out at a high rate while driving some more typical GOP voters to cast their ballot for the blue team. That anti-Trump enthusiasm is part of the reason Democrats are currently the favorites to take the House in November. ((ul))Trump's Base is More Divided Than Many Think((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))The conventional wisdom is a little less helpful when it comes to Trump supporters.

Indeed, ((ul))there are a couple of reasons to think many white evangelicals will react differently than their leaders who have criticized Trump((/ul)). Understanding evangelicals’ broader perspective on immigration can also help illuminate why this group continues to support Trump so strongly — despite recent scandals that appear to fly in the face of evangelicals’ values.1 First, ((ul))polling on white evangelical Protestants has shown that((/ul)) ((ul))((hl))they’re more likely than ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))any other religious group((/hl))((/ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((ul))((hl))to support ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))hardline immigration policies((/hl))((/ul)) and to have negative views of immigrants overall.

Another Pew survey, conducted last year, found ((ul))that while majorities of nearly every religious group agree that immigrants strengthen our country, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))white evangelical Protestants are((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))more divided((/ul)), ((ul))with a plurality((/ul)) (44 percent) ((ul))((hl))saying that immigrants are a burden((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))These findings line up with results from other surveys too, like a 2017 poll from the Public Religion Research Institute that found that white evangelical Protestants were the only religious group in which a majority (57 percent) said they’re bothered when they encounter immigrants who don’t speak English. They were also the likeliest to say that they have little or nothing in common with immigrants. Daniel Cox, the research director at PRRI,2 said these findings help explain why ((ul))((hl))evangelicals((/hl))((/ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((ul))((hl))aren’t likely to abandon Trump((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) over the child separation crisis((/ul)), ((ul))even if they’re troubled by it((/ul)). “More than other groups, ((ul))((hl))white evangelical Protestants seem to perceive immigrants as a ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))threat to American society((/hl))((/ul)),” he said. “So ((ul))((hl))even if they don’t like this particular policy((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), ((/ul))((ul))((hl))they’re on board with Trump’s approach to immigration in general((/hl))((/ul)), ((ul))and that makes it likelier that they’ll see this as a ((/ul))((ul))tactical misstep((/ul))((ul)) rather than a ((/ul))((ul))breaking point((/ul)).” That’s also how some evangelical leaders have responded; for example, Jentezen Franklin, a Georgia megachurch pastor who serves on Trump’s evangelical advisory council, criticized the family separation policy in an interview with FiveThirtyEight but blamed Congress — rather than Trump — for failing to act. “The president really cares for these families, but to permanently fix the problem, he needs Congress to do their job and work with him on border security,” Franklin said, adding that many evangelicals were drawn to Trump because of his emphasis on reducing the number of undocumented immigrants in the U.S."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":91}},{"tag":"The base doesn’t really care","cite":"Dylan Matthews 6/18/18, Vox politics correspondent, \"Polls: Trump’s family separation policy is very unpopular — except among Republicans\", Vox, https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/6/18/17475740/family-separation-poll-polling-border-trump-children-immigrant-families-parents","text":["Two new ((ul))polls find that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the US government policy of separating children from their parents((/hl))((/ul)) at the Mexican border ((ul))((hl))is((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) very ((/ul))((ul))((hl))unpopular((/hl))((/ul)) with the general public ((ul))((hl))but((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) retains majority support among Republicans((/hl))((/ul)). A new Quinnipiac University poll, released Monday, asked voters, “As you may know, some families seeking asylum from their home country cross the U.S. border illegally and then request asylum. In an attempt to discourage this, the Trump administration has been prosecuting the parents immediately, which means separating parents from their children. Do you support or oppose this policy?” As my colleague Dara Lind notes, this characterizes most of the reason for family separation, though some families seeking asylum legally at ports of entry have also been separated. Sixty-six percent of voters — including ((ul))91 percent of Democrats((/ul)) and 68 percent of independents — ((ul))told Quinnipiac they opposed the policy((/ul)). Whites with college degrees were likelier than non-college whites to oppose the policy, and young people of all races were likelier to oppose it than old people.

Ipsos asked respondents if they agreed with this statement: “It is appropriate to separate undocumented immigrant parents from their children when they cross the border in order to discourage others from crossing the border illegally.” The wording is slightly different from the Quinnipiac poll, foregrounding the deterrence rationale the Trump administration has used to defend the policy. Fifty-five percent of respondents stated they disagreed (42 percent “strongly” disagreed), while 27 percent agreed. As in the Quinnipiac poll, women and nonwhite people were likelier to disagree with the policy; unlike the Quinnipiac poll, differences based on education were minimal, and 18- to 34-year-olds and 35- to 54-year-olds had similar opinions. (People 55 and up were likelier to support the policy.) And as in the Quinnipiac poll, ((ul))more Republicans approved of the policy than not((/ul)) (46 percent to 32 percent). Note that unlike the Quinnipiac poll, the Ipsos poll found only a plurality of Republicans supporting family separation, not a majority. Chris Warshaw, a political scientist at George Washington University, notes that both the Quinnipiac and Ipsos polling suggests the policy is less popular than any major policy proposal of recent American history, including the extremely unpopular Obamacare repeal bills of last summer: [tweet omitted] Nonetheless, the polls find that ((ul))((hl))Trump’s((/hl))((/ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((ul))((hl))core Republican base supports family separation((/hl))((/ul)). But when interpreting party-based polling, one should keep in mind the finding by Emory political scientists Pablo Montagnes, Zachary Peskowitz, and Joshua McCrain that Trump’s unpopularity has coincided with fewer people identifying as Republicans. That could mean that Republicans who disagree with Trump, and in particular his immigration policies, are likelier to identify as independents rather than Republicans now, which in turn artificially inflates support for Trump among self-identified Republicans.

What if there is no longer any evidentiary standard that could overcome the influence of right-wing media? The US is undergoing an epistemic breach Epistemology is the branch of philosophy having to do with how we know things and what it means for something to be true or false, accurate or inaccurate. (Episteme, or ἐπιστήμη, is ancient Greek for knowledge/science/understanding.) The US is experiencing a deep epistemic breach, a split not just in what we value or want, but in who we trust, how we come to know things, and what we believe we know — what we believe exists, is true, has happened and is happening. The primary source of this breach, to make a long story short, is the US conservative movement’s rejection of the mainstream institutions devoted to gathering and disseminating knowledge (journalism, science, the academy) — the ones society has appointed as referees in matters of factual dispute. In their place, ((ul))the right has created its own((/ul)) parallel set of institutions, most notably its own ((ul))media ecosystem((/ul)). But the right’s institutions are not of the same kind as the ones they seek to displace. Mainstream scientists and journalists see themselves as beholden to values and standards that transcend party or faction. They try to separate truth from tribal interests and have developed various guild rules and procedures to help do that. They see themselves as neutral arbiters, even if they do not always uphold that ideal in practice. The pretense for the conservative revolution was that mainstream institutions had failed in their role as neutral arbiters — that they had been taken over by the left, become agents of the left in referee’s clothing, as it were. But the right did not want better neutral arbiters. The institutions it built scarcely made any pretense of transcending faction; they are of and for the right. There is nominal separation of conservative media from conservative politicians, think tanks, and lobbyists, but in practice, they are all part of the conservative movement. They are prosecuting its interests; that is the ur-goal. Indeed, the far right rejects the very idea of neutral, binding arbiters; there is only Us and Them, only a zero-sum contest for resources. That mindset leads to what I call “tribal epistemology” — the systematic conflation of what is true with what is good for the tribe. There’s always been a conspiratorial and xenophobic fringe on the right, but it was (fitfully) held in place by gatekeepers through the early decades of America’s post-war prosperity. The explosion of right-wing media in the 1990s and 2000s swept those gatekeepers away, giving the loudest voice, the most exposure, and the most power to the most extreme elements on the right. The right-wing media ecosystem became a bubble from which fewer and fewer inhabitants ever ventured. As ((ul))((hl))the ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))massive((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))post-election((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))study((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) of((/ul)) online ((ul))media ((/ul))((ul))((hl))from ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))Harvard((/hl))((/ul)) (which got far too little attention) ((ul))showed((/ul)), media is not symmetrical any more than broader polarization is. “Prominent media on the left are well distributed across the center, center-left, and left,” the researchers found. “((ul))On the right, prominent media are highly partisan.”((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))When mapping out sources of online news, researchers found that the two basic poles were the center-left and the far-right. The center of gravity of the overall landscape is the center-left. Partisan media sources on the left are integrated into this landscape and are of lesser importance than the major media outlets of the center-left. The center of attention and influence for conservative media is on the far right. The center-right is of minor importance and is the least represented portion of the media spectrum. In short, ((ul))they ((/ul))((ul))((hl))conclude, “conservative media is((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) more partisan and ((/ul))((ul))((hl))more insular((/hl))((/ul)) than the left.” That insular partisan far-right media is also full of nonsense like Pizzagate that leaves the base continuously pumped up — outraged, infuriated, terrified, and misled. At this point, as the stories above show, the conservative base will believe anything. And they are pissed about all of it. As Brian Beutler wrote in a scathing piece recently, the mainstream media has never learned to deal with the right-wing bubble — it has not learned how not to take bad-faith lies seriously. And now we will all reap the consequences. ((ul))((hl))The incentives facing GOP politicians are not good((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))For Mueller’s findings to have any effect, they will have to break((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))some part of((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the basic dynamic on the right((/hl))((/ul)). Here’s how it works: Pundits and yellers in right-wing media compete to freak out the base and reinforce its allegiance to Donald Trump. ((ul))The base leans on politicians((/ul)). And ((ul))most ((/ul))((ul))elected GOP((/ul))((ul)) officials((/ul)) are in seats safe enough that ((ul))((hl))they fear a primary challenge((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))from the base more than a Democratic((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) challenger((/ul)). ((ul))((hl))The only way to stave off a primary is to pay obeisance((/hl))((/ul)). That’s why Jeff Flake and Bob Corker are leaving the Senate. They no longer have any control over what their constituents believe or want, and their constituents believe and want increasingly ugly things. Sen. John McCain is saying all the right things now, but back when he faced his own Tea Party challenger, he sprinted right as fast as he could. ((ul))((hl))GOP politicians((/hl))((/ul)) cannot (or ((ul))((hl))feel((/hl))((/ul)) that ((ul))((hl))they cannot((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)))((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) cross the base((/hl))((/ul)). And the base is currently being lied to about the Mueller investigation at a furious pace. The entire right-wing machine has kicked into high gear, led by the president himself, furiously throwing out chaff about Comey, Mueller, Obama, Hillary, the dossier, the uranium, the emails, and whatever else. On Monday, Fox News practically had a blackout of the Mueller news. Instead it covered fake Clinton scandals and cheeseburger emojis. It was such an embarrassing performance that multiple people on the news side leaked their disappointment to reporter Oliver Darcy. As always, the goal of this media/political offensive (there is no longer much distinction) is less to present some coherent alternative account of the facts than to fill the atmosphere with fog, to give those on the right enough cover to slough off the charges as yet another liberal plot. (See Vox’s Sean Illing’s great interview with Charlie Sykes, the conservative talk-radio host who criticized Trump and was excommunicated, for more on how this happens.) This reaction to Mueller in right-wing media was predictable enough. Similar things have happened so many times before, and been studied, analyzed, and documented. But to this day, no one knows how to stop or counter it. Mainstream institutions seem as unable as ever to resist its warping effects. It’s all playing out like some morbid script that we can only watch, stupefied. As familiar as this dynamic is, however, this episode is different. ((ul))We are drifting perilously close to a serious constitutional crisis.((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))What if we find out Trump is guilty and just can’t do anything about it? As long as the base is convinced that Mueller is an agent of the deep state (or whatever), it will punish any Republican politician that strays from the pack and criticizes Trump. For a GOP officeholder, standing up for democratic integrity could mean sacrificing reelection in 2018 or 2020. ((ul))((hl))As long as((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) Republican((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))politician((/ul))((ul))((hl))s((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))are frightened by the base((/hl))((/ul)), the base is frightened by scary conspiracies in right-wing media, and right-wing media makes more money the more frightened everyone is, ((ul))((hl))Trump appears to be safe((/hl))((/ul)). As long as the incentives are aligned in that direction, there will be no substantial movement to censure, restrain, or remove him from office. What happens if nothing happens? Mainstream scholars do not think that Trump will be able to get away with simply ignoring Mueller’s findings or pardoning everyone involved. As Andy Wright, a law professor at Savannah Law School, put it, “with each abnormal, unbecoming, or dishonorable act, President Trump makes it harder for his appointees to defend him, harder for traditional Republicans to maintain their uneasy power alliance with him, and easier for Democrats to take the moral high ground and secure political advantage.\" But if there’s one thing non-experts like me have learned over the last few decades of watching US politics, it’s that experts are frequently caught flat-footed by the growing intensity of partisanship and the destruction of norms it has wrought. They are operating based on certain assumptions that it simply doesn’t occur to them that a politician can ignore. But politicians can. Mitch McConnell can simply refuse to hold a vote on a Supreme Court nominee. There’s no explicit rule or law that says he can’t, so he can, and he did. That one shocked and flabbergasted experts too, but just like all the other perverse steps down this road to illiberal lawlessness, they eventually took it on board and normalized it. Now they’re sure Donald Trump can’t simply brazen his way out of an indictment. What if they’re wrong about that? Say he pardons everyone. People will argue on cable TV about whether he should have. One side will say up, the other will say down. Trump may have done this, but what about when Obama did that? What about Hillary’s emails? Whatabout this, whatabout that, whatabout whatabout whatabout? There is no longer any settling such arguments. The only way to settle any argument is for both sides to be committed, at least to some degree, to shared standards of evidence and accuracy, and to place a measure of shared trust in institutions meant to vouchsafe evidence and accuracy. Without that basic agreement, without common arbiters, there can be no end to dispute. If one side rejects the epistemic authority of society’s core institutions and practices, there’s just nothing left to be done. Truth cannot speak for itself, like the voice of God from above. It can only speak through human institutions and practices. The subject of climate change offers a crystalline example here. If climate science does its thing, checks and rechecks its work, and then the Republican Party simply refuses to accept it ... what then? That’s what US elites are truly afraid to confront: What if facts and persuasion just don’t matter anymore? As long as conservatives can do something — steal an election, gerrymander crazy districts to maximize GOP advantage, use the filibuster as a routine tool of opposition, launch congressional investigations as political attacks, hold the debt ceiling hostage, repress voting among minorities, withhold a confirmation vote on a Supreme Court nominee, defend a known fraud and sexual predator who has likely colluded with a foreign government to gain the presidency — they will do it, knowing they’ll be backed by a relentlessly on-message media apparatus. And if that’s true, if the very preconditions of science and journalism as commonly understood have been eroded, then all that’s left is a raw contest of power. Donald Trump has the power to hold on to the presidency, as long as elected Republicans, cowed by the conservative base, support him. That is true almost regardless of what he’s done or what’s proven by Mueller. As long as he has that power, he will exercise it. That’s what recent history seems to show. ((ul))Dem((/ul))ocrat((ul))s((/ul)) ((ul))do not((/ul)) currently ((ul))have the numbers to stop him. They can’t do it without some help from Republicans((/ul)).

As the battle over that new political order is enacted on the national stage, we have all become the dragooned antagonists in the play. This is what it is to live in the realm of the Big Man: his drama perforce is ours.

The latter include not just Stephen Bannon’s “handful of media elites” but many others who are appalled and outraged and find themselves forced to live under the pall of permanent political anxiety that hangs over the nation’s cities. It is our outrage, our disgust, our knee-jerk shock and condemnation that animate the play and give verisimilitude to the battle being fought. We are the enemy and our screams of dismay are vital to the drama. Behind the controversies about crowd size and alternative facts and illegal voters and Muslim bans, all the shock and alarm and political fatigue can be reduced to a dawning horrified recognition that ((ul))President Trump is indeed…Donald Trump. His uttering a thirty-five-word oath((/ul)) of office ((ul))did not magically make him into someone else; he is determined to change the office much more than the office could ever change him((/ul)). How could anyone have doubted that President Trump would be Donald Trump plus great power and not Donald Trump plus great restraint? ((ul))And((/ul)) that he would be((ul)) determined to use that newfound power to begin to do pretty much what he told his base he was going to do((/ul))? And—a final irony—that his very determination to break crockery and spread chaos and disruption is a major obstacle standing between him and the “new political order” whose birth his Svengali Bannon claims he will oversee. The necessity for continual disruption, constant outrage, maintaining an iron grip on the news cycle, and sheer winning without ever retreating means he has a grand proclivity for getting in his own way—“stepping on his own dick,” in political parlance—and we need, not for the first time, to let ourselves be grateful for that. It has thus far proved to be the hated status quo’s most important protection—not least because in very short order he has managed to produce a growing cadre of adversaries within the government itself. Most important, Trump’s aggressive and reckless sallies against intelligence professionals have secured him powerful enemies within the national security apparatus, who have increasingly been making use of their contacts in the elite press—particularly The Washington Post and The New York Times—to fight back and undermine his new administration. This is an important part of the so-called Russia scandal: that the “intelligence services,” in the words of Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, “seem to be at war” with the new president.3 That war has already claimed a high-level casualty in the person of General (retired) Michael Flynn, the president’s first national security adviser, who was fired after only twenty-four days in the job. Though Trump has railed against “illegal leaks” and declared that Flynn “was treated very unfairly by the media,” this side of the story—the bureaucratic war being waged against Trump from within the government—by its nature cannot be adequately told in the press itself, because reporters, however much they resist acknowledging it, in effect are vital players. This storyline is obscured, one might say, by the storytellers’ own shadows. Four weeks of the Trump ascendancy have been an ongoing seminar on where norms end and laws begin, on how much of what we had relied on when it came to the president’s conduct rested largely on a heretofore unquestioned foundation of centuries-old custom. That the president would express respect for the prerogatives of Congress and the judiciary, that he would acknowledge the country’s need for an independent press, that he would generally tell the truth and hold in respect the public record: in little more than the time it took to recite the oath of office much of this has been swept away. Donald Trump is a proud shatterer of these norms, and the louder the crash and splatter the better: for to his supporters such norms are nostrums, antiquated excuses for the elite’s own self-protection, and the wails of outrage and protest mean their hero is doing what they sent him to Washington to do. The norms are gone, perhaps never to be fully restored, and we have advanced now to the laws. The dividing line is surprisingly murky. That the president would not use his office to promote his personal business, for example, depends not only on the so-called emoluments clause of the Constitution but a good many subsidiary norms that Trump began shattering some time ago, when he refused to release his tax returns during the campaign. (His long-standing vow to release them once an audit was completed has been quietly abandoned.4) It seems plain now that in the near term the emoluments clause has in common with these norms that it requires political animation: that it has life only to the degree that those in power are willing to enliven it. ((ul))((hl))Thus far Republicans((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))in Congress, still stunned to find themselves enjoying an undreamed-of monopoly on power and struggling to craft a workable political program not based solely on ressentiment,((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))have shown themselves ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))uninterested((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) in pressing Trump((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) on his business entanglements and seem willing to stand by and let the presidency become a source of great wealth for the Trump family((/ul)). Thus do sacred cows perish, not with a bellow but with a whimper. Ours is famously said to be a government of laws, not of men, and yet we find in the Age of Trump that the laws depend on men and women willing to step forward and press them and that such are not to be found in the dominant party in Congress. Republicans are too divided and too focused on the main chance to move to protect what suddenly appear to be abstract principles. In an age when their party cannot muster a national popular vote majority they find themselves unaccountably in full possession of two branches of government and face the task of mastering their divisions sufficiently to pass a political program that won’t further doom them to the wilderness. This means adopting policies of opposition designed to cultivate and harvest resentment, such as repealing Obamacare, which provides health insurance to more than twenty million Americans, while somehow shaping them into a positive program that they can present to constituents as having improved their lives. It is a daunting task and thus far they show few signs of being up to it. Untroubled by norms, President Trump required only two weeks to come face-to-face with laws in the form not of Congress but of three judges of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Once again banning Muslims was what he had promised his base he would do. That the executive order itself was a legal mess in its drafting and in its execution stemmed both from the modus operandi that the ((ul))Trump((/ul)) team has adopted—policies closely held, drafts jealously sheltered from the eyes of those even in the departments or agencies responsible for carrying them out (taking a page from Dick Cheney’s post–September 11 playbook)—and perhaps from the desire of the president and his advisers to stage a fight with a major institutional force not yet recumbent before him: the judiciary. Thus the president’s assertion of his “unreviewable” powers in the face of “so-called” judges was not just absurd or ignorant but a bit of bait, establishing the basis for blaming the judiciary for any terrorist attack that was to come. On this he tweeted indefatigably and repeatedly: “Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril,” he said in his most explicit tweet. “If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!” Then: “I have instructed Homeland Security to check people coming into our country VERY CAREFULLY. The courts are making the job very difficult!” “People,” of course, are not “pouring in,” certainly not from the seven countries targeted. But the phrase ((ul))links((/ul)) once again ((ul))the country’s vital security to the complex of issues at the heart of Trump’s “America First” politics: trade, immigration, and terrorism. Fortress America is being assailed by((/ul)) foreigners who pour into the country and take our jobs, by ((ul))elite technocrats((/ul)) (“stupid people”) ((ul))who negotiate trade deals that leave our borders unprotected, by traitorous businessmen who move factories abroad((/ul)), and by terrorists who take advantage of the nonexistent immigration safeguards to penetrate our shores. Everywhere the Other threatens. Everywhere the stupid, ineffectual, corrupt, self-dealing elites do nothing to protect the Forgotten American, in effect allying themselves with the threatening outsiders, becoming, in reality if not intent, traitors. As Trump proclaimed from the Capitol scarcely a month ago, “this stops, right here and right now.” But now “so-called judges” stand in the president’s way. The president will likely get his immigration ban, in one form or another, by backing up, rewriting the executive order, and proclaiming victory. Commentators will bemoan the fiasco that his first immigration rollout became. But Trump will have established the precedent of saddling the judiciary with responsibility for the next attack. Jack Goldsmith, the former head of the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel under George W. Bush and now a professor at Harvard Law School, notes that “Trump is setting the scene to blame judges after an attack that has any conceivable connection to immigration.” He goes on: If Trump loses in court he credibly will say to the American people that he tried and failed to create tighter immigration controls. This will deflect blame for the attack. And it will also help Trump to enhance his power after the attack. After a bad terrorist attack at home, politicians are always under intense pressure to loosen legal constraints. (This was even true for near-misses, such as the failed Underwear bomber, which caused the Obama administration to loosen constraints on its counterterrorism policies in many ways.) Courts feel these pressures, and those pressures will be significantly heightened, and any countervailing tendency to guard against executive overreaction diminished, if courts are widely seen to be responsible for an actual terrorist attack. More broadly, the usual security panic after a bad attack will be enhanced quite a lot—in courts and in Congress—if before the attack legal and judicial constraints are seen to block safety. If Trump assumes that there will be a bad terrorist attack on his watch, blaming judges now will deflect blame and enhance his power more than usual after the next attack.5 One might add that Trump’s executive order and the presidential Twitter assault on the judiciary that followed have set up the judiciary to be blamed following any attack, not just one having “any conceivable connection to immigration.” In his followers’ view Trump has acted to protect the country and “political” judges have blocked him. He has put them in a position to take the fall. Perhaps this was not the original plan but with Trump, it is safe to say, there will likely never be an original plan that plays out to the end. As the hapless Jeb Bush observed, Trump was “a chaos candidate and he’d be a chaos president.” Better to say that Trump uses chaos as a vital element in his tactics, perhaps having learned during his long career to capitalize on the chaos that his recklessness, ignorance, and aggression inevitably create. ((ul))One might call the((/ul)) resulting ((ul))tactics “((/ul))((ul))shock and opportunity”: Trump uses chaos to shock his opponents into varying crouches of outrage and contempt and then lunges forward amid the tumult wherever he sees an opportunity((/ul))((ul)) presenting itself.((/ul)) No wonder he thinks of himself as the supreme “counter-puncher.” His virtuosity is in his opportunism. ((ul))It is against this reality that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))we must see ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))likelihood of a crisis as the ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))vital ((/ul))((ul))((hl))springboard of a Trump presidency, ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))especially an increasingly shaky, unpopular, and unstable one((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). ((/ul))((ul))((hl))The lower his poll numbers((/hl))((/ul)), the more outlandish his lies, the greater the resistance from opponents within the bureaucracies, the thicker his scandals and chaos, ((ul))((hl))the likelier he will be to seek to use a crisis((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) and all the opportunities it offers to lever himself from a position of defensiveness to that of dominating power((/ul)). It is impossible to say when ((ul))such a crisis might((/ul)) present itself or what it might ((ul))be((/ul)): A confrontation with Iran in the Persian Gulf? ((ul))((hl))A dust-up with China over its claimed possessions in the South China Sea((/hl))((/ul))((ul))?((/ul)) A terrorist attack on American soil? There is no way of predicting, but ((ul))it ((/ul))((ul))((hl))is worth taking very seriously((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) that some sort of crisis will come((/ul)) and that, given Trump’s past behavior, his ruthless opportunism, and his drumbeat emphasis on “protecting the country,” such a crisis might well serve as a turning point in a Trump presidency, particularly one that is increasingly under siege. Consider the possibility of a terrorist attack on American soil, even a failed one. Not only would such an attack, as noted, put Trump in a perfect position to strike out at the judiciary, a major countervailing institution, it would offer him the political leverage to put down various rebellions within the bureaucracy, particularly within the intelligence agencies. There is no way to know whether such an attack will come but one can say that Trump, by attempting to strike out at Muslims generally, as he had vowed to do, has managed to place the Islamic State in the tempting position of being able to affirm, by attacking the United States, that it is the avenger of all Muslims. No accident that its propagandists have been nothing short of exultant, dubbing Trump’s executive order “the blessed order” and thus raising it to the level of the United States’ “blessed invasion” of Iraq as a miracle savior of its cause. If, as the Islamic State has asserted, the goal of its attacks in the West has been to “eliminate the gray zone”—to place “Muslims in the West…between one of two choices,” to either “apostatize or [migrate] to the Islamic State, and thereby escape persecution from the Crusader government and citizens”6—then Trump’s immigration ban goes far toward accomplishing the same thing: isolating Islamic communities, placing them all among a besieged minority whose travel is restricted and whose loyalty to their adopted countries is put in question. Already several jihadist tweeters asserted that the prophecy of the late Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born cleric killed in a drone attack in Yemen in 2011, that the “West would eventually turn against its Muslim citizens,” had been fulfilled.7 If one sought to design a policy to encourage radicalization, it would be hard to suggest a better one. One needn’t posit an administration master plan to notice that a further attack, even an unsuccessful one, will find the political ground well prepared. The panic over security that follows will open the way to a variety of measures to “protect the country,” few or none of which might have been necessary to prevent the attack in the first place. As we have seen, after an attack politicians seize the opportunity to act, not least to deflect blame from themselves, and we can expect President Donald (“The hour of action has arrived!”) Trump, after his repeated vows to keep the country safe, to act aggressively and comprehensively. How far he might go would depend on the severity of an attack, the ambitions of the administration, and perhaps how cornered the president feels himself to be. What measures might we expect under a Trump state of emergency? Probably strong steps against refugees, aliens, and immigrants. Suspending all entry of refugees. Widespread deportations. Expelling many green card holders. Further tightening and even suspending immigration. Mosques might be placed under surveillance, the much-discussed Muslim registry established. More broadly, and again depending on the severity of an attack, bulk collection of metadata might be reinstituted along with other forms of domestic surveillance. Long-standing constraints on the military and the CIA operating domestically might be loosened or eliminated. Black sites would be reestablished and torture reintroduced. The cells at Guantánamo, nearly empty now, would once again begin to fill. The standing post–September 11 Authorization for the Use of Military Force might be expanded or replaced, allowing unlimited military strikes abroad—and, perhaps, at home. The latter might lead, in the case of a particularly severe attack, to the suspension of habeas corpus. Certainly if such an attack were to come during the current Congress there is no reason to expect anything other than majority cooperation and support, not only for Trump’s specific responses to the attack but for the rest of his program. Democrats, whom Trump would denounce as worse than judges in their obstructionism, would be on the defensive. And the courts, whose pushback in any case would take much longer—as it did after September 11—will have been politically hamstrung by a commander in chief who will be in a position to declare, and to repeat, that he had warned the “political judges” not to second-guess him in what was needed to protect the country but that they had not listened. He will not be shy in saying the same about the press, “the most dishonest human beings on earth.” By then his political drama will have been elevated from a battle against elites and the status quo to a heroic struggle for the survival of the nation. As the hero was fond of telling his crowds during the campaign: if he lost, “we won’t even have a country anymore.” There is little reason to suspect they don’t believe it still and no reason to think he does not. “Never let a crisis go to waste,” President Obama’s first chief of staff was fond of saying. It is fair to expect that, in the face of opportunities to increase his power, destroy the opposition, and build his “new political order,” President Trump will once again gaze upon the darkening skies and see only sunshine."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":83}},{"tag":"US-China nuclear war causes extinction","cite":"Wittner 12 [Lawrence, PhD, Professor of History emeritus at the State University of New York/Albany, has written extensively about nuclear war, “Is a Nuclear War With China Possible?”, first published on 11/30/11 and updated on 1/30/12, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lawrence-wittner/nuclear-war-china_b_1116556.html]","text":["But what would that “victory” entail?

But how do embattled leaders stand to gain from initiating such risky conflicts? Do diversionary incentives derive from an attempt to rally the people behind the regime, or from leaders taking risky gambles to demonstrate their competence to the population? The literature to date has specified several causal pathways through which domestic unrest pushes leaders to initiate conflict abroad. Yet these competing theories of what I call “diversionary incentives” remain largely untested. We remain unsure of whether diversionary conflict, to the extent it occurs at all, is driven by unpopular leaders attempting to prove their competence to coalition members, stir up nationalist sentiment at home, scapegoat foreign groups for domestic problems, or simply distract constituents from the government’s failings. Although scholars have posited numerous mechanisms potentially underlying diversion, recent work has largely centered on the “rally around the flag” and “gambling for resurrection” theories as the most plausible explanations of diversionary conflict. Rally around the flag theory derives from the social psychology literature and argues that the cohesion of an “in-group” increases during crises or conflicts against a widely recognized “out-group.” ((ul))The gambling for resurrection logic argues that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))embattled leaders can((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) rationally ((/ul))((ul))((hl))initiate risky conflicts((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) in a ((/ul))((ul))last ditch((/ul))((ul)) effort ((/ul))((ul))((hl))to((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))demonstrate competence((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) to the public((/ul)). ((ul))((hl))Recent studies((/hl))((/ul)) ((ul))have ((/ul))((ul))((hl))made significant advancements in specifying the((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))conditions under which diversion is likely to occur((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) and the types of conflicts likely to be initiated((/ul)) (Smith 1996; Gelpi 1997; Clark 2003; Mitchell and Prins 2004; Fordham 2005; Mitchell and Thyne 2010; Tir 2010). Little empirical work has been done, however, to adjudicate among the competing logics of how and why domestic unrest generates incentives for international conflict. This paper addresses this gap, assessing the various mechanisms thought to generate diversionary incentives for embattled leaders. I argue that we can gain significant leverage on the question of diversionary incentives by examining the types of states that are targeted in diversionary conflict. The rally and gambling theories posit entirely distinct logics behind the diversionary use of force, with immediate implications for the type of target chosen. Specifically, the rally theory predicts that diverting leaders will target traditional enemies and enduring rivals, as conflict against such persistent adversaries is most likely to promote in-group solidarity. ((ul))According to the gambling logic,((/ul)) conversely, ((ul))((hl))leaders((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) are essentially agents that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))must((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))demonstrate competence ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))to their poorly-informed principals((/hl))((/ul)), ((ul))the ((/ul))((ul))general public((/ul))((ul)) or winning coalition((/ul)) (Bueno de Mesquita and Siverson 1995; Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2003). ((ul))In order for((/ul))((ul)) an international conflict to demonstrate competence to these principals, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the target ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))must be((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) adequately ((/ul))((ul))((hl))powerful((/hl))((/ul)) (Tarar 2006). Defeating a weak adversary simply does not demonstrate a leader’s competence. Essentially, ((ul))the rally around the flag and gambling for resurrection theories yield starkly different hypotheses regarding the likely targets of diversionary conflict((/ul)). Testing these competing hypotheses can help us understand the nature of diversionary incentives and the domestic origins of international conflict. The extant literature has largely relied, implicitly or explicitly, on the rally around the flag logic in explaining diversionary conflict. A ((ul))systematic examination((/ul)) of diversionary targets, however, ((ul))indicates that the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))gambling for resurrection((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) logic ((/ul))((ul))((hl))may offer ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))a stronger explanation((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))of diversionary incentives.

Precisely because he was so ignorant of — and uninterested in — governance, the new president would delegate critical decisions to his team of decorated generals, veteran GOP operatives, and corporate titans.

According to a Washington Post account shortly after Nixon’s resignation, Schlesinger and the Joint Chiefs “kept a close watch to make certain that no orders were given to military units outside the normal chain of command.” The Post attributed the move to ((ul))((hl))concern((/hl))((/ul)) that ((ul))Nixon might((/ul)) try to ((ul))use the military to stage some sort of coup to avert impeachment((/ul)). But in its 2014 obituary of Schlesinger, the New York Times reported an even more chilling concern: that ((ul))in his disintegrating mental state((/ul)), ((ul))((hl))Nixon might((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))order the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))use((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) of ((/ul))((ul))((hl))nuclear weapons((/hl))((/ul)). If Schlesinger did indeed give this order—and over the remaining 40 years of his life, he artfully and consistently avoided denying it—it was unconstitutional. As Franklin C. Miller, who served for three decades in U.S. national security roles, told the New York Times in 2016, “((ul))The president and ((/ul))((ul))((hl))only the president has((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))authority to((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) order the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))use((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) of ((/ul))((ul))((hl))nuc((/hl))((/ul))((ul))lear weapon((/ul))((ul))((hl))s((/hl))((/ul)).” But ((ul))can the President alone order a first use of nuclear weapons, and((/ul)) for that matter, ((ul))a preventive war of choice?((/ul)) Since Donald Trump became a serious candidate for President, this legal, constitutional and moral conundrum and the memory of Schlesinger’s principled act of defiance have heavily shaped discussion of how he would handle the awesome powers of the presidency over national security. Donald ((ul))((hl))Trump’s presidency enters((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) its second year with the((/ul)) palpable ((ul))sense of ((/ul))((ul))((hl))a gathering storm((/hl))((/ul)). By most accounts, the investigation by special counsel Robert ((ul))((hl))Mueller is pushing((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) forward aggressively((/ul)) on multiple fronts. It may now be getting close to the President’s family and his most inner circle, after already indicting his former campaign chairman and obtaining plea agreements with his national security advisor and a lower-level foreign policy aide. Reportedly, Mueller is seeking to interview Trump directly. ((ul))In the courts of public opinion((/ul)) and elementary common sense (and possibly down the line, in legal proceedings as well), ((ul))the President appears to be his own worst enemy((/ul)). Who that is innocent of political collusion with the Russians repeats 16 times in an impromptu 30-minute interview, “there was no collusion”? The words have become such a relentless Trump mantra, day after day, week after week, like a nervous tick, that they inevitably summon Shakespeare’s trenchant insight from Hamlet, “The lady doth protest too much.” The persistent and by now gratuitous denials come from a President who is unable or unwilling to distinguish truth from fiction, who dishes out falsehoods as a daily ritual, whose gluttony and compulsive behavior suggest (in the words of a psychiatrist I respect) “a complete lack of impulse control,” and who, by the shocking account of Michael Wolff’s new book, Fire and Fury, as well as many others, doesn’t read memos, can hardly be briefed, is overwhelmed by an office he was not expecting to win, and is losing what grasp he had of reason and reality. In short, we may be approaching in the second year of the 45th president a situation as volatile and dangerous as the final days of the 37th president. For all his legendary faults—his greed for power, his paranoia, his bitterness and vindictiveness—((ul))((hl))Nixon((/hl))((/ul)) was ((ul))((hl))at least((/hl))((/ul)) a deeply experienced and knowledgeable president, both in domestic and foreign affairs, and he ((ul))((hl))understood the((/hl))((/ul)) awesome ((ul))destructive ((/ul))((ul))((hl))power of nuc((/hl))((/ul))((ul))lear weapon((/ul))((ul))((hl))s. Trump is((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) completely ((/ul))((ul))((hl))lacking((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) in governing or ((/ul))((ul))((hl))military experience((/hl))((/ul)) of any kind. Most frighteningly, ((ul))((hl))he may not((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) actually ((/ul))((ul))((hl))understand((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) how devastating a ((/ul))((ul))((hl))nuclear war((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) could be((/ul)), or even a conventional war on the Korean peninsula. And he may have learned the wrong lesson from his (to my view well justified) April 2017 launch of 59 cruise missiles to punish the Syrian regime for its use of chemical weapons. That brought no serious military retaliation against the United States. An attack on North Korea would involve very different stakes on both sides. ((ul))((hl))As 2018 unfolds((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))domestic and international dimensions of Trump’s((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) crisis-ridden ((/ul))((ul))((hl))presidency are beginning to intersect((/hl))((/ul)) in wildly unpredictable and potentially disastrous ways. There are signs of preparations for a U.S. military attack on North Korea by mid-year, and a new report by a leading Russian expert on North Korea indicates that the Pyongyang regime “is convinced that the U.S. is preparing to strike.” This would likely be not a full-scale military assault to terminate the North Korea’s tyrannical regime but rather a punishing “bloody nose” strike, either to send a message about American resolve to halt further testing and development of Kim Jong Un’s nuclear weapons program or to actually destroy as much of its existing infrastructure as possible. While every American would like to be rid of the nuclear threat from the world’s last totalitarian regime, the risks of a military strike are enormous. They involve not only the possibility of massive North Korean retaliation against South Korea (and against American military installations in South Korea and Japan, where a total of more than 50,000 American troops are based), but also a military confrontation with China, which is ramping up its own military preparations in response to the growing signs of the U.S. military planning for an assault. Moreover, the attack would likely be seen by most of the world as an unprovoked act of “preventive war,” and one that would be launched before diplomatic options had clearly been exhausted (as they have hardly yet been adequately pursued). This would leave the U.S. diplomatically isolated and viewed by most of the world as responsible for death and destruction on a massive level. A diplomatic breakthrough to freeze and contain North Korea’s program before it can hit the U.S. may still be possible, and Trump is now all of a sudden signaling openness to diplomacy. But it is hard to see this as anything more than the president’s notorious unpredictability. As the Wall Street Journal observed in reporting his new signal, “Mr. Trump has vacillated between seeming open to—and even eager for—diplomacy with North Korea, and dismissing the need or value for it.” Then there is the looming domestic political crisis. What signal was the President sending when he told the New York Times in December, “I have absolute right to do what I want to do with the Justice Department”? And what are we to make of the gathering drumbeat of demands from conservative media figures, Trump loyalists, and Republican congressmen for Mueller’s firing—a seemingly orchestrated campaign that has congressional Democrats and even some Republicans deeply worried? ((ul))In the coming months, the two gathering crises may((/ul)) well ((ul))intersect((/ul)). Given his past behavior and personal volatility, a Trump order to fire Mueller might be a shocking offense against the justice process, but it would hardly be surprising, considering his previous efforts to obstruct justice in the Russia investigation. These include his asking FBI director James Comey for a pledge of personal loyalty and then firing him when he did not receive it, and his attempt (in March of last year) to stop Attorney General Jeff Sessions from recusing himself from the Russia investigation. Then there was the widely reported incident aboard Air Force One last July 8, when the President reportedly personally dictated a statement his son was to issue insisting that Donald Trump Jr.’s meeting with a Russian lawyer the year before was “primarily” to discuss “a program about the adoption of Russian children,” and not the ongoing presidential campaign. Like the repeated condemnations of the special counsel’s investigations, the demands that it come to a close, and the endless recitation of the mantra, “there was no collusion,” these three episodes reek of the fear of a man who has something to hide, and who is laboring obsessively to hide it. ((ul))((hl))We do not yet have proof((/hl))((/ul)) either ((ul))of ((/ul))((ul))((hl))what happened with Russia((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), or of how((/ul)) Donald ((ul))Trump will conduct himself((/ul)) as this second year of his presidency unfolds.

At a press conference with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: \"The secretary general and I had a productive discussion about what more NATO can do in the fight against terrorism. I complained about that a long time ago and they made a change, and now they do fight terrorism. I said it was obsolete.

I like her, I respect her. It's very early.\" (On May 5, 2016: \"She is not a Republican. ...

((ul))It's certainly noteworthy that the president has undone so many positions in such a short time frame — Americans might reasonably want to know exactly what their leader believes. But what kind of ((/ul))((ul))((hl))political consequences((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) will he suffer? Potentially ((/ul))((ul))((hl))very few((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) — at least in the short term — ((/ul))((ul))((hl))according to ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))political experts((/hl))((/ul)). Here's why. ((ul))1) Lots of his ((/ul))((ul))((hl))supporters don't love him for specific policies, anyway((/hl))((/ul)). In 2004, one massive flip-flop was a crippling blow to John Kerry's campaign (See: his comments on how he \"actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it\"). Last year, however, ((ul))Trump ((/ul))((ul))((hl))made flip((/hl))((/ul))((ul))-flop ((/ul))((ul))((hl))after((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) flip-((/ul))((ul))((hl))flop during the((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) presidential ((/ul))((ul))((hl))campaign((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) — and he still won((/ul)). ((ul))Policy flip-flops simply didn't seem to stick to him((/ul)). One reason may be that ((ul))very specific policy proposals just aren't what people like about him((/ul)). \"I think there probably is something to the idea that to a degree ((ul))his appeal isn't policy-based,\" says Robert Van ((/ul))((ul))Houweling((/ul))((ul)), a political science professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who has studied flip-flopping((/ul)). \"One answer why ((ul))he has more latitude((/ul)) than some politicians is that ((ul))his appeal was more visceral((/ul)).\" Because of that, it's quite possible that ((ul))Trump's approval rating won't inch down much ((/ul))((ul))as a result of((/ul))((ul)) a half-dozen 180s((/ul)). \"I've just been out going to a bunch of town halls this week, and I ((ul))((hl))don't see any evidence that it's hurting him at all((/hl))((/ul))((ul)),\" says Mark McKinnon, a longtime strategist who served George W. Bush((/ul)), among others. \"And in fact, what I would say is for ((ul))((hl))opponents((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) of Trump, they're ((/ul))((ul))((hl))very happy to see him changing positions, and((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) his ((/ul))((ul))((hl))supporters don't((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) really ((/ul))((ul))((hl))care((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). It's remarkable((/ul)).\" Of course, it's true that there are a few key policies that Trump's voters did latch onto, like building a wall. But then, part of his \"visceral\" appeal came not just from the idea of building a wall (or proposing a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\" or imposing massive tariffs on China), but from his tough image in general. That toughness continues to win voters over. \"When people vote for presidents, it's more for attributes than it is for issues,\" McKinnon adds. \"And there's usually strength, trust, and you know, 'Does he reflect my values?' Those are the three big ones. And he's doing really well on strength right now\" because of his recent actions in Syria — which also, by the way, constitute a flip-flop. Indeed, Republicans now overwhelmingly support missile strikes in Syria — a reversal from 2013, during the Obama presidency, when two-thirds said they did not. ((ul))2) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))He ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))doesn't have much support to lose((/hl))((/ul)). Speaking of that ((ul))approval rating((/ul)), it's ((ul))already at near-historic-lows((/ul)) for a new president. ((ul))((hl))Those who approve((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) of him have ((/ul))((ul))((hl))already stuck with him through a litany of flip-flops((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Those who disapprove((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) — well, they ((/ul))((ul))((hl))already disapprove((/hl))((/ul)). With an approval rating of around 60 percent, a president likely has more people who aren't truly dedicated to them, Van Houweling says, \"so you quickly see the effect of sort of damaging political moves in that context.\" That kind of signal may not show up when you have been riding at around 40 to 45 percent for a while, he says. \"((ul))It's not easy to get a 10 percent decline in your popularity when you start out with really just your core supporters viewing your job being done well to begin with\" — particularly((/ul)), he adds, ((ul))if those supporters are already used to Trump's views on policy being easily changeable((/ul)). ((ul))3) Some of these policies aren't exactly emotional issues for Americans((/ul)). Trump just did do more major policy about-faces in a few days than other presidents might take years to do. But not all of these flip-flops are terribly meaningful to most Americans. Consider monetary policy. In 2015, 70 percent of Americans didn't know who Janet Yellen was. So suddenly saying he might reappoint her as Federal Reserve chair might reasonably not bother many Americans all that much. Likewise, Trump said over and over and over that he'd label China a \"currency manipulator.\" The average American has little reason to know exactly how currency manipulation works. One addendum here is that ((ul))while Trump's policy message((/ul)) on China ((ul))has changed, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))his ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))tone((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) hasn't budged((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) much((/ul)). He still proved on Twitter on Thursday morning that he's willing to talk tough on China: \"I have great confidence that China will properly deal with North Korea. If they are unable to do so, the U.S., with its allies, will!\" ((ul))Trump does have some particularly strong policy views, but no ((/ul))((ul))particular ideology((/ul))((ul)) is so central to his identity as that tough-guy image. It may be that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))maintaining that((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) image, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))as opposed to((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) maintaining ((/ul))((ul))((hl))particular policy((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) views((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), is what will ((/ul))((ul))((hl))allow him to remain constant((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) in voters' minds((/ul)). ((ul))4) Some flip-flops ((/ul))((ul))can be seen as((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))good flip-flops((/hl))((/ul)). ((ul))One upside((/ul)) to the Trump China flip-flop: ((ul))He flipped ((/ul))((ul))((hl))in the direction of truth((/hl))((/ul)). China really hasn't been manipulating its currency recently. (The Washington Post's Fact Checker in December called the currency manipulation claims \"way out of date.\") ((ul))To the extent that Trump's flip-flops reflect changing circumstances — or him acknowledging current circumstances —flip-flops could be viewed positively((/ul)). \"Conditions do change, and you have to change with them. I mean, that's part of the job,\" says Stephen Wayne, professor of government and an expert in the American presidency at Georgetown University. Indeed, presidents have ((ul))made flip-flops that were, in retrospect, smart moves((/ul)), as Slate's Jamelle Bouie has outlined.

Suggestion One: The president wins the war on crime! Solution: As president-elect, Trump is still saying the murder rate is \"highest in 45 years,\" a fictional claim he made in the campaign as well. Despite a jump in 2015, the murder rate is close to historical lows. So all he has to do is start using real statistics instead of phony ones to claim credit for solving this one. The formula can be repeated for other mistaken claims he made during the campaign about how terrible America is. Suggestion Two: Repeal a fictional law! Solution: The president can help fulfill his \"drain the swamp\" pledge if he can claim a full defeat for everyone in Congress, including the Republican leadership. A harmless way to do this is to make up a law he can persuade Congress to \"repeal.\" There's even a phony law that has already been invented, the Public Affairs Act of 1975, a title dreamed up by academics to study how public opinion works. It turns out that many people will readily express opinions on non-existent laws, and will support or oppose them in response to partisan cues. If congressional leaders deny the need to repeal the (fictional) law, perhaps Trump can get them to take action anyway, since it would placate the angry constituents who are calling the legislators' offices and demanding that the \"law\" be declared null and void. Done. Trump can go on a victory tour, and leave the battles over real policies to the people who are serious about the policies. Many voters don't know how law-making works in the U.S. in the first place, and others may not care much about the truth so much as they care about visibly sticking it to the do-nothing bureaucrats in Washington.

The only question is how much, and how successful presidents are in fighting back. Even the most knowledgeable presidents have very limited expertise, given the vast number of subjects they deal with -- everything from space travel to Medicare reimbursement rates to aircraft carriers to national parks to constitutional law to regulation of complex financial products to disputes among Kurdish factions in Iraq. And the civil servants and members of Congress and lobbyists that presidents deal with are often masters of detail on whatever specific issue is under consideration. Presidents win a lot of these fights (or at least play to a draw) because they have strong political skills. They are good at figuring out what others want, and at knowing the incentives and motivations of those they must interact with. ((ul))Trump((/ul)) has to date not demonstrated such skills, although, to be fair, ((ul))((hl))he's((/hl))((/ul)) only beginning to be tested. Thus far, he ((ul))has shown a weakness for being((/ul)) ((ul))((hl))easily distracted((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), and((/ul)) of ((ul))((hl))seeking quick((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), surface-level ((/ul))((ul))((hl))results((/hl))((/ul)) -- ((ul))ones((/ul)) that ((ul))career ((/ul))((ul))((hl))bureaucrats((/hl))((/ul)) or House subcommittee chairs ((ul))((hl))can ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))reverse((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))later((/ul)), once the president's attention has moved on to something else.

Of course, liberals believe that normal Republicans do plenty of damage to the nation on their own, Trump or no Trump.

For example, the Science of Military Strategy concludes that “((ul))in the present and ((/ul))((ul))long-term future((/ul)), ((ul))there is a ((/ul))((ul))miniscule((/ul)) (shenwei) ((ul))possibility((/ul)) ((ul))of an enemy initiating a large-scale ground invasion of China((/ul)).”125 Some Chinese ((ul))analysts((/ul)) also ((ul))note((/ul)) that U.S.-China ((ul))((hl))economic and political interdependence((/hl))((/ul)) would ((ul))((hl))further constrain((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) the role of ((/ul))((ul))((hl))nuclear weapons((/hl))((/ul)) ((ul))in any future U.S.-China contingency((/ul)).126 As a result, ((ul))the most likely((/ul)) U.S.-China ((ul))contingencies((/ul)) in which nuclear weapons could play a role ((ul))would involve Taiwan((/ul)) or U.S. allies. In these conflicts, Chinese analysts believe that the stakes would not warrant the use of nuclear weapons by China (unless attacked first). They implicitly assume that the stakes would be too low for the United States, as well, and that Washington would either restrain or abandon its allies if defending them gave rise to a situation in which the United States would need to threaten to use nuclear weapons.127 The general view was that the United States would not want to become entangled in a conflict with China on behalf of its allies or other states. One interlocutor suggested that Taiwan and North Korea were the only third-party contingencies over which the United States and China would be willing to risk a nuclear crisis. Nevertheless, this interlocutor maintained that ((ul))China would not use nuclear weapons against the Taiwanese people and that the Chinese government had distanced itself from((/ul)) the ((ul))remarks((/ul)) of a senior PLA officer who commented in 2005 ((ul))that China would use nuclear weapons if it were defeated in a conventional war over Taiwan((/ul)).128 Another interlocutor was concerned about the possible spillover effect of a U.S. preemptive strike on North Korea’s nuclear weapons. These Chinese views likely underestimate the strength of U.S. interests at stake in any conflict between a U.S. ally and China, as Christensen and Goldstein note. Although tensions have eased across the Taiwan Strait in recent years, the possibility of U.S. involvement in a conflict over Taiwan remains a real concern [End Page 35] for the PLA. The Science of Military Strategy acknowledges that cross-strait relations have improved, “but the key factors obstructing a solution to the Taiwan problem have not fundamentally disappeared.”129 As a result, the risk of a war over Taiwan’s unification is “relatively high.” The book states that such a war would be a relatively large-scale and relatively high-intensity conflict in which China would need to “guard against foreign military intervention” and that such a conflict would occur “against the background of nuclear deterrence.”130 ((ul))Nevertheless, for the second reason below, most((/ul)) interlocutors ((ul))did not believe that China would threaten or use nuclear weapons without being threatened or attacked first.((/ul)) ((ul))((hl))A second reason for((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) a relatively optimistic view of crisis ((/ul))((ul))((hl))stability is((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) the Chinese view ((/ul))((ul))((hl))that China’s limited ambiguity over its ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))n((/hl))((/ul))((ul))o-((/ul))((ul))((hl))f((/hl))((/ul))((ul))irst-((/ul))((ul))((hl))u((/hl))((/ul))((ul))se policy ((/ul))((ul))((hl))remains consistent((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) with a clear firebreak between the use of conventional and nuclear weapons((/ul)). China’s strategic community maintains that ((ul))((hl))China would not use((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) nuclear ((/ul))((ul))((hl))weapons first((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) in a crisis or conflict((/ul)). A recent textbook from AMS, for example, describes one of ((ul))the((/ul)) Second Artillery’s ((ul))main missions as “preventing((/ul)) (ezhi) ((ul))an enemy from escalating((/ul)) a conventional war to a nuclear war.”131 ((ul))In the context of a Taiwan contingency((/ul)), Maj.

Yao Yunzhu explains that “((ul))((hl))it would be ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))useless((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) for China ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))to deter U.S. conventional intervention((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) by using((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) China’s ((/ul))((ul))((hl))nuclear weapons((/hl))((/ul)). It is the United States, not China, which has the nuclear capabilities to control and even dominate conflict escalation.”132 Some Chinese interlocutors also claimed that U.S. conventional superiority contributes to a clear conventional-nuclear firebreak, as ((ul))((hl))the((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))U((/hl))((/ul))((ul))nited ((/ul))((ul))((hl))S((/hl))((/ul))((ul))tates ((/ul))((ul))((hl))would always have conventional options((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) to escalate a conflict ((/ul))((ul))((hl))and would((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) therefore ((/ul))((ul))((hl))not need to resort to nuclear threats or use((/hl))((/ul)).133 ((ul))Most((/ul)) interlocutors ((ul))expressed confidence that the((/ul)) ((ul))U((/ul))nited ((ul))S((/ul))tates ((ul))would have no reason to attack China’s nuclear arsenal((/ul)) with conventional weapons, but some interlocutors recognized that nuclear escalation control was a part of U.S. war planning, despite the United States’ conventional superiority.134 If China views a conventional attack on its nuclear weapons or infrastructure as a first strike that [End Page 36] would justify nuclear retaliation, its belief about a clear firebreak rests more on a belief that the United States will be deterred from initiating such an attack than it does on a principled constraint. ((ul))A third factor((/ul)) in China’s optimistic assessment of crisis stability ((ul))is((/ul)) the ((ul))perceived deterrent effectiveness of the limited ambiguity that China has allowed regarding its no-first-use policy((/ul)). Some strategists saw a greater temptation for the United States to attack China’s nuclear capabilities with conventional weapons as U.S. conventional precision strike capabilities improved. All inter-locutors indicated that China has carefully considered the possibility that the United States might use conventional force against China’s nuclear capabilities. As discussed earlier, ((ul))China’s response has been to allow ((/ul))((ul))((hl))limited ambiguity((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) over its no-first-use posture to ((/ul))((ul))((hl))deter such an attack((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) One interlocutor maintained that the United States did not believe that China would view an attack on China’s command and control facilities as an attack on its nuclear facilities and that China could do little to deter such an attack. Chinese strategists have noted that identifying what constitutes a nuclear command and control facility is challenging given the different levels of command and control.135 As a result, ((ul))China is allowing the ambiguity surrounding its no-first-use policy in the hope that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))this will ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))undermine U.S. confidence((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) that China would ((/ul))((ul))not escalate a conflict((/ul)) if its nuclear capabilities were targeted."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":92}},{"tag":"The aff is works within the academy, entrapped within the notion of “project” – it functions according to the will to productivity, that which subsumes resistance into the regularity of productive operations","cite":"Winters 17 (Joseph Winters is an assistant professor of Religious Studies with a secondary position in the Department of African and African American Studies at Duke University, “Baldwin, Bataille, and the Anguish of the (Racialized) Human,” Journal of Religious Ethics, ///ghs-sc)","text":["((ul))((hl))Bataille((/hl))((/ul)), more than Baldwin, ((ul))((hl))troubles the very logic of futurity.

Laughter is frequently a response to repugnance, or to the discomfort of others. As Bataille notes in the Preface to Madame Edwarda, 'laughter is the sign of aversion, of horror' (p. 224). But equally frequently, ((ul))((hl))laughter is a defense mechanism, warding off the horror:((/hl))((/ul)) 'it is indeed in laughter that we nd the justi cation for a form of castigation, of obloquy' (p. 224). It is quite possible that, in their subjective extremity and their intense seriousness about uncomfortable topics, Bataille's own texts may be subject to laughter, particularly to the derisory mirth of a comfort able Anglo-American pragmatic or utilitarian scepticism. But this would be to miss completely the imponance of Bataille's thought - and Bataille's laughter: What the heany laugh screens us from, what fetches up the bawdy jest, is the identity that exists between the utmost in pleasure and the utmost in pain: the identity between being and non-being, between the living and the death-stricken being, between the knowledge which brings one before this dazzling realization and de nitive, concluding darkness . . . ((ul))((hl))our laughter here is absolute, going far beyond sco ing ridicule of something which may perhaps be repugnant((/hl))((/ul)), but disgust for which digs deep under our skin . . . the sight of blood, the odour of vomit, which arouse in us the dread of death, sometimes introduce us into a nauseous state-which huns more cruelly than pain. (p. 225) That which is revolting, shocking, that which disarms predictable patte s of thinking and feeling, that which lies at the unhallowed extremes and unavowed interstices of social, philosophical or theoretical frameworks, are the objects of Bataille's fascination. Encounters with horror, violent disgust, that miraculously transform into experiences of laughter, intoxication, ec stasy, constitute, for Bataille, inner experiences that overwhelm any sense of the distinction between interiority or exteriority. ((ul))((hl))At the limit of knowledge, un-knowing is activated, a process in which subjectivity is torn apart, unworked at the core of physical and mental being. Bataille's writing((/hl))((/ul)) strains to evoke such experiences, pushing language to its very limits, ((ul))((hl))seeking the impossible in its re sal to remain contained within discourses predicated on sense, usefulness, responsibility, productiv((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))ity and positivity.((/hl))((/ul)) To feel violently ill at the encounter of such writing is perfectly natural in that the 'unnaturalness' of nature is disclosed as uncomfonable and horriing in its negativity: the homogeneous subject of culture retches in a movement of negation that never quite expends or transcends the force of heterogeneity in which she or he must imminently dissolve.

Of course, like the other times, I will fail. But first I would like to show you the extent of my failure.

I would have known how to make you perceive what is for me a decisive fact; the only object of my thought is play, and in play my thought, the work of my thought, is annihilated (USN 120).

We can already see that the features of the four elements of nonknowledge are significantly different from the presumptions made in the virtue epistemology conversation.

By the end of this document, however, I will argue that we can see these elements and features of nonknowledge at play in the virtue epistemology conversation, and that((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))nonknowledge can in fact be seen as a feature of knowledge-creation((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) of the kind we see in the virtue epistemology discussion, as an expression of classical epistemology, and of philosophy.

New possibilities of thought become available once that structure has been suspended and non-philosophy is an index of those philosophically un-envisageable possibilities (“Axiomatic Heresy: The non-philosophy of François Laruelle,” Radical Philosophy 121, p. 25). If nonknowledge were “a-knowledge” it would be the absence of knowledge. If it were “ir knowledge” or “un-knowledge,” it would be the negation of knowledge. Sticking with the Latin roots, nonknowledge is closer to “not-knowledge.” But this cannot mean that nonknowledge is strictly not-knowledge. The relationship of nonknowledge to knowledge can be explained with Bataille’s description of what makes excess possible: “[O]nly the impossibility of continuing growth makes way for squander. Hence the real excess does not begin until the growth of the individual or group has reached its limits” (Accursed Share 29). At full epistemic capacity, what could have been useful intellectual activity becomes excessive, wasteful intellectual activity. ((ul))((hl))Nonknowledge is((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) thus not ignorance or total absence of knowledge, but ((/ul))((ul))((hl))a challenging not-knowing that occurs at a limit((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))—at the((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) continuous and permanent ((/ul))((ul))((hl))threshold of—knowing((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). Because in the next chapter we will see that I am calling nonknowledge epistemic expenditure, I maintain that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))its most easily identifiable incarnations occur when a limit in thought((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), in thinking, in problem-solving—in ((/ul))88 “((ul))useful” mental activity—((/ul))((ul))((hl))is crossed((/hl))((/ul)). When thought has “exhausted its resources,” (Sasso ibid) pushed past a limit of usefulness. ((ul))((hl))Nonknowledge is((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) thus ((/ul))((ul))((hl))an alternate epistemology((/hl))((/ul)). Following the “non” of Laruelle, nonknowledge makes “new possibilities of thought” available (Brassier ibid). Bataille did not identify nonknowledge’s position as a threshold position, but he did lay the groundwork for my description. According to Bataille, nonknowledge occurs as a natural, necessary byproduct of the dissolution of knowledge (AC 74), which itself occurs at the height of knowledge, only when the “summit” of knowledge is reached (ibid). [K]nowledge leads to the limit, because knowledge as a willful comportment is motivated by a relation to the limit. Just as the interdit called for transgression, through an intimate accord hidden within its illusory opposition, knowledge calls to non-savoir as its violent complement, its hidden condition, its silent end. ‘The nonessence of the will to know arises’: it is not reason that motivates the desire to know—no more than it was reason that instituted the interdit. ((ul))((hl))The desire to know ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))is violent((/hl))((/ul))((ul))—is violence((/ul)) […] ((ul))((hl))It is((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) an exigency ((/ul))((ul))((hl))conditioned((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) by ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))survival and((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) by ((/ul))((ul))((hl))death((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). It leads((/ul)), through its privileged illusion of objectivity and the possession of truth, ((ul))inexorably to its limit. The experience of this limit is non-savoir((/ul))” (Joseph Libertson, “Bataille and Communication,” On Bataille 217). ((ul))Limits((/ul)) can be thresholds. Instead of being final, they ((ul))are thresholds—a permanent zone of openness to transformation((/ul)). ((ul))What we are capable of doing is not((/ul)) once and for all ((ul))determined((/ul)). We can experience a limit as a final limit—a necessary stopping-point—or ((ul))we can see if ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the limit is not((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) perhaps ((/ul))((ul))((hl))as final((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) or as real ((/ul))((ul))((hl))as it seems((/hl))((/ul)). ((ul))Understanding((/ul)) that ((ul))limits((/ul)) are thresholds is the key. This is a quasi-Deleuzian point. “Deleuze has an almost mathematical definition of the limit, ((ul))as that which one never really reaches((/ul)).56” (Rosi Braidotti, “The Ethics of Becoming Imperceptible,” Deleuze and Philosophy 10). Thus ((ul))((hl))understanding((/hl))((/ul)) the position of ((ul))((hl))nonknowledge((/hl))((/ul)) in relation to knowledge ((ul))((hl))is not a matter of((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) determining exactly ((/ul))((ul))((hl))where knowledge “ends” and nonknowledge “begins”; ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))it is a moment when we are faced with something unthinkable,((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))unknowable((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), un-communicable, or even heretical, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))and it is a matter of understanding that moment((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) not as a final marker of a limit, but ((/ul))((ul))((hl))as a threshold((/hl))((/ul)).

We’ve seen that this is perhaps uniquely possible in erotic experience, but it is not limited to thinking or knowing during, or about, erotic experience. Nonknowledge can occur when we are wondering about the structure of the universe. It can happen when a child asks us what time is. Certain events or experiences can occasion nonknowledge, but they are not the form of nonknowledge.

((/ul))((ul))((hl))This is an ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))affective meaning((/hl))((/ul)). Bataille happily concedes to Sartre that ((ul))(inner) experience is equivalent to “the pleasure of drinking a glass of spirits or feeling the sun’s warmth at the beach,” claiming that inner experience remaining/culminating in such frivolity only produces anguish((/ul)) (ON 173).

((ul))((hl))Bataille wanted inner experience to be ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))aimless but affectively productive((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) This is significant with regard to knowledge and nonknowledge: ((ul))Sartre is right in relation to me to recall the myth of Sisyphus((/ul)), though ‘in relation to me’ here equates to ‘in relation to humanity,’ I suppose. ((ul))What can be expected of us is to go as far as possible and not to stop((/ul)). What by contrast, humanly speaking, can be criticized are endeavors whose only meaning is some relation to moments of completion. ((ul))Is it possible for me to go further? I won’t wait to coordinate my efforts in that case—I’ll go further. I’ll take the risk.((/ul)) And readers, free not to venture after me, will often take advantage of that same freedom! ((ul))The critics are right to scent danger here! But let me in turn point out a greater danger((/ul)), one that comes from methods that, adequate only to an outcome of knowledge, ((ul))confer on individuals whom they limit a sheerly fragmentary existence—an existence that is mutilated with respect to the whole that remains inaccessible((/ul)) (ON 174-5). ((ul))((hl))If inner experience were not aimless((/hl))((/ul))((ul))—if it had a simple, definitive outcome—((/ul))((ul))((hl))the outcome would be knowledge((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). And experience is necessarily different from methods of contemplation and contestation which set out with knowledge as their outcome. Hence inner experience’s relation to nonknowledge: ((/ul))((ul))((hl))inner experience produces some absence of knowledge, and it does not seek knowledge((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) or anything in particular as a goal, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))paving the way for nonknowledge((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). Inner experience is also different from “methods” which require an individual to live a “fragmentary existence((/ul)),” separate and apart from some “whole” which remains inaccessible to them. This ((ul))separation from some whole is a greater danger than the danger of a task as Sisyphean as endless contestation.((/ul)) Bataille’s claim that ((ul))inner experience is not the kind of method which requires individuals to live fragmentedly,((/ul)) and separate, from some essential whole recalls his distinction between “continuity” and “discontinuity.” ((ul))Bataille is suggesting that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))inner experience allows him to live with access to a whole((/hl))((/ul))((ul))—as part of the whole—that would otherwise((/ul)) (with other methods) ((ul))remain inaccessible((/ul)). The method which ((ul))entails inaccessibility to the whole recalls discontinuity, and the method of being part of or caught up in the whole((/ul)) (inner experience) ((ul))recalls continuity((/ul)). It matters little what particular “method” or methods Bataille is using to describe inner experience. ((ul))What matters in identifying such methods is that they are ((/ul))((ul))((hl))methods that expect knowledge((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) as the outcome and that they achieve the outcome by ((/ul))((ul))((hl))limit((/hl))((/ul))((ul))ing ((/ul))((ul))((hl))individuals to ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))fragmentary existences((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) without access to the whole of which they are seeking part (in the form of “knowledge”). ((/ul))We will not see this concern for continuity in our virtue epistemology conversation, nor will we see knowledge characterized as fragmenting, or splintering. In Sensible Ecstasy, Amy Hollywood offers her analysis of Jean-Paul Sartre’s critique of Bataille in relation to Bataille’s desire for continuity over and above any desire for identifiable outcomes: “Sartre’s and Bataille’s opposing attitudes toward human projects are crucial here. Sartre insists that to be human is to engage in projects; ((ul))Bataille argues that inner experience is the opposite of project”((/ul)) (30). (And inner experience is especially not a project of self-improvement.) ((ul))Thus Bataille “generates endlessly recursive negations of his own attempt to provide a method for attaining inner experience((/ul))” (ibid). ((ul))According to Hollywood, this is ultimately the problem Sartre has with all of Inner ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Experience((/hl))((/ul))((ul)); that is, it has no method, it offers no clear goal, it ((/ul))((ul))((hl))is useless((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), it is not a ((/ul))project. “For Sartre, if inner experience does not give rise to new enterprises it is worth nothing more than ‘the pleasure of drinking a glass of alcohol or of warming oneself in the sun at the beach’ [ON 173]. Such experiences are, for Sartre, ‘useless’” (SE 31). Excesses are permissible for Sartre, Hollywood writes, as long as they are channeled fully into project—whether the project is political or personal. “Only if these excesses are contained by project can they be meaningful and useful” (SE 33). However, the intoxication that inner experience and its nonmeaning produce are all we need to reply to Sartre: ((ul))((hl))nonmeaning is not a total absence of meaning. Nonmeaning provides((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) some kind of ((/ul))((ul))((hl))meaning in the form((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) of intoxication, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))of ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))affect((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). We will see that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the same is true of nonknowledge((/hl))((/ul))((ul)): nonknowledge is not a total absence of knowledge, and its clearest meaning is an affective meaning. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Nonknowledge does not have a((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) particular kind of ((/ul))((ul))((hl))recuperable use((/hl))((/ul)). Inner Experience, Inner Experience, and Nonknowledge ((ul))Bataille closes his reply to Sartre with a description of inner experience itself: it is the movement of “willing a knowledge beyond practical ends((/ul))” (ON 176). Bataille acknowledges that ((ul))this willing “can’t be indefinitely continued((/ul))” (ibid). ((ul))((hl))Knowledge “beyond practical ends” is nonknowledge((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). Inner Experience((/ul)) (the text and the concept) ((ul))is thus a method and a non-method for arriving at nonknowledge((/ul)). If reading ((ul))Inner Experience((/ul)) moves one to pursue experience, it ((ul))opens up the possibility of arriving at nonknowledge((/ul)). The “((ul))method” inspires anguish because it produces only knowledge beyond practical ends—useless pseudo-knowledge((/ul)). The ((ul))method looks, sounds, and seems like mystical ecstasy from the outside, but, according to Bataille, it can be and is understood differently from the “inside((/ul))55.” The method of ((ul))((hl))inner experience((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) is not just an avenue to nonknowledge; it ((/ul))((ul))((hl))is((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) partially ((/ul))((ul))((hl))constitutive of nonknowledge.

For Trungpa, the sun is a symbol of basic goodness, and the human capacity to awaken to it, to become enlightened. For Bataille, the sun is the material starting point for earthly life, and thus his phi- losophy. ((ul))“((/ul))((ul))((hl))Solar energy((/hl))((/ul))((ul)),” writes Bataille, “((/ul))((ul))((hl))is the source of life’s exuberant development((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). The origin and essence of our wealth are given in the radiation of the sun, which dispenses energy—wealth—without any return.”65 The sun offers our planet enough energy in one hour to meet contemporary civilizational needs for an entire year((/ul)).66 Harnessing this energy, to be sure, is a massive technological challenge. Moreover, biological life only has limited access to the superabundance of solar energy that hits the planet every day. But the amount of energy we can access enables an energetically rich life. ((ul))Bataille’s materialist analysis of solar lavishness helpfully concretizes Trungpa’s account of basic goodness, what he also referred to as “basic richness.”((/ul))67 While Trungpa o ers practices for people to feel their inherent goodness and richness, actually experiencing this goodness takes time.68 Without spending hours meditating, and slowly uncovering a tender and radiating heart, Trungpa’s teachings on basic goodness and richness can appear ideal- istic. ((ul))Bataille’s materialist account of solar generosity further evidences Trungpa’s philosophy; it offers strong conceptual proof that can heighten commitment to the experiential practice of meditation. “ ((/ul))((ul))((hl))The sun gives without ever receiving((/hl))((/ul))((ul)),” argues Bataille. ((/ul))“[Humans] were conscious of this long before astrophysics measured that ceaseless prodigality; they saw it ripen the harvests and they associated its splen- dor with the act of someone who gives without receiving.”69At a basic biological level, the sun’s exuberance means that “on the surface of the globe, for living matter in general, energy is always in excess, the ques- tion is always posed in terms of extravagance.”70 Put more succinctly: “((ul))((hl))We receive more energy than we can use((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).”((/ul))71 e basic planetary con- dition is wealth more than poverty. ((ul))The essential meaning of Bataille’s claim that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))luxury((/hl))((/ul))((ul))—not necessity—((/ul))((ul))((hl))organizes life on earth((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) is that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))all organisms have access to more energy than required((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) for subsistence, thanks to the sun’s exuberance((/ul))((ul)), is ((/ul))((ul))((hl))excess is often invested in biological growth((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) (at the level of an organism, species, or ecosystem).

((/ul))((ul))((hl))All organisms and systems are left with a surplus to spend((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) “willingly or not, gloriously or catastrophically.”((/ul))72 Evidence of earthly richness includes the ornate colors and plumage of the animal kingdom that seemingly exceed evolutionary use-value. Similarly, consider the capacity for pleasure su using animal life, espe- cially all the sexualized pleasures apparently unrelated to procreation. Even when a sensory pleasure is associated with basic functioning like a good sneeze, excretion, or stretch, there can still be sumptuousness to the sensation (need it feel so good?). A sneeze is arguably basic good- ness at work, a ash of solar exuberance amidst our everyday lives. Consider, also, the ubiquity of queerness across the animal king- dom. According to Bruce Bagemihl, author of Biological Exuberance (a book that draws heavily from Bataille), “homosexuality is found in virtually all animal groups, in virtually all geographic areas and time periods, and in a wide variety of forms.”73 But why, asks Bagemihl, “does same-sex activity persist—reappearing in species after species, generation after generation, individual after individual—when it is not useful” from a strictly evolutionary perspective?74 Bagemihl’s answer is that use and necessity are not life’s sole organizing principles: “Natural systems are driven as much by abundance and excess as they are by limitation and practicality. Seen in this light, homosexuality and non- reproductive heterosexuality are ‘expected’ occurrences—they are one manifestation of an overall ‘extravagance’ of biological systems that has many expressions.”75 ((ul))For Bataille, our primordial condition is marked by richness thanks to the lavishness of the sun. And then, of course, we die. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Death can easily appear as proof of our ultimate poverty((/hl))((/ul))((ul)); it seemingly mocks attempts to assert the basic richness or goodness of life.

We lie to ourselves when we dream of escaping the movement of luxurious exuberance of which we are only the most intense form.”76 ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Death’s energetic squandering is((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) also ((/ul))((ul))((hl))an ecological gift((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) for((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))new life((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) arising from decay: ((/ul))((ul))((hl))“[Humankind] conspires to ignore the fact that ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))death is also the youth of things((/hl))((/ul)).”77 Bataille’s reading of death as exemplary of basic goodness supports Trungpa’s encouragement to ((ul))“((/ul))((ul))((hl))make friends with our death((/hl))((/ul))((ul)),” and to not resentfully cast it as “a defeat and as an insult.”78 Tibetan culture, according to Bataille, is more successful than Euro-American ones at affirming the totality of life.((/ul)) For Bataille, cultur- al forms that communicate this a rmation are glorious expenditures of basic energetic wealth. e resentment that animates so many Eu- ro-American cultural forms is itself enabled by energetic exuberance, a “catastrophic” use of our basic richness.79 And the Euro-American desire to escape our corporeality only intensi es feelings of lack and malaise by disconnecting us from the earthly exuberance alive in our changeful bodies. For Bataille: ((ul))Anguish arises when the anxious individual is not himself stretched tight by the feeling of superabundance((/ul)). is is precisely what evinces the isolated, individual character of anguish. ere can be anguish only from a personal, par- ticular point of view that is radically opposed to the general point of view based on the exuberance of living matter as a whole. Anguish is meaningless for someone who over ows with life, and for life as a whole, which is an over owing by its very nature.80 Energetic poverty and lack are realities for life on earth. But they are always felt by particular beings at particular times; energetic lack is not our general or basic condition. And yet the more we separate ourselves from exuberant life energies in attempts to gain dominion over them, the more liable we are to experience lack; we progressively remove our- selves from nature’s over ow. Bataille was interested in nurturing a sovereign—rather than ser- vile—human encounter with existence: “ e sovereignty I speak of has little to do with the sovereignty of states... I speak in general of an aspect that is opposed to the servile and the subordinate.”81 Viewing humans as agents of life’s exuberance, Bataille saw sovereignty as hu- manity’s “primordial condition.”82 ((ul))We are regal and rich from birth.

Bataille's notion of ((ul))death is((/ul)) an empty version of Hegel's: it is ((ul))negativity, but one that cannot be recuperated((/ul)), even if all our actions can be seen as attempts at such a recuperation. ((ul))Death is the loss that defines our existence as individuals, since sexual reproduction is absolutely caught up with the death of the individual((/ul)); unlike amoebae, there is no continuity of Being from one organism to the next (The Accursed Share, 32; OC VII, 39. See also Eroticism, 12-15; OCX, 17-21). Death, then, is as much part of the inherent wastefulness in nature as life. ((ul))((hl))Death seems((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) to us like ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the most wasteful form((/hl))((/ul)), but for Bataille, such a conception is to be left behind (not ignored or overcome): 'the luxury of death is regarded by us in the same way as that of sexuality, first as a negation of ourselves, then - in a sudden reversal - as the profound truth of that movement of which life is the manifestation (The Accursed Share, 34-5; OC VII, 41). Is death then in some way the truth of Bataille's system? At points it recalls Heidegger's notion of 'Being toward death', but as with many of Bataille's notions, the whole issue of centrality is open to question even as it is posed. Bataille argues that it will always be possible to show that whichever primordial fact gets priority presuppose s the existence of anothe r one (The Accursed Share, vol. II, 82; OC VIII, 71). 1 Death features in early writings - 'beings only die to be born', 'Solar Anus', 7; OC I, 84), and become s something that does not transcend the individual so much as lose the individual in a generalized excess. Instead of Hegel's mastery of death, ((ul))we see that in the fact that life and death are passionately devoted to the subsidence of the void, the relation of master/slave subordination is no longer revealed, but life and void are confused and mingled like lovers, in the convulsive moments of the end. ((/ul))('Sacrifices', 133; OC I, 93 trans, mod.) ((ul))Instead of giving in to death, accepting it at a distance, as the distancing that structure s Being (Heidegger), ((/ul))((ul))((hl))death is to be embraced((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), as 'it appears that no less a loss than ((/ul))((ul))((hl))death is needed for the brilliance of life((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) to traverse and transfigure dull existence((/ul)) (Th e Practice of Joy Before Death', 239; OC I, 557). This is not because death is so marvellous, but because it is everywhere, linking the individual to everything else (what Bataille will go on to call the general economy): I can only perceive a succession of cruel splendours whose very movement requires that I die: this death is only the exploding consumption of all that was, the joy of existence of all that comes into the world; even my own life demands that everything that exists, everywhere, ceaselessly give itself and be annihilated. (The Practice of Joy Before Death', 239; OCI, 557) Bataille is not arguing from the perspective whereby the universe only exists in one's own mind, but that even we, pathetic individuals that we are, feature in the ceaseless process of death and destruction. This linkage of the individual, throug h death, to others, to the general economy, is what is pursued in Bataille's connecting of the erotic with death, which is a development of the linkage between sex and death. In Eroticism he uses the term 'continuity to designate both the state of shared existence of asexual reproduction and what lies beyond individuality when individuals lose themselves in sacrifice, erotic activity, laughter, drunkenness and so on (Eroticism, 11-25; OCX, 17-30). These attempts interest him because 'eroticism opens the way to death. Death opens the way to the denial of our individual selves (24; 29). Death 57 The second volume of The Accursed Share, subtitled The History of Eroticism, is often seen as being little more than a draft version of Eroticism, but there are crucial differences in emphasis. The History of Eroticism really is a genuine part of the work on 'the accursed share', whereas such an economy is only implicit in Eroticism. More importantly still, the former seeks to link sexuality to death, and the latter attempts the opposite movement (both movements, for no clear theoretically necessary reason, lead Bataille to associate Woman with death). The second volume of The Accursed Share even starts by stating that it is not really about eroticism, but is instead 'a thinking that does not fall apart in the face of horror', emerging from 'a system of thought exhausting the totality of the possible (The Accursed Share, vol. II, 14; OC VIII, 10). In writing about death as part of the general economy, it also emerges that death is not necessarily literal death. But we should on no account take it as simply a metaphor, as metaphors imply a reality to be represented, and Bataille offers no such real world, existing to be represented in mimesis, metaphor or metonymy. ((ul))Death and Fear ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Hegel sees death as the origin of((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) humanity's ((/ul))((ul))((hl))self-consciousness((/hl))((/ul)) (this being, initially, consciousness of death), ((ul))and the rest of time consists of the struggle to master death.((/ul)) Communal existence is also centred around death, and the two combine in the form of architecture. According to Hollier, for Hegel, ((ul))'architecture is something appearing in the place of death, to point out its presence and to cover it up: the victory of death and the victory over death'((/ul)) (Against Architecture, 6). For Bataille, however, this is precisely the problem: our society is this fearful covering up of death (whereas the Aztecs, for example, exposed death in the sacrifice - at the top of, rather than inside, the pyramid). 2 In The Accursed Share, vol. II, he argues that ((ul))all ((/ul))((ul))((hl))society((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), all individual existence ((/ul))(as opposed to the restricted economy of modern individualism) ((ul))((hl))emerges from this fear of death((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) - and this fear is at its most creative when it approaches death. ((/ul))58 Georges Bataille At the same time as ((ul))humanity is drawn toward death,((/ul)) it pushes it away - ((ul))this repulsion is what defines humanity. ((/ul))Repulsion is the key word, as ((ul))death is not simply a negativity, something that happens to the subject, but something that, even when it happens to someone else, provokes disgust. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Humanity is defined by its 'repugnance for death((/hl))((/ul))/ (The Accursed Share, vol. II, 61; OC VIII, 51). This is hardly a novel or shocking statement, but ((ul))death is specifically part of what repels us because we repel it, and arguably the (primordial) object of disgust (and only in becoming human does death constitute something disgusting). ((/ul))Humans have a horror of all that threatens their unitary existence: excretions, filth, loss of control through drunkenness, eroticism (61-2; 51-2). More than this, we also have a horror of life, as at some level we are aware of life as a by-product of death, so much so that 'we might think, if need be, that living((ul)) ((/ul))matter on the very level we separate ourselves from it is the privileged object of our disgust (63; 52). All such disgusts are caught up within taboos, in a relation where it is impossible to ascertain whether the taboo created the disgust, or responds to it. For Bataille, however, death really is at the heart of the existence of taboo, but is not the exclusive centre: since it goes without saying, I will not linger over the possible anteriority of the horror of death. This horror is perhaps at the root of our repugnance (the loathing of nothingness would then be at the origin of the loathing of decay, which is not physical since it is not shared by animals) . It is clear, in any event, that the nature of excrement is analogous to that of corpses and that the places of its emission are close to the sexual parts; more often than not, this complex of prohibitions appears inextricable. (79; 68) This complex marks the line of demarcation between human and other and proximity to these phenomena constitutes the crossing of this line. This crossing and the fear of crossing gives the 'universally human character of the problem of obscenity (54; 45), even if contra Freud and Levi-Strauss, for example, there is no particular taboo that is universal.3 ((ul))((hl))Death((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) is also 'at the beginning insofar as its appearance ((/ul))((ul))((hl))coincides with labour and utility - this is what makes death a problem((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) for the individual, as ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the individual conceives of his or her self as something to be maintained((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), preserved and developed((/ul)) (82; 70) .((ul))((hl))Death((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) very rapidly ((/ul))((ul))((hl))becomes the site of prohibition((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), and takes two principal forms: both murder and 'contact with corpses are forbidden((/ul)) (79; 68). It is not the metaphysical difficulty of impending death that creates this fear, since this arises from an awareness that life is an accident between waste and decay, with only waste and decay in between. As Bataille notes, life is a luxury of which death is the highest degree (85-6; 74) and 'moreover, life is a product of putrefaction (80; 69), so ((ul))death and decay are linked to conceptions of our birth and origin ((/ul))(for him, this accounts for 'our fear of menstrual blood, for example). Here, as elsewhere, it is striking how far Bataille goes down a road attacking preconceptions only to launch into a restatement of tired cliches about 'woman as other, as death. He simply does not question the taboos around 'woman', and this is why Kristeva's gloss on Bataille (Powers of Horror) and Mary Douglas's Purity and Danger is so successful - it completes the logic already under way. The all-pervasive absence, or denial, of death, through prohibition, is why death is to be approached, and also why we have an attraction to as well as repulsion from death and all that threatens our identity, so that for example, 'eroticism, it may be said, is assenting to life up to the point of death (Eroticism, 11; OCX, 17). Death and eroticism remain charged with danger, and create anguish in individuals as their individuality falls away (The Accursed Share, vol. II, 101; OC VIII, 88) . 5 But as with Hegel's 'facing up to death', Bataille does not limit the notion of death to actual biological death - it comes to include all that undoes the individual, such that the introduction, or irruption, of death into life makes life become exuberant (99; 86). Erotic activity, for example, must be carried out intensely (otherwise it is just sex), for 'if the sensations do not have their greatest intensity, it is possible for us to isolate objects on the field of the totality (118-19; 102). By totality, ((ul))Bataille does not mean the kinds of ideology that account for everything, but the amorphous sphere beyond subjects, and beyond a simple subject/object divide. Even if death is not real, there is no reduction of the experience of approaching death((/ul)) (we can never attain death - in this Bataille is with Heidegger). If ((ul))((hl))we are instructed that to 'live life to the full we must 'embrace death'((/hl))((/ul)), what do we gain? Nothing much, except the awareness of an impossibility (we do not even gain nothing, as asceticism would aspire to), but what will have happened is the following: the embrace restores us, not to nature (which is itself, if it is not reintegrated, only a detached part), but rather to the totality in which man has his share by losing himself. For an embrace is not just a fall into the animal muck, but the anticipation of death, and the putrefaction that follows it. (119; 103) There is no why, however, and there can only be Virtuar replies to 'why? - i.e. ((ul))((hl))there can be the project of approaching death((/hl))((/ul)), as it enhances subjectivity, ((ul))but ((/ul))((ul))((hl))this project is lost at the moment it is attained,((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) whether in actual death or in death-like experience (nonexperience).((/ul)) Note also that the only 'return is to something that is necessarily lost, again and again. Eroticism, then, is one direction waste or excess can take that involves death (itself waste, excess), but ((ul))Bataille also hints at another level at which death can be approached - a level that really is metaphorical.((/ul))"],"stats":{"highlightedWords":126}},{"tag":"They ignore that death is the youth of things – the impacts the aff has identified are nothing but a balancing of the disequilibrium of life.

The unity of pleaning of these taboos should finally be clear from studies of their various aspects. We come up against one difficulty at the start: the taboos I regard as fundamental affect two radically different fields. Death and reproduction are as diametrically opposed as negation and affirmation. Death is really the opposite process to the process ending in birth, yet these opposite processes can be reconciled. The death of the one being is correlated with the birth of the other, heralding it and making it possible. ((ul))((hl))Life is((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) always ((/ul))((ul))((hl))a product of the decomposition of life((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).

It condemns it and shuts it out. ((/ul))This reaction is strongest in man, and horror at death is linked not only with ((ul))the annihilation of the individual but also with the decay that sends the dead flesh back into the general ferment of life.((/ul)) Indeed the deep respect for the solemn image of death found in idealistic civilisation alone comes out in radical opposition. Spontaneous physical revulsion keeps alive in some indirect fashion at least the consciousness that the terrifying face of death, its stinking putrefaction, are to be identified with the sickening primary condition of life. For primitive people the moment of greatest anguish is the phase of decomposition; when the bones are bare and white they are not intolerable as the putrefying flesh is, food for worms. In some obscure way the survivors perceive in the horror aroused by corruption a rancour and a hatred projected towards them by the dead man which it is the function of the rites of mourning to appease. But afterwards they feel that the whitening bones bear witness to that appeasement. The bones are objects of reverence to them and draw the first veil of decency and solemnity over death and make it bearable; it is painful still but free of the virulent activity of corruption. These white bones do not leave the survivors a prey to the slimy menace of disgust. They put an end to the close connections between decomposition, the source of an abundant surge of life, and death. But in an age more in touch with the earliest human reactions than ours, this connection appeared so necessary that even Aristotle said that certain ((ul))((hl))creatures((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), brought into being spontaneously,((/ul)) as he thought, in earth or water, ((ul))((hl))were born of corruption((/hl))((/ul))) The generative power of corruption is a naive belief responding to the mingled horror and fascination aroused in us by decay. This belief is behind a belief we once held about nature as something wicked and shameful: ((ul))((hl))decay summed up the world we spring from and return to((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), and horror and shame were attached both to our birth and to our death.((/ul)) That nauseous, rank and heaving matter, frightful to look upon, a ferment of life, teeming with worms, grubs and eggs, I That is how Aristotle thought of \"spontaneous generation\", which he believed to take place. is at the bottom of the decisive reactions we call nausea, disgust or repugnance. ((ul))Beyond the annihilation to come which will fall with all its weight on the being I now am, which still waits to be called into existence, which can even be said to be about to exist rather than to exist (as if I did not exist here and now but in the future in store for me, though that is not what I am now) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))death will proclaim my return to seething life((/hl))((/ul)). Hence ((ul))((hl))I can anticipate and live in expectation of that multiple putrescence that anticipates its sickening triumph in my person.((/hl))((/ul)) Nausea and its general field ((ul))When somebody dies we, the survivors, expecting the life of that man now motionless beside us to go on, find that our expectation has suddenly come to nothing at all.((/ul)) A dead body cannot be called nothing at all, but that object, that corpse, is stamped straight off with the sign \"nothing at all\". ((ul))For us survivors, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the corpse((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) and its threat of imminent decay ((/ul))((ul))((hl))is no answer to any expectation((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) like the one we nourished while that now prostrate man was still alive; it is the answer to a fear.((/ul)) ((ul))((hl))This object((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), then, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))is ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))less than nothing((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) and worse than nothing. It is entirely in keeping that fear, the basis of disgust, is not stimulated by a real danger. The threat in question cannot be justified objectively.((/ul)) There is no reason to look at a man's corpse otherwise than at an animal's, at game that has been killed, for instance. The terrified recoiling at the sight of advanced decay is not of itself inevitable. Along with this sort of reaction we have a whole range of artificial behaviour. The horror we feel at the thought of a corpse is akin to the feeling we have at human excreta. What makes this association more compelling is our similar disgust at aspects of sensuality we call obscene. The sexual channels are also the bod y' s sewers; we think of them as shameful and connect the anal orifice with them. St. Augustine was at pains to insist on the obscenity of the organs and function of reproduction. \"Inter faeces et urinam nascimur\", he said-\"we are born between faeces and urine\". Our faecal products are not subject to a taboo formulated by meticulous social regulations like those relating to dead bodies or· to menstruation. But generally speaking, and though the relationship defies clear definition, there do exist unmistakable links between excreta, decay and sexuality. It may look as though physical circumstances imposed from without are chiefly operative in marking out this area of sensibility. But it also has its subjective aspect. The feeling of nausea varies with the individual and its material source is now one thing and now, another. After the living man the dead body is nothing at all; similarly nothing tangible or objective brings ·on our feeling of nausea; what we experience is a kind of void, a sinking sensation. We cannot easily discuss these things which in themselves are nothing at all. Yet they do make their presence felt and often they force themselves on the senses in a way that inert objects perceived objectively do not. How could' anyone assert that that stinking mass is nothing at all? But our protest, if we make one, implies our humiliation and our refusal to see. We imagine that it is the stink of excrement that makes us feel sick. But would it stink if we had not thought it was disgusting in the first place ? We do not take long to forget what trouble we go to to pass on to our children the aversions that make us what we are, which make us human beings to begin with. Our children do not spontaneously have our reactions. They may not like a certain food and they may refuse it. But we have to teach them by .pantomime or failing that, by violence, that curious aberration called disgust, powerful enough to make us feel faint, a contagion passed down to us from the earliest men through countless generatipns of scolded children. Our mistake is to take these teachings lightly. For thousands of years we have been h~ding them down to our children, but they used to have a different form. The realm of disgust and nausea is broadly the result of these teachings. The prodigality of life and our fear of it After reading this ((ul))((hl))we((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) may ((/ul))((ul))((hl))feel a void opening((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) within us. ((/ul))What I have been saying refers to this void and nothing else. But ((ul))((hl))the ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))void opens at a specific point. Death((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), for instance, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))may open it((/hl))((/ul))((ul)): the corpse into which death infuses absence, the putrefaction associated with this absence((/ul)). I can link ((ul))my revulsion at the decay((/ul)) (my imagination suggests it, not my memory, so profoundly is it a forbidden object for me) ((ul))with the feelings that obscenity arouse in me. I can tell myself that repugnance and horror are the mainsprings of my desire, that such desire is only aroused as long as its object causes a chasm no less deep than death to yawn within me, and that this desire originates in its opposite, horror. From the outset reflections like these go beyond all reasonableness. It takes an iron nerve to perceive the connection between the promise of life implicit in eroticism and the sensuous aspect of death((/ul)). ((ul))Mankind ((/ul))((ul))conspires to ignore the fact that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))death is((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) also ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the youth of thing((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))s.((/hl))((/ul)) ((ul))Blindfolded, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))we refuse to see that only death guarantees the fresh upsurging without which life would be blind. We refuse to see((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) that life is the trap set for the balanced order, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))that life is nothing but instability and disequilibrium. Life is a swelling tumult continuously on the verge of explosion((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). But ((/ul))((ul))((hl))since the incessant explosion constantly exhausts its resources, it can only proceed under one condition: that beings given life whose explosive force is exhausted shall make room for fresh beings coming into the cycle((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) with renewed vigour.'((/ul)) I Although this truth is generally ignored, Bossuet expounds it in his Sermon on Death (1662). \"((ul))Nature((/ul))\" he says \"((ul))as if jealous of her gifts to us, often declares and makes plain the fact that she cannot leave: us for long in possession of the little substance she lends us, which must not remain always in the same hands but must be kept eternally in circulation. ((/ul))She needs it for other forms, she asks for it to be returned for other works. Those continual additions to humankind, the children being born, seem to nudge us aside as they come forward, saying 'Back now; it is our tum'. So as we see others pass ahead of us, others will see us pass, and themselves present the same spectacle to their successors\". A more extravagant procedure cannot be imagined. In one way life is possible, it could easily be maintained, without this colossal waste, this squandering annihilation at which imagination boggles. Compared with that of the infusoria, ((ul))((hl))the mammalian organism is a gulf that swallows vast quantities of energy((/hl))((/ul)). This energy is not entirely wasted if it allows other developments to take place. But we must consider the devilish cycle from start to finish((ul)). The growth of vegetable life implies the continuous piling up of dissociated substances corrupted by death. Herbivorous creatures swallow vegetable matter by the heap before they themselves are eaten, victims of the carnivore's urge to ((/ul))devour. Finally nothing is left but this fierce beast of prey or his remains, in their tum the prey of hyenas and worms. There is one way of considering this process in harmony with its nature: the more extravagant are the means of engendering life, the more costly is the production of new organisms, the more successful the operation is! The wish to produce at cut prices is niggardly and human. Humanity keeps to the narrow capitalist principle, that of the company director, that of the private individual who sells in order to rake in the accumulated credits in the long run (for raked in somehow they always are). ((ul))On a comprehensive view, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))human life strives towards prodigality((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) to the point of anguish, to the point where the anguish becomes unbearable. The rest is mere moralising chatter. How can this escape us if we look at it dispassionately? Everything proclaims it! ((/ul))((ul))((hl))A febrile unrest within us asks death to wreak its havoc at our expense.((/hl))((/ul)) We go half way to meet these manifold trials, these false starts, this squandering of living strength in the transition from ageing beings to other younger ones. ((ul))At bottom we actually want the impossible situation it all leads to: the isolation, the threat of pain, the horror of annihilation;((/ul)) but for the sensation of nausea bound up with it, so horrible that often in silent panic we regard the whole thing as impossible, we should not be satisfied. ((ul))But our judgments are formed under the influence of recurring disappointments and the obstinate expectation of a calm which goes hand in hand with that desire; our capacity to make ourselves understood is in direct ratio with the blindness we cling to((/ul)). For at the crest of the convulsion, which gives us shape ((ul))((hl))the naive stubbornness that hopes that it will cease can only increase the torment, and this allows life((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), wholly committed to this gratuitous pattern, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))to add the luxury of a beloved torment to fatality((/hl))((/ul)). For if ((ul))man is condemned to be a luxury in himself, what is one to say of the luxury that is anguish?((/ul)) Man's \"no\" to Nature When all is said and done ((ul))human reactions((/ul)) are what ((ul))speed up the process; anguish speeds it up and makes it more keenly felt at the same time.((/ul)) In general man's attitude is one of refusal. ((ul))((hl))Man has leant over backwards((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) in order not to be carried away by the process, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))but all he manages to do((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) by this ((/ul))((ul))((hl))is to hurry it along((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) at an even dizzier speed((/ul)). If we ((ul))view the primary taboos as the refusal laid down by the individual to co-operate with nature regarded as a squandering of living energy and an orgy of annihilation ((/ul))we can no longer differentiate between death and sexuality. ((ul))((hl))Sexuality and death are simply the culminating points of the holiday((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), nature celebrates, with the inexhaustible multitude of living beings, both of them ((/ul))((ul))((hl))signifying the boundless wastage of nature's resources((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) as opposed to the urge to live on characteristic of every living creature((/ul)). In the long or short run, reproduction demands the death of the parents who produced their young only to give fuller rein to the forces of annihilation (just as ((ul))((hl))the deat((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))h of a generation demands that ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))a new generation be born((/hl))((/ul))). In the parallels perceived by the human mind between putrefaction and the various aspects of sexual activity the feelings of revulsion which set us against both end by mingling. The taboos embodying a single dual purpose reaction may have taken shape one at a time, and one can even imagine a long time elapsing between the taboo connected with death and the one connected with reproduction (often the most perfect things take shape hesitatingly through successive modifications). But we perceive their unity none the less: we feel we are dealing with an indivisible complex, just as if ((ul))man had once and for all realised how impossible it is for nature (as a given force) to exact from the beings that she brings forth their participation in the destructive and implacable frenzy that animates her.((/ul)) ((ul))((hl))Nature demands their surrender((/hl))((/ul))((ul)); or rather she asks them to go crashing headlong to their own ruin. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Humanity became possible at the instant when((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), seized by an insurmountable dizziness, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))man tried to answer \"No\".((/hl))((/ul)) Man tried? In fact ((ul))((hl))men have never((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) definitively ((/ul))((ul))((hl))said no to violence((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) (to the excessive urges in question). In their weaker moments they have resisted nature's current but this is a momentary suspension and not a final standstill.((/ul)) We must now examine the transgressions that lie beyond the taboos."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":298}},{"tag":"Their project of self-preservation is implicated in the exploitation of others.

We feel this pressure in moments when instances of suffering and loss are expected to produce or express some reassuring meaning (everything happens for a reason; that person got what he deserved). ((ul))((hl))This mitigating process((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) typically ((/ul))((ul))((hl))happens when individuals((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) and communities ((/ul))((ul))((hl))locate death((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), suffering, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))and((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) excessive ((/ul))((ul))((hl))violence elsewhere((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), in another place and community—((/ul))((ul))((hl))a strategy that((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) often ((/ul))((ul))((hl))justifies((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) and makes acceptable ((/ul))((ul))((hl))violent projects((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) to fix((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) or restore ((/ul))((ul))((hl))that other community((/hl))((/ul)). Therefore, when Bataille says that ((ul))“death means everything” to the world of accumulation and duration((/ul)), he is thinking about how ((ul))((hl))the anxiety and horror around death is related to our commitment to qpreserving ourselves in the future((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), a commitment that involves various forms of displacement and deferral((/ul)). In other words, ((ul))((hl))the will to futurity intensifies((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))anxiety and anguish that accompany((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) thoughts and images of death, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))mortality((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), and vulnerability. ((/ul))Of course, ((ul))((hl))humans are((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) also ((/ul))((ul))((hl))fascinated((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) with images((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), and practices, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))of((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) violence and ((/ul))((ul))((hl))death, but only((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) if they can experience and view these images ((/ul))((ul))((hl))from a comfortable distance((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) or participate in these practices in a manner that reduces the risks to the self’s coherence and duration((/ul)).9 On the duplicity of the self’s relationship to violence, Bataille writes, “((ul))Violence, and death signifying violence, have a double meaning. On the one hand ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the horror of death drives us off((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), for we prefer life; on ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) other an ((/ul))((ul))((hl))element((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) at once solemn and terrifying ((/ul))((ul))((hl))fascinates us((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) and disturbs us profoundly((/ul))” (Bataille 1986, 45). What is crucial here is that the order of things, the order of life preservation, is defined over and against death and loss—((ul))((hl))death means everything to this order((/hl))((/ul)). Yet I also take Bataille to be suggesting that everyday ((ul))((hl))projects((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) and strategies ((/ul))((ul))((hl))of selfpreservation are implicated in the((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) mundane, often undetected, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))exploitation and suffering of others((/hl))((/ul)); again, death means everything to the real world. Therefore, ((ul))the human self is a site of a paradox: the world of projects, goals, and accumulation “imparts an unreal character to death even though man’s membership in this world is tied to the positing of the body as a thing insofar as it is mortal”((/ul)) (Bataille 2006, 46). According to Bataille, ((ul))((hl))our((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) general ((/ul))((ul))((hl))commitment to duration((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), to reproducing life, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))will always mean that some being((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), force, or desire ((/ul))((ul))((hl))will be marked as a threat((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) or danger to that reproduction((/ul)). And ((ul))((hl))those threats will have to be managed, assimilated, disciplined, or subordinated in some manner((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). One’s ability to endure in this world, to accumulate recognition, prestige, and various kinds of capital means that one must separate oneself, to some extent, from those qualities and characteristics that endanger self or communal projects and aspirations((/ul)). To put it differently, ((ul))((hl))life needs to be cordoned off from death and tho((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))se beings associated with death((/hl))((/ul)) (even as we know that life and death are always intertwined and that certain kinds of subjects and communities are made more vulnerable to death and its intimations). Here Bataille’s line of thought converges with Baldwin’s point about social life providing a kind of barrier to “menacing” forces, to beings and desires that signify chaos and disorder. If Baldwin and Bataille are right, then racism, which is always about marking, disciplining, and managing “dangerous” bodies and communities, must be confronted alongside fundamental social and human limitations."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":159}},{"tag":"Recognizing the mortality inherent to human existence is essential to achieve liberation.

Obviously, everyone in some way admits the importance of hazard. But this recognition is as minimal and unconscious as possible.

So that I owe to other dynamics--to lucky chance and to fleeting moments of relaxation--the minimal order and relative learning that I do have. And the rest of the time . . . Thus, as ((ul))I see it ((/ul))((ul))((hl))my thought proceeds in harmony with its object((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), an object that it attains more and perfectly the greater the state of its own ruin. Though it isn't necessarily conscious of this. At one and the same time ((/ul))((ul))((hl))my thinking must reach plenary illumination and dissolution((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) . . . In the same individual, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))thought must construct and destroy itself((/hl))((/ul)). And even that isn't quite right. Even the most rigorous thinkers yield to chance. In addition, the demands inherent in the exercise of thought often take me far from where I started. One of the great difficulties encountered by understanding is to put order into thought's interrelations in time. In a given moment, my thought reaches considerable rigor. But how to link it with yesterday's thinking? Yesterday, in a sense, I was another person, responding to other worries. Adapting one to the other remains possible, but . . . This insufficiency bothers me no more than the insufficiency relating to the many woes of the human condition generally. Humanness is related in us to nonsatisfaction, a nonsatisfaction to which we yield without accepting it, though; we distance ourselves from humanness when we regard ourselves as satisfied or when we give up searching for satisfaction. Sartre is right in relation to me to recall the myth of Sisyphus, though \"in relation to me\" here equates to \"in relation to humanity,\" I suppose. What can be expected of us is to go as far as possible and not to stop. What by contrast, humanly speaking, can be criticized are endeavors whose only meaning is some relation to moments of completion. Is it possible for me to go further? I won't wait to coordinate my efforts in that case--I'll go further. I'll take the risk. And the reader, free not to venture after me, will often take advantage of that same freedom! The critics are right to scent danger here! But let me in turn point out a greater danger, one that comes from methods that, adequate only to an outcome of knowledge, confer on individuals whom they limit a sheerly fragmentary existence--an existence that is mutilated with respect to the whole that remains inaccessible. Having recognized this, I'll defend my position. I've spoken of inner experience: my intention was to make known an object. But by proposing this vague title, I didn't want to confine myself sheerly to inner facts of that experience. It's an arbitrary procedure to reduce knowledge to what we get from our intuitions as subjects. This is something only a newborn can do. And we ourselves (who write) can only know something about this newborn by observing it from outside (the child is only our object). A separation experience, related to a vital continuum (our conception and our birth) and to a return to that continuum (in our first sexual feelings and our first laughter), leaves us without any clear recollections, and only in objective operations do we reach the core of the being we are. A phenomenology of the developed mind assumes a coincidence of subjective and objective aspects and at the same time a fusion of subject and object. * [This is the fundamental requirement of Hegel's phenomenology. Clearly, instead of responding to it, modern phenomenology, while replying to changing human thought, is only one moment among others: a sandcastle, a mirage of sorts.] This means an isolated operation is admissible only because of fatigue (so, the explanation I gave of laughter, because I was unable to develop a whole movement in tandem with a conjugation of the modalities of laughter would be left suspended--since every theory of laughter is integrally a philosophy and, similarly, every integral philosophy is a theory of laughter . . .). But that is the point--though I set forth these principles, at the same time I must renounce following them. ((ul))((hl))Thought is produced((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) in me ((/ul))((ul))((hl))as uncoordinated flashes((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), withdrawing endlessly from a term to which its movement pushes it((/ul)). I can't tell if I'm expressing human helplessness this way, or my own . . . I don't know, though I'm not hopeful of even some outwardly satisfying outcome. Isn't there an advantage in creating philosophy as I do? A flash in the night--a language belonging to a brief moment . . . Perhaps in this respect this latest moment contains a simple truth. ((ul))((hl))In order to will knowledge((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), by an indirect expedient ((/ul))((ul))((hl))I tend to become the whole universe((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). But ((/ul))((ul))((hl))in this movement I can't be a whole human being((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), since I submit to a particular goal, becoming the whole. Granted, if I could become it, I would thus be a whole human being. But in my effort, don't I distance myself from exactly that? And ((/ul))((ul))((hl))how can I become the whole without becoming a whole human being? ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))I can't be this whole human being except when I let go((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). I can't be this through willpower: my will necessarily has to will outcomes! But if misfortune (or chance) wills me to let go, then I know I am an integral, whole humanness, subordinate to nothing((/ul)). In other words, ((ul))the moment of revolt inherent in willing a knowledge beyond practical ends can't be indefinitely continued. And ((/ul))((ul))((hl))in order to be the whole universe, humankind has to let go and abandon its principle((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), accepting as the sole criterion of what it is the tendency to go beyond what it is((/ul)). This existence that I am is a revolt against existence and is indefinite desire. For this existence God was simply a stage and now here he is, looming large, grown from unfathomable experience, comically perched on the stake used for impalement. ((ul))((hl))My method has confusion as a consequence((/hl))((/ul))((ul))--and in the long run ((/ul))((ul))((hl))this confusion is unbearable((/hl))((/ul)) (particularly for me!). This is something to be corrected if possible . . . But for now, I want to elucidate the meaning of the above words. For me ((ul))((hl))nothingness is a limit of an individual existence. Beyond its defined limits((/hl))((/ul))((ul))--in time and in space--((/ul))((ul))((hl))this existence or being no longer exists((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), no longer is.

But the only ambition that can take hold of a man who, in cold blood, sees his life fulfilled in rending agony, cannot aspire to a grandeur that only extreme chance has at its disposal. This kind of violent decision, which disrupts his repose, does not necessarily entail either his vertigo or his fall in sudden death. In him, this decision may become an act and a power by which he devotes himself to the rigor whose movement ceaselessly closes in on him, as cutting as the beak of a bird of prey.

On the whole, these writings represent, moreover, less exercises strictly speaking than simple descriptions of a contemplative state or of an ecstatic contemplation. These descriptions would not even be acceptable if they were not given for what they are, in other words, as free. Only the very first text could be proposed as an exercise. While it is appropriate to use the word mysticism when speaking of \"joy before death\" and its practice, this implies no more than an affective resemblance between this practice and those of the religions of Asia or Europe. There is no reason to link any presuppositions concerning an alleged deeper reality with a joy that has no object other than immediate life.

This kind of fretful saintliness—which first had to he sheltered from erotic excess—has now lost all its power: one can only laugh at a sacred drunkenness allied with a horror of debauchery. Prudery may be healthy for backward souls, but those who would be afraid of nude girls or whisky would have little to do with \"joy before death.\" Only a shameless, indecent saintliness can lead to a sufficiently happy loss of self.

(1988–91, 2:218) ((ul))((hl))The reduction of our lives to the order of utility forces us to project ourselves endlessly into the future((/hl))((/ul)). Bataille writes of this as our anguished state, caused by this anticipation “that must be called anticipation of oneself.

It cuts us off from ourselves, severing us from the future self that is always our real and true self.((/ul)) Resisting the existential turn, however, Bataille refuses to read this denial of death as an ontological condition of humanity. For Bataille, ((ul))((hl))this is a historical((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) and economic ((/ul))((ul))((hl))denial, ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))one in which only a culture grounded in the anticipation of the future must participate((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). He frames it primarily as a problem of the intellect. In the reduction of the world to the order of utility, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))we have reduced our lives((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) and experiences ((/ul))((ul))((hl))to the order of instrumental reason((/hl))((/ul)). This order necessarily operates in a sequential temporality, facing forward toward the time when the results will be achieved, the questions solved, the theorems proved—and also when political domination will be ended and ethical an- guish quieted. As Bataille credits Hegel for seeing, “knowledge is never given to us except by unfolding in time” (1988–91, 2:202). It never appears to us except, finally, “as the result of a calculated effort, an operation useful to some end” (1988–91, 2:202)—and its utility, as we have seen, only drives it forward toward some future utility, endlessly. There are always new and future objects of thought to conquer and domesticate. Within this order of reason, death presents the cessation of the very practice of knowledge itself.((ul)) Severing us from the future objects of thought and from our future selves, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))“death prevents man from attaining himself”((/hl))((/ul)) (1988–91, 2:218). As Bataille explains, “the fear of death appears linked from the start to the projection of oneself into a future time, which [is] an effect of the positing of oneself as a thing” (1988–91, 2:218). ((ul))The ((/ul))((ul))((hl))fear of death derives from ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))the subordination to the order of utility and((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) its dominant form of the intellect, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))instrumental reason((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) While death is unarguably a part of the human condition, for Bataille ((ul))the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))fear of death((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) is a historically habituated response, one that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))grounds cultures of((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) advanced capitalism and ((/ul))((ul))((hl))phallicized whiteness((/hl))((/ul)). In those frames of late modernity, ((ul))((hl))death introduces an ontological scarcity into the very human condition: it represents((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) finitude, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the ultimate limit((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)). We must distance ourselves from such threats, and we do so((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) most often ((/ul))((ul))((hl))by ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))projecting them onto sexualized, racialized, and classed bodies((/hl))((/ul)). But for Bataille, ((ul))se((/ul))((ul))rvility to the order of knowledge is as unnecessary as servility to the order of utility. To die humanly, he argues, is to accept “the subordination of the thing”((/ul)) (1988– 91, 2:219), which places us in the schema that separates our present self from the future, desired, anticipated self: “to die humanly is to have of the future being, of the one who matters most in our eyes, the senseless idea that he is not” (1988–91, 2:219). But if we are not trapped in the endless anticipation of our future self as the index of meaning in our lives, we may not be anguished by this cessation: “((ul))((hl))If we live sovereignly, the ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))representation of death is impossible((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), for the present is not subject to the demands of the future((/ul))” (1988–91, 2:219). ((ul))((hl))To live sovereignly is not to escape death,((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) which is ontologically impossible. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))But((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) it is ((/ul))((ul))((hl))to refuse the fear((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), and subsequent attempts at disavowal, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))of death((/hl))((/ul)) as the ontological condition that defines humanity.

By contextualizing the atomic bomb in this way, Bataille was not (in the vein of someone like Churchill) attempting to diminish the significance of atomic bombs. To the contrary, driven by “the will to create a force, starting from an awareness of the misery and the grandeur of this perishable existence that has befallen us,” Bataille once 165 Bataille, Cradle of Humanity, 176. 166 Ibid, 178. 145 proclaimed: “((ul))STANDING AND FACING DESTINY remains in my eyes the essential aspect of knowledge.”((/ul))167 For him, ((ul))the nuclear bomb did not reveal a new situation((/ul)), as Anders believed, ((ul))so much as it represented the real of an old situation that seemed preoccupied with continuity but was suicidal from the start((/ul)).

This statement comes as the 'inevitable conclusion to a history of eroticism'. It is with eroticism that 'the contraries seem visibly conjoined, where the religious horror disclosed in sacrifice becomes linked to the abyss of eroticism'. 21 Two texts written in 1941 exemplify the link between horror and eroticism. 'The torment' from Inner Experience, already cited, is the companion to another text written in a different register, though one concerned, essentially, with the same experience. 'I wrote this slim volume in September and October 1941, just before 'Le Supplice' ['The torment'], which makes up the second part of L'Experience interieure. To my mind the two texts are closely interdependent and one cannot be understood without the other . . . I could not have written 'Le Supplice' if I had not first provided its lewd key.'22 Madame Edwarda has been called by Maurice Blanchot, one of the first persons to read it during the worst days of the Occupation in 1941/3 'the most beautiful narrative of our time'.24 ((ul))This narrative, like 'The torment', makes the atheological connection between inner experience and eroticism in a horrifyingly literal way((/ul)):¶ She was seated, she held one long leg stuck up in the air, to open her crack yet wider she used her fingers to draw the folds of skin apart ... 'Why', I stammered in a subdued tone, 'why are you doing that?' 'You can see for yourself ', she said, 'I'm GOD'. (p. 229)¶ ((ul))As an account of a visit to a brothel, the story is quite banal. The intensity of the experience, however, invests the encounter with the mystico-philosophical significance of 'eroticism'((/ul)), reversing the veiled pornographic flickerings of erotica. The difference Bataille suggests, in his Preface on the intentions of 'Pierre Angelique', pseudonymous author of MadameEdwarda, lies in the unusual 'gravity' with which the matter of sexual life is treated, as opposed to the customary 'making light' of it (p. 223). ((ul))((hl))In eroticism the object of desire radiates with a nocturnal brilliance((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) that reduces the subject to nothing but the infinite movement of desire itself. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))In the ecstatic movement beyond individual experience, a movement of consumption by an unattainable((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), impossible ((/ul))((ul))((hl))object of desire((/hl))((/ul)), the hero, as religious ingenu, comes to understand ((ul))the truth of Madame Edwarda's revelation: she is God, but 'GOD figured as a public whore((/ul)) and gone crazy - that, viewed through the optic of \"philosophy\", makes no sense at all' (p. 233). The non-sense of the un-knowing that manifests itself in poetic intoxication, laughter's expenditure, or ecstasy's flight, also drives eroti­ cism, dissociating it from the impulses of natural animality or sexuality. ((ul))'Eroticism, unlike simple sexual activity is a psychological quest independent of the natural goal((/ul)).,25 ((ul))Located in a psychological or psychoanalytical domain, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))eroticism constitutes one of those experiences in which the fundamental form of the human is brought into question((/hl))((/ul)).¶ For Bataille, it is woman that occupies the place where the object of desire exceeds both objectivity and subjectivity with a glimpse of an unknown infinity. That this is so is no doubt an effect of a particular cultural conjuncture: 'a new representation of woman was emerging at the center of the intellectual epic of the interwar years', Elisabeth Roudinesco argues. This representation, for the surrealists, took the shape of the female crimi­ nal. For psychoanalysis it was the 'female ecstatic' (as represented in Bernini's statue of the Ecstasy ofSaint Teresa), culminating with Madame Edwarda herself, 'a triumphant madwoman, capable of inscribing the name of God on the \"rags\" hanging from her scarlet sex'.26 Woman, in godless modernity, assumes the intermediary function of a discredited priesthood, the impossible object between finite being and infinity that guarantees sacred excess.

((ul))((hl))According to utility, an object must have((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) reference to ((/ul))((ul))((hl))some external end((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) in order to be considered meaningful((/ul)). In this mode of being-in-the-world, the tool is the primary example of meaning. Importantly, ((ul))((hl))the tool “has no value in itself” and is only meaningful “in relation to an anticipated result”((/hl))((/ul)) (Theory of Religion 28). While the truth of the tool lies in its usefulness towards a given end, the end is itself also grounded in utility. The tools of agriculture, to use Bataille’s example from Theory of Religion, are defined in terms of their usefulness to the cultivation of crops: a plow is only a plow so long as it accomplishes the goal of preparing soil for planting. The resulting food is, in turn, only valuable to the end of being eaten, which is only valuable in terms of its ability to sustain human life, which is only valuable in its ability to do work, etc. The absurdity of this “endless deferral” is matched by the equal absurdity of “a true end, which would serve no purpose” (29). Either utility continues indefinitely such that no individual thing is valuable in itself, or the utility is grounded in something which is not itself useful. ((ul))((hl))A “true end,” must be something with no use-value((/hl))((/ul)) at all. ((ul))This is true for two reasons. The first is((/ul)) clearly explicit in my preceding explanation: ((ul))there must be something at the end of the line((/ul)), so to speak, ((ul))which grounds meaning((/ul)). This is a purely logical objection. ((ul))Meaning based in utility makes impossible the very thing it purports to offer: grounded meaning.((/ul)) ((ul))The second((/ul)) necessity ((ul))deals((/ul)) instead ((ul))with Bataille’s ethical commitment to immanent subjectivity: “What a ‘true end’ reintroduces is the continuous being, lost in the world like water is lost in water”((/ul)) (29). The structure of ((ul))the tool introduces a break into the continuity of animal experiencing. In order for me to use something as a tool, it must first be distinct from me. Once it is distinct from me, I am no longer in an immanent state of continuity with my world. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))The introduction of discontinuity into((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) the indiscriminate immanence of ((/ul))((ul))((hl))existence is the condition of the possibility of a tool. To use a tool((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), therefore, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))is already to be in the realm of project((/hl))((/ul)).3 ((ul))Bataille then introduces the dimension of temporality to the critique of utility in order to critique what he calls “project,”((/ul)) though it could easily be referred to as desire. ((ul))((hl))Project denotes a mode of being-in-the-world in which time itself is experienced as an object to be enlisted in the favor of utility((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). The present becomes meaningful only insofar as its occurrences are useful in relation to the accomplishment of a (future) goal.((/ul)) The critique of this mode of being-in-the-world runs similarly to the critique of utility. ((ul))First of all, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))I will never be fulfilled((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). This is the basic problem of desire or projection: desire is constituted on a lack. I can only desire something I do not have((/ul)). More importantly, it will not actually fulfill my desire; my desire, instead, will simply reconstitute itself with a new object-cause, which will be equally unsatisfactory upon its acquisition. ((ul))((hl))The infinite regress of utility-based meaning manifests itself here as the impossibility of satisfying desire. The((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ethical ((/ul))((ul))((hl))problem of discontinuity((/hl))((/ul)), however, also ((ul))((hl))reappears with the introduction of temporality((/hl))((/ul)). Right after the above-quoted passage about animality, Bataille also notes that the goshawk eating the hen exists in a way “in which nothing is given in time…in which nothing is given beyond the present” (18). For Bataille, ((ul))((hl))the((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) very ((/ul))((ul))((hl))division of time((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) into past, present, and future ((/ul))((ul))((hl))introduces discontinuity((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) and transcendence ((/ul))((ul))((hl))into the continuous oneness of immanence. This discontinuity is((/hl))((/ul)), for Bataille, ((ul))((hl))the underlying problem of utility((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))as well. ((ul))The idea of ((/ul))((ul))((hl))discontinuity((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), either between subject and object or among past, present, and future, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))is the condition of the possibility of utility’s emergence((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). Nick Land explains, “Bataille’s thought of ((/ul))((ul))((hl))discontinuity((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) is more intricate than his fluent deployment of the word might indicate. It ((/ul))((ul))((hl))is the condition for transcendent illusion((/hl))((/ul))((ul))”((/ul)) (Land 64). ((ul))In this way the same critique of deferral applies to discontinuity: “Discontinuity is not ontologically grounded but positively fabricated”((/ul)) (64). ((ul))The groundlessness of discontinuity is not,((/ul)) then, ((ul))accidental to the groundlessness of deferral, but rather constitutive of it. ((/ul))Finally, ((ul))((hl))Bataille applies the critiques of utility((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) and project ((/ul))((ul))((hl))to the practice of discursive reason((/hl))((/ul)). Broadly speaking, ((ul))discursive reason is the practice of philosophy understood as explanation. Insofar as ((/ul))((ul))((hl))discursive reasoning((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) always occurs within the context of elucidating something for a higher end, usually “truth,” it ((/ul))((ul))((hl))is based in project and utility((/hl))((/ul)). In contradistinction to this approach to philosophy, Bataille poses “sovereign nonknowledge”—a way of philosophizing that does not attempt to elucidate transcendent truths, but rather forces the reader into an experience (“Nonknowledge” 196). ((ul))((hl))Discursive reason also rests on the distinction between subject and object((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). In order to define something for explication or exploration, one must first delimit it from the manifold. I cannot give an account of what a chair is without first designating that a chair is some object distinct from all other possible objects in the world.((/ul)) This ontological problem of discursive reason points to the role that language plays in Bataille’s thought. ((ul))((hl))Language rests on this((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) same ((/ul))((ul))((hl))dividing up of the world((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). It rests on the ability to define a subject as distinct from an object. Even if I proclaim that I am thinking about myself, syntax necessitates that there is an “I” who is thinking (subject) and an “I” which is being thought about (object). This structural necessity is,((/ul)) for Bataille, “((ul))one of the most fateful aberrations of language”((/ul)) (Theory of Religion 28). ((ul))Bataille’s non-knowledge, then, cannot simply be expressed in discursive language. Instead Bataille engages what Michael Sells calls “unsaying,” ((/ul))((ul))((hl))perverting and twisting language against itself in order to “engage the ineffable”((/hl))((/ul)) (Sells 3). In these critiques ((ul))((hl))Bataille attempts to elucidate and undermine the very basis of transcendent subjectivity—discontinuity. The calling into question of the structure of discontinuity, between subject and world, between I and thou, undergirds all of Bataille’s thought.((/hl))((/ul))"],"stats":{"highlightedWords":240}},{"tag":"Solves all your biz","cite":"-about poetry in general, but more explicitly about the poem that’s the discontinuity alt so you should probably read this with that","text":["Bataille 57 (Georges Bataille, crazy librarian, “L'Erotisme,” or “Erotism: Death and Sensuality,” originally published in 1957 ///ghs-sc)","I spoke of mystical experience, not of poetry.

For Trungpa, the sun is a symbol of basic goodness, and the human capacity to awaken to it, to become enlightened. For Bataille, the sun is the material starting point for earthly life, and thus his phi- losophy. ((ul))“((/ul))((ul))((hl))Solar energy((/hl))((/ul))((ul)),” writes Bataille, “((/ul))((ul))((hl))is the source of life’s exuberant development((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). The origin and essence of our wealth are given in the radiation of the sun, which dispenses energy—wealth—without any return.”65 The sun offers our planet enough energy in one hour to meet contemporary civilizational needs for an entire year((/ul)).66 Harnessing this energy, to be sure, is a massive technological challenge. Moreover, biological life only has limited access to the superabundance of solar energy that hits the planet every day. But the amount of energy we can access enables an energetically rich life. ((ul))Bataille’s materialist analysis of solar lavishness helpfully concretizes Trungpa’s account of basic goodness, what he also referred to as “basic richness.”((/ul))67 While Trungpa o ers practices for people to feel their inherent goodness and richness, actually experiencing this goodness takes time.68 Without spending hours meditating, and slowly uncovering a tender and radiating heart, Trungpa’s teachings on basic goodness and richness can appear ideal- istic. ((ul))Bataille’s materialist account of solar generosity further evidences Trungpa’s philosophy; it offers strong conceptual proof that can heighten commitment to the experiential practice of meditation. “ ((/ul))((ul))((hl))The sun gives without ever receiving((/hl))((/ul))((ul)),” argues Bataille. ((/ul))“[Humans] were conscious of this long before astrophysics measured that ceaseless prodigality; they saw it ripen the harvests and they associated its splen- dor with the act of someone who gives without receiving.”69At a basic biological level, the sun’s exuberance means that “on the surface of the globe, for living matter in general, energy is always in excess, the ques- tion is always posed in terms of extravagance.”70 Put more succinctly: “((ul))((hl))We receive more energy than we can use((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).”((/ul))71 e basic planetary con- dition is wealth more than poverty. ((ul))The essential meaning of Bataille’s claim that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))luxury((/hl))((/ul))((ul))—not necessity—((/ul))((ul))((hl))organizes life on earth((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) is that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))all organisms have access to more energy than required((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) for subsistence, thanks to the sun’s exuberance((/ul))((ul)), is ((/ul))((ul))((hl))excess is often invested in biological growth((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) (at the level of an organism, species, or ecosystem). But ((/ul))((ul))((hl))growth can never fully exhaust the energy available((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) to an individual organism or biological system. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))All organisms and systems are left with a surplus to spend((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) “willingly or not, gloriously or catastrophically.”((/ul))72 Evidence of earthly richness includes the ornate colors and plumage of the animal kingdom that seemingly exceed evolutionary use-value. Similarly, consider the capacity for pleasure su using animal life, espe- cially all the sexualized pleasures apparently unrelated to procreation. Even when a sensory pleasure is associated with basic functioning like a good sneeze, excretion, or stretch, there can still be sumptuousness to the sensation (need it feel so good?). A sneeze is arguably basic good- ness at work, a ash of solar exuberance amidst our everyday lives. Consider, also, the ubiquity of queerness across the animal king- dom. According to Bruce Bagemihl, author of Biological Exuberance (a book that draws heavily from Bataille), “homosexuality is found in virtually all animal groups, in virtually all geographic areas and time periods, and in a wide variety of forms.”73 But why, asks Bagemihl, “does same-sex activity persist—reappearing in species after species, generation after generation, individual after individual—when it is not useful” from a strictly evolutionary perspective?74 Bagemihl’s answer is that use and necessity are not life’s sole organizing principles: “Natural systems are driven as much by abundance and excess as they are by limitation and practicality. Seen in this light, homosexuality and non- reproductive heterosexuality are ‘expected’ occurrences—they are one manifestation of an overall ‘extravagance’ of biological systems that has many expressions.”75 ((ul))For Bataille, our primordial condition is marked by richness thanks to the lavishness of the sun. And then, of course, we die. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Death can easily appear as proof of our ultimate poverty((/hl))((/ul))((ul)); it seemingly mocks attempts to assert the basic richness or goodness of life. But Bataille reads mortality as another marker of life’s luxuriousness. ((/ul))Large mam- mals like us are impressive condensations of energy (we are ourselves only possible given energetic wealth). is ((ul))((hl))energy is((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) then extravagantly ((/ul))((ul))((hl))squandered upon our necessary deaths. “When we curse death((/hl))((/ul))((ul)),” argues Bataille, “((/ul))((ul))((hl))we only fear ourselves((/hl))((/ul))((ul))... We lie to ourselves when we dream of escaping the movement of luxurious exuberance of which we are only the most intense form.”76 ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Death’s energetic squandering is((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) also ((/ul))((ul))((hl))an ecological gift((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) for((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))new life((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) arising from decay: ((/ul))((ul))((hl))“[Humankind] conspires to ignore the fact that ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))death is also the youth of things((/hl))((/ul)).”77 Bataille’s reading of death as exemplary of basic goodness supports Trungpa’s encouragement to ((ul))“((/ul))((ul))((hl))make friends with our death((/hl))((/ul))((ul)),” and to not resentfully cast it as “a defeat and as an insult.”78 Tibetan culture, according to Bataille, is more successful than Euro-American ones at affirming the totality of life.((/ul)) For Bataille, cultur- al forms that communicate this a rmation are glorious expenditures of basic energetic wealth. e resentment that animates so many Eu- ro-American cultural forms is itself enabled by energetic exuberance, a “catastrophic” use of our basic richness.79 And the Euro-American desire to escape our corporeality only intensi es feelings of lack and malaise by disconnecting us from the earthly exuberance alive in our changeful bodies. For Bataille: ((ul))Anguish arises when the anxious individual is not himself stretched tight by the feeling of superabundance((/ul)). is is precisely what evinces the isolated, individual character of anguish. ere can be anguish only from a personal, par- ticular point of view that is radically opposed to the general point of view based on the exuberance of living matter as a whole. Anguish is meaningless for someone who over ows with life, and for life as a whole, which is an over owing by its very nature.80 Energetic poverty and lack are realities for life on earth. But they are always felt by particular beings at particular times; energetic lack is not our general or basic condition. And yet the more we separate ourselves from exuberant life energies in attempts to gain dominion over them, the more liable we are to experience lack; we progressively remove our- selves from nature’s over ow. Bataille was interested in nurturing a sovereign—rather than ser- vile—human encounter with existence: “ e sovereignty I speak of has little to do with the sovereignty of states... I speak in general of an aspect that is opposed to the servile and the subordinate.”81 Viewing humans as agents of life’s exuberance, Bataille saw sovereignty as hu- manity’s “primordial condition.”82 ((ul))We are regal and rich from birth. But this ((/ul))((ul))((hl))sovereignty is tarnished when we cower before ourselves and the teeming life energies we issue from((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), return to, and are animated by.((/ul))"],"stats":{"highlightedWords":133}},{"tag":"Death resides at the center of the general economy – it functions as the ultimate form of expidenture.

Bataille's notion of ((ul))death is((/ul)) an empty version of Hegel's: it is ((ul))negativity, but one that cannot be recuperated((/ul)), even if all our actions can be seen as attempts at such a recuperation. ((ul))Death is the loss that defines our existence as individuals, since sexual reproduction is absolutely caught up with the death of the individual((/ul)); unlike amoebae, there is no continuity of Being from one organism to the next (The Accursed Share, 32; OC VII, 39. See also Eroticism, 12-15; OCX, 17-21). Death, then, is as much part of the inherent wastefulness in nature as life. ((ul))((hl))Death seems((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) to us like ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the most wasteful form((/hl))((/ul)), but for Bataille, such a conception is to be left behind (not ignored or overcome): 'the luxury of death is regarded by us in the same way as that of sexuality, first as a negation of ourselves, then - in a sudden reversal - as the profound truth of that movement of which life is the manifestation (The Accursed Share, 34-5; OC VII, 41). Is death then in some way the truth of Bataille's system? At points it recalls Heidegger's notion of 'Being toward death', but as with many of Bataille's notions, the whole issue of centrality is open to question even as it is posed. Bataille argues that it will always be possible to show that whichever primordial fact gets priority presuppose s the existence of anothe r one (The Accursed Share, vol. II, 82; OC VIII, 71). 1 Death features in early writings - 'beings only die to be born', 'Solar Anus', 7; OC I, 84), and become s something that does not transcend the individual so much as lose the individual in a generalized excess. Instead of Hegel's mastery of death, ((ul))we see that in the fact that life and death are passionately devoted to the subsidence of the void, the relation of master/slave subordination is no longer revealed, but life and void are confused and mingled like lovers, in the convulsive moments of the end. ((/ul))('Sacrifices', 133; OC I, 93 trans, mod.) ((ul))Instead of giving in to death, accepting it at a distance, as the distancing that structure s Being (Heidegger), ((/ul))((ul))((hl))death is to be embraced((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), as 'it appears that no less a loss than ((/ul))((ul))((hl))death is needed for the brilliance of life((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) to traverse and transfigure dull existence((/ul)) (Th e Practice of Joy Before Death', 239; OC I, 557). This is not because death is so marvellous, but because it is everywhere, linking the individual to everything else (what Bataille will go on to call the general economy): I can only perceive a succession of cruel splendours whose very movement requires that I die: this death is only the exploding consumption of all that was, the joy of existence of all that comes into the world; even my own life demands that everything that exists, everywhere, ceaselessly give itself and be annihilated. (The Practice of Joy Before Death', 239; OCI, 557) Bataille is not arguing from the perspective whereby the universe only exists in one's own mind, but that even we, pathetic individuals that we are, feature in the ceaseless process of death and destruction. This linkage of the individual, throug h death, to others, to the general economy, is what is pursued in Bataille's connecting of the erotic with death, which is a development of the linkage between sex and death. In Eroticism he uses the term 'continuity to designate both the state of shared existence of asexual reproduction and what lies beyond individuality when individuals lose themselves in sacrifice, erotic activity, laughter, drunkenness and so on (Eroticism, 11-25; OCX, 17-30). These attempts interest him because 'eroticism opens the way to death. Death opens the way to the denial of our individual selves (24; 29). Death 57 The second volume of The Accursed Share, subtitled The History of Eroticism, is often seen as being little more than a draft version of Eroticism, but there are crucial differences in emphasis. The History of Eroticism really is a genuine part of the work on 'the accursed share', whereas such an economy is only implicit in Eroticism. More importantly still, the former seeks to link sexuality to death, and the latter attempts the opposite movement (both movements, for no clear theoretically necessary reason, lead Bataille to associate Woman with death). The second volume of The Accursed Share even starts by stating that it is not really about eroticism, but is instead 'a thinking that does not fall apart in the face of horror', emerging from 'a system of thought exhausting the totality of the possible (The Accursed Share, vol. II, 14; OC VIII, 10). In writing about death as part of the general economy, it also emerges that death is not necessarily literal death. But we should on no account take it as simply a metaphor, as metaphors imply a reality to be represented, and Bataille offers no such real world, existing to be represented in mimesis, metaphor or metonymy. ((ul))Death and Fear ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Hegel sees death as the origin of((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) humanity's ((/ul))((ul))((hl))self-consciousness((/hl))((/ul)) (this being, initially, consciousness of death), ((ul))and the rest of time consists of the struggle to master death.((/ul)) Communal existence is also centred around death, and the two combine in the form of architecture. According to Hollier, for Hegel, ((ul))'architecture is something appearing in the place of death, to point out its presence and to cover it up: the victory of death and the victory over death'((/ul)) (Against Architecture, 6). For Bataille, however, this is precisely the problem: our society is this fearful covering up of death (whereas the Aztecs, for example, exposed death in the sacrifice - at the top of, rather than inside, the pyramid). 2 In The Accursed Share, vol. II, he argues that ((ul))all ((/ul))((ul))((hl))society((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), all individual existence ((/ul))(as opposed to the restricted economy of modern individualism) ((ul))((hl))emerges from this fear of death((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) - and this fear is at its most creative when it approaches death. ((/ul))58 Georges Bataille At the same time as ((ul))humanity is drawn toward death,((/ul)) it pushes it away - ((ul))this repulsion is what defines humanity. ((/ul))Repulsion is the key word, as ((ul))death is not simply a negativity, something that happens to the subject, but something that, even when it happens to someone else, provokes disgust. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Humanity is defined by its 'repugnance for death((/hl))((/ul))/ (The Accursed Share, vol. II, 61; OC VIII, 51). This is hardly a novel or shocking statement, but ((ul))death is specifically part of what repels us because we repel it, and arguably the (primordial) object of disgust (and only in becoming human does death constitute something disgusting). ((/ul))Humans have a horror of all that threatens their unitary existence: excretions, filth, loss of control through drunkenness, eroticism (61-2; 51-2). More than this, we also have a horror of life, as at some level we are aware of life as a by-product of death, so much so that 'we might think, if need be, that living((ul)) ((/ul))matter on the very level we separate ourselves from it is the privileged object of our disgust (63; 52). All such disgusts are caught up within taboos, in a relation where it is impossible to ascertain whether the taboo created the disgust, or responds to it. For Bataille, however, death really is at the heart of the existence of taboo, but is not the exclusive centre: since it goes without saying, I will not linger over the possible anteriority of the horror of death. This horror is perhaps at the root of our repugnance (the loathing of nothingness would then be at the origin of the loathing of decay, which is not physical since it is not shared by animals) . It is clear, in any event, that the nature of excrement is analogous to that of corpses and that the places of its emission are close to the sexual parts; more often than not, this complex of prohibitions appears inextricable. (79; 68) This complex marks the line of demarcation between human and other and proximity to these phenomena constitutes the crossing of this line. This crossing and the fear of crossing gives the 'universally human character of the problem of obscenity (54; 45), even if contra Freud and Levi-Strauss, for example, there is no particular taboo that is universal.3 ((ul))((hl))Death((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) is also 'at the beginning insofar as its appearance ((/ul))((ul))((hl))coincides with labour and utility - this is what makes death a problem((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) for the individual, as ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the individual conceives of his or her self as something to be maintained((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), preserved and developed((/ul)) (82; 70) .((ul))((hl))Death((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) very rapidly ((/ul))((ul))((hl))becomes the site of prohibition((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), and takes two principal forms: both murder and 'contact with corpses are forbidden((/ul)) (79; 68). It is not the metaphysical difficulty of impending death that creates this fear, since this arises from an awareness that life is an accident between waste and decay, with only waste and decay in between. As Bataille notes, life is a luxury of which death is the highest degree (85-6; 74) and 'moreover, life is a product of putrefaction (80; 69), so ((ul))death and decay are linked to conceptions of our birth and origin ((/ul))(for him, this accounts for 'our fear of menstrual blood, for example). Here, as elsewhere, it is striking how far Bataille goes down a road attacking preconceptions only to launch into a restatement of tired cliches about 'woman as other, as death. He simply does not question the taboos around 'woman', and this is why Kristeva's gloss on Bataille (Powers of Horror) and Mary Douglas's Purity and Danger is so successful - it completes the logic already under way. The all-pervasive absence, or denial, of death, through prohibition, is why death is to be approached, and also why we have an attraction to as well as repulsion from death and all that threatens our identity, so that for example, 'eroticism, it may be said, is assenting to life up to the point of death (Eroticism, 11; OCX, 17). Death and eroticism remain charged with danger, and create anguish in individuals as their individuality falls away (The Accursed Share, vol. II, 101; OC VIII, 88) . 5 But as with Hegel's 'facing up to death', Bataille does not limit the notion of death to actual biological death - it comes to include all that undoes the individual, such that the introduction, or irruption, of death into life makes life become exuberant (99; 86). Erotic activity, for example, must be carried out intensely (otherwise it is just sex), for 'if the sensations do not have their greatest intensity, it is possible for us to isolate objects on the field of the totality (118-19; 102). By totality, ((ul))Bataille does not mean the kinds of ideology that account for everything, but the amorphous sphere beyond subjects, and beyond a simple subject/object divide. Even if death is not real, there is no reduction of the experience of approaching death((/ul)) (we can never attain death - in this Bataille is with Heidegger). If ((ul))((hl))we are instructed that to 'live life to the full we must 'embrace death'((/hl))((/ul)), what do we gain? Nothing much, except the awareness of an impossibility (we do not even gain nothing, as asceticism would aspire to), but what will have happened is the following: the embrace restores us, not to nature (which is itself, if it is not reintegrated, only a detached part), but rather to the totality in which man has his share by losing himself. For an embrace is not just a fall into the animal muck, but the anticipation of death, and the putrefaction that follows it. (119; 103) There is no why, however, and there can only be Virtuar replies to 'why? - i.e. ((ul))((hl))there can be the project of approaching death((/hl))((/ul)), as it enhances subjectivity, ((ul))but ((/ul))((ul))((hl))this project is lost at the moment it is attained,((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) whether in actual death or in death-like experience (nonexperience).((/ul)) Note also that the only 'return is to something that is necessarily lost, again and again. Eroticism, then, is one direction waste or excess can take that involves death (itself waste, excess), but ((ul))Bataille also hints at another level at which death can be approached - a level that really is metaphorical.((/ul))"],"stats":{"highlightedWords":126}},{"tag":"Death is the most luxurious form of life.

Therefore, ((ul))the human self is a site of a paradox: the world of projects, goals, and accumulation “imparts an unreal character to death even though man’s membership in this world is tied to the positing of the body as a thing insofar as it is mortal”((/ul)) (Bataille 2006, 46). According to Bataille, ((ul))((hl))our((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) general ((/ul))((ul))((hl))commitment to duration((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), to reproducing life, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))will always mean that some being((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), force, or desire ((/ul))((ul))((hl))will be marked as a threat((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) or danger to that reproduction((/ul)). And ((ul))((hl))those threats will have to be managed, assimilated, disciplined, or subordinated in some manner((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). One’s ability to endure in this world, to accumulate recognition, prestige, and various kinds of capital means that one must separate oneself, to some extent, from those qualities and characteristics that endanger self or communal projects and aspirations((/ul)). To put it differently, ((ul))((hl))life needs to be cordoned off from death and tho((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))se beings associated with death((/hl))((/ul)) (even as we know that life and death are always intertwined and that certain kinds of subjects and communities are made more vulnerable to death and its intimations). Here Bataille’s line of thought converges with Baldwin’s point about social life providing a kind of barrier to “menacing” forces, to beings and desires that signify chaos and disorder. If Baldwin and Bataille are right, then racism, which is always about marking, disciplining, and managing “dangerous” bodies and communities, must be confronted alongside fundamental social and human limitations."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":159}},{"tag":"Recognizing the mortality inherent to human existence is essential to achieve liberation.

Since appearance constitutes a limit, what truly exists is a dissolution into common opacity rather than a development of lucid thinking. The apparent unchangingness of books is deceptive: each book is also the sum of the misunderstandings it occasions((/ul)). ((ul))So why exhaust myself with efforts toward consciousness? I can only make fun of myself as I write. (Why write even a phrase if laughter doesn't immediately join me?)((/ul)) It goes without saying that, for the task, I bring to bear whatever rigor I have within me. But the crumbling nature of thinking's awareness of itself and especially the certainty of ((ul))((hl))thinking reaching its end only in failing((/hl))((/ul)), hinder any repose and prevent the relaxed state that facilitates a rigorous disposition of things. Committed to the casual stance--((ul))((hl))I think((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) and express myself ((/ul))((ul))((hl))in the free play of hazard((/hl))((/ul)). Obviously, everyone in some way admits the importance of hazard. But this recognition is as minimal and unconscious as possible. ((ul))Going my way unconstrained, unhampered, I develop my thoughts, make choices with regard to expression--but I don't have the control over myself that I want. And the actual dynamic of my intelligence is equally uncontrollable((/ul)). So that I owe to other dynamics--to lucky chance and to fleeting moments of relaxation--the minimal order and relative learning that I do have. And the rest of the time . . . Thus, as ((ul))I see it ((/ul))((ul))((hl))my thought proceeds in harmony with its object((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), an object that it attains more and perfectly the greater the state of its own ruin. Though it isn't necessarily conscious of this. At one and the same time ((/ul))((ul))((hl))my thinking must reach plenary illumination and dissolution((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) . . . In the same individual, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))thought must construct and destroy itself((/hl))((/ul)). And even that isn't quite right. Even the most rigorous thinkers yield to chance. In addition, the demands inherent in the exercise of thought often take me far from where I started. One of the great difficulties encountered by understanding is to put order into thought's interrelations in time. In a given moment, my thought reaches considerable rigor. But how to link it with yesterday's thinking? Yesterday, in a sense, I was another person, responding to other worries. Adapting one to the other remains possible, but . . . This insufficiency bothers me no more than the insufficiency relating to the many woes of the human condition generally. Humanness is related in us to nonsatisfaction, a nonsatisfaction to which we yield without accepting it, though; we distance ourselves from humanness when we regard ourselves as satisfied or when we give up searching for satisfaction. Sartre is right in relation to me to recall the myth of Sisyphus, though \"in relation to me\" here equates to \"in relation to humanity,\" I suppose. What can be expected of us is to go as far as possible and not to stop. What by contrast, humanly speaking, can be criticized are endeavors whose only meaning is some relation to moments of completion. Is it possible for me to go further? I won't wait to coordinate my efforts in that case--I'll go further. I'll take the risk. And the reader, free not to venture after me, will often take advantage of that same freedom! The critics are right to scent danger here! But let me in turn point out a greater danger, one that comes from methods that, adequate only to an outcome of knowledge, confer on individuals whom they limit a sheerly fragmentary existence--an existence that is mutilated with respect to the whole that remains inaccessible. Having recognized this, I'll defend my position. I've spoken of inner experience: my intention was to make known an object. But by proposing this vague title, I didn't want to confine myself sheerly to inner facts of that experience. It's an arbitrary procedure to reduce knowledge to what we get from our intuitions as subjects. This is something only a newborn can do. And we ourselves (who write) can only know something about this newborn by observing it from outside (the child is only our object). A separation experience, related to a vital continuum (our conception and our birth) and to a return to that continuum (in our first sexual feelings and our first laughter), leaves us without any clear recollections, and only in objective operations do we reach the core of the being we are. A phenomenology of the developed mind assumes a coincidence of subjective and objective aspects and at the same time a fusion of subject and object. * [This is the fundamental requirement of Hegel's phenomenology. Clearly, instead of responding to it, modern phenomenology, while replying to changing human thought, is only one moment among others: a sandcastle, a mirage of sorts.] This means an isolated operation is admissible only because of fatigue (so, the explanation I gave of laughter, because I was unable to develop a whole movement in tandem with a conjugation of the modalities of laughter would be left suspended--since every theory of laughter is integrally a philosophy and, similarly, every integral philosophy is a theory of laughter . . .). But that is the point--though I set forth these principles, at the same time I must renounce following them. ((ul))((hl))Thought is produced((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) in me ((/ul))((ul))((hl))as uncoordinated flashes((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), withdrawing endlessly from a term to which its movement pushes it((/ul)). I can't tell if I'm expressing human helplessness this way, or my own . . . I don't know, though I'm not hopeful of even some outwardly satisfying outcome. Isn't there an advantage in creating philosophy as I do? A flash in the night--a language belonging to a brief moment . . . Perhaps in this respect this latest moment contains a simple truth. ((ul))((hl))In order to will knowledge((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), by an indirect expedient ((/ul))((ul))((hl))I tend to become the whole universe((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). But ((/ul))((ul))((hl))in this movement I can't be a whole human being((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), since I submit to a particular goal, becoming the whole. Granted, if I could become it, I would thus be a whole human being. But in my effort, don't I distance myself from exactly that? And ((/ul))((ul))((hl))how can I become the whole without becoming a whole human being? ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))I can't be this whole human being except when I let go((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). I can't be this through willpower: my will necessarily has to will outcomes! But if misfortune (or chance) wills me to let go, then I know I am an integral, whole humanness, subordinate to nothing((/ul)). In other words, ((ul))the moment of revolt inherent in willing a knowledge beyond practical ends can't be indefinitely continued. And ((/ul))((ul))((hl))in order to be the whole universe, humankind has to let go and abandon its principle((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), accepting as the sole criterion of what it is the tendency to go beyond what it is((/ul)). This existence that I am is a revolt against existence and is indefinite desire. For this existence God was simply a stage and now here he is, looming large, grown from unfathomable experience, comically perched on the stake used for impalement. ((ul))((hl))My method has confusion as a consequence((/hl))((/ul))((ul))--and in the long run ((/ul))((ul))((hl))this confusion is unbearable((/hl))((/ul)) (particularly for me!). This is something to be corrected if possible . . . But for now, I want to elucidate the meaning of the above words. For me ((ul))((hl))nothingness is a limit of an individual existence. Beyond its defined limits((/hl))((/ul))((ul))--in time and in space--((/ul))((ul))((hl))this existence or being no longer exists((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), no longer is. For us, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))that nonbeing is filled with meaning: ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))I know I can be reduced to nothing((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)).

((ul))((hl))If inner experience were not aimless((/hl))((/ul))((ul))—if it had a simple, definitive outcome—((/ul))((ul))((hl))the outcome would be knowledge((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). And experience is necessarily different from methods of contemplation and contestation which set out with knowledge as their outcome. Hence inner experience’s relation to nonknowledge: ((/ul))((ul))((hl))inner experience produces some absence of knowledge, and it does not seek knowledge((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) or anything in particular as a goal, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))paving the way for nonknowledge((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). Inner experience is also different from “methods” which require an individual to live a “fragmentary existence((/ul)),” separate and apart from some “whole” which remains inaccessible to them. This ((ul))separation from some whole is a greater danger than the danger of a task as Sisyphean as endless contestation.((/ul)) Bataille’s claim that ((ul))inner experience is not the kind of method which requires individuals to live fragmentedly,((/ul)) and separate, from some essential whole recalls his distinction between “continuity” and “discontinuity.” ((ul))Bataille is suggesting that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))inner experience allows him to live with access to a whole((/hl))((/ul))((ul))—as part of the whole—that would otherwise((/ul)) (with other methods) ((ul))remain inaccessible((/ul)). The method which ((ul))entails inaccessibility to the whole recalls discontinuity, and the method of being part of or caught up in the whole((/ul)) (inner experience) ((ul))recalls continuity((/ul)). It matters little what particular “method” or methods Bataille is using to describe inner experience. ((ul))What matters in identifying such methods is that they are ((/ul))((ul))((hl))methods that expect knowledge((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) as the outcome and that they achieve the outcome by ((/ul))((ul))((hl))limit((/hl))((/ul))((ul))ing ((/ul))((ul))((hl))individuals to ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))fragmentary existences((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) without access to the whole of which they are seeking part (in the form of “knowledge”). ((/ul))We will not see this concern for continuity in our virtue epistemology conversation, nor will we see knowledge characterized as fragmenting, or splintering. In Sensible Ecstasy, Amy Hollywood offers her analysis of Jean-Paul Sartre’s critique of Bataille in relation to Bataille’s desire for continuity over and above any desire for identifiable outcomes: “Sartre’s and Bataille’s opposing attitudes toward human projects are crucial here. Sartre insists that to be human is to engage in projects; ((ul))Bataille argues that inner experience is the opposite of project”((/ul)) (30). (And inner experience is especially not a project of self-improvement.) ((ul))Thus Bataille “generates endlessly recursive negations of his own attempt to provide a method for attaining inner experience((/ul))” (ibid). ((ul))According to Hollywood, this is ultimately the problem Sartre has with all of Inner ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Experience((/hl))((/ul))((ul)); that is, it has no method, it offers no clear goal, it ((/ul))((ul))((hl))is useless((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), it is not a ((/ul))project. “For Sartre, if inner experience does not give rise to new enterprises it is worth nothing more than ‘the pleasure of drinking a glass of alcohol or of warming oneself in the sun at the beach’ [ON 173]. Such experiences are, for Sartre, ‘useless’” (SE 31). Excesses are permissible for Sartre, Hollywood writes, as long as they are channeled fully into project—whether the project is political or personal. “Only if these excesses are contained by project can they be meaningful and useful” (SE 33). However, the intoxication that inner experience and its nonmeaning produce are all we need to reply to Sartre: ((ul))((hl))nonmeaning is not a total absence of meaning. Nonmeaning provides((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) some kind of ((/ul))((ul))((hl))meaning in the form((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) of intoxication, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))of ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))affect((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). We will see that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the same is true of nonknowledge((/hl))((/ul))((ul)): nonknowledge is not a total absence of knowledge, and its clearest meaning is an affective meaning. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Nonknowledge does not have a((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) particular kind of ((/ul))((ul))((hl))recuperable use((/hl))((/ul)). Inner Experience, Inner Experience, and Nonknowledge ((ul))Bataille closes his reply to Sartre with a description of inner experience itself: it is the movement of “willing a knowledge beyond practical ends((/ul))” (ON 176). Bataille acknowledges that ((ul))this willing “can’t be indefinitely continued((/ul))” (ibid). ((ul))((hl))Knowledge “beyond practical ends” is nonknowledge((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). Inner Experience((/ul)) (the text and the concept) ((ul))is thus a method and a non-method for arriving at nonknowledge((/ul)). If reading ((ul))Inner Experience((/ul)) moves one to pursue experience, it ((ul))opens up the possibility of arriving at nonknowledge((/ul)). The “((ul))method” inspires anguish because it produces only knowledge beyond practical ends—useless pseudo-knowledge((/ul)). The ((ul))method looks, sounds, and seems like mystical ecstasy from the outside, but, according to Bataille, it can be and is understood differently from the “inside((/ul))55.” The method of ((ul))((hl))inner experience((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) is not just an avenue to nonknowledge; it ((/ul))((ul))((hl))is((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) partially ((/ul))((ul))((hl))constitutive of nonknowledge.

((/ul))Until that shift occurs, Congress and the DOI should take practical steps to redress the Freedmen's harm. The BIA should act as it did in the Seminole Nation case, refusing to recognize the election results and engage in government-to-government relations until the Freedmen's citizenship status is reinstated. Furthermore, Congress could strengthen the ICRA by adding a cause of action so that injured parties, such as the Freedmen, can seek recourse for civil rights violations in federal court.

It is almost impossible for the individuals selected to oppose this collective decision because they and their families would otherwise become isolated in the community.","The diagram illustrates ((ul))the complexity of decisions regarding migration. Factors on three different levels influence the decision to stay or leave((/ul)). At the macro-level, changes in politics, economics, society, environment, demographics and land use, as well as conflicts and war, play a role. Although each of these factors can be the most important driver of migration, ((ul))people often decide to leave their home or stay when changes in several of these areas coincide. Changes in one area affect other areas, potentially causing the overall situation of inhabitants to greatly deteriorate((/ul)) (or improve). If climate change continues to advance, worsening or even destroying the livelihoods of more and more people, it will become a more significant factor. Of key importance, of course, is whether the targeted region or country will even permit entry and residence.","Specific contexts (meso-level in the diagram) also contribute to decisions on migration. Social networks in the homeland and in the diaspora can act both as drivers or inhibitors of migration. Agencies for recruiting workers outside the region simplify migration.

But ((ul))it isn’t clear whether there is much evidence for this link between climate change and conflict((/ul)) — there certainly seems to be no consensus within the academic literature.","In our recent paper, my student Erin Owain and I decided to test the climate-conflict hypothesis, using East Africa as our focus. The region is already very hot and very poor, making it especially vulnerable to climate change (in fact neighbouring Chad is by some measures the single most vulnerable country in the world).","As the planet warms, East Africa’s seasonal rains are expected to become much more unpredictable. This is a particular problem as recent economic development has been concentrated in agriculture, a highly climate-sensitive sector that accounts for more than half of the entire economy in countries like Ethiopia or Sudan. One study led by the European Commission found that declining rainfall over the past century may have reduced GDP across Africa by 15-40 percent compared with the rest of the developing world.","East Africa also has a long history of conflict and human displacement, which persists in some countries to this day, such as the civil wars in Sudan and Somalia. The UN Refugee Agency reports there were more than 20 million displaced people in Africa in 2016 — a third of the world’s total. The World Bank predicts this could rise up to 86 million by 2050 due to climate change.","To test the climate-conflict hypothesis, ((ul))Erin and I therefore focused on the 10 main countries in East Africa.

Halvard Buhaug, a professor at the Peace Research Institute Oslo, looked at the same questions in 2015 and his study reached much the same conclusion: sociopolitical factors were more important than climate change.","Things were different for “refugees,” however — those displaced people who were forced to cross borders between countries. ((ul))Refugee numbers were related to the usual demographic and socio-economic factors((/ul)).

((/ul))However, it is important to note that their study does not show any evidence of armed conflicts being directly triggered by climate-related disasters, but simply an occasional and infrequent temporal coincidence. In a study on the link between environmental scarcity and conflict in 39 Sub-Saharan countries, Bell and Keys (2016) identified ((ul))three socio-political conditions that explain the link between environmental scarcity and civil conflict: social vulnerability, unequal resource distribution and the capacity of the state((/ul)).

A study by Hegre et al.

Investigating the possibility that climate affects conflict risk through economic challenges, van Weezel (2013) studied rainfall and conflict patterns between 1981 and 2010 in Sub- Saharan Africa and concluded that ((ul))there is no robust link between rainfall failure, an important determinant of crop failure in Sub-Saharan Africa, and conflict onset((/ul)), directly or indirectly. A study by Ayana et al. (2016) focused on pastoralists in East Africa, and found that ((ul))livelihood stresses due to rainfall and forage yields fail to predict the occurrence and location of conflicts((/ul)). Bergholt and Lujala (2012) have demonstrated that even the indirect link between climate change and conflict is suspect. The authors used historical data for the period 1980–2007 to show that ((ul))severe and frequent climate-induced disasters create income shocks and affect((/ul)) Gross Domestic Product (((ul))GDP) growth((/ul)) of affected countries, ((ul))but do not lead to conflict outbreaks directly or indirectly((/ul)). Many studies result in counterclaims by other scholars, with the ensuing debates often centering on data and methods. For example, when Burke et al. (2009) claimed that Sub-Saharan African temperature increases contributed to conflict outbreak in the region, Buhaug (2010) questioned the veracity of such claims given the restricted time period used in the study by Burke and colleagues (the years 1981–2002), and suggested that the study used a purposefully narrow definition of conflicts, and other methodological oddities. Buhaug therefore reached an opposite conclusion: ((ul))((hl))climate change and variability are poor predictors of conflicts in Africa((/hl))((/ul)). After recalibrating their models, Burke and colleagues found that the purported relationship vanished, and accepted that their earlier results were wrong (Aldhous, 2010). In another study, Hsiang and Burke (2014: 42) examined 50 quantitative studies and found “strong support for a causal association between climatological changes and conflict across a range of geographies, a range of different time periods, a range of spatial scales and across climatic events of different duration.”This led them to presume that the ‘climate security’ was firmly based in evidence. In response, Buhaug et al. (2014) identified three challenges with the study: across-study independence, causal homogeneity and sample representativeness. They employed the same method, but were not able to replicate the original results on climate change and conflicts using the same cases used by Hsiang and Burke (2014).

As mentioned above, it may be difficult in practice to identify persons who migrate due to climate change be- cause migration decisions are typically the result of several factors((/ul)). 66 While the environment may influence migration decisions, ((ul))((hl))environmental considerations are rarely the sole factor determining the decision to migrate((/hl))((/ul)). The multi- migration to climate change.'67 Setting to the side the prevailing multi-factorial understanding of migra- tion decisions, B&B, D&G, and HEA recommend definitions intended to confine the beneficiaries of their proposals to climate refugees or climate change displaced persons.'68 ((ul))It is questionable whether the proposals' definitions would cover all people migrating because of climate change while excluding people migrating for other reasons, assuming, as the proposals must, that it is possible to identify people moving because of climate change.((/ul)) B&B propose to \"restrict the notion of climate refugees to the victims of a set of three direct, largely undisputed climate change impacts: sea-level rise, extreme weather events, and drought and water scarcity.\"' 61 9 In addition, B&B propose to differentiate the level of funding available from their Climate Refu- gee Protection and Resettlement Fund based on the extent to which the eligible impact can be causally linked with climate change. Full reimbursement would be available for the incremental costs due to sea-level rise on the basis that \"general causality with climate change is undisputed\" while only \"additional funding\" would be available for migration due to the other climate impacts on the basis that climate might be \"only one causal factor to account for environmental degradation.\"' However, if the goal is to assist climate migrants, B&B's highly specific definition of climate refugee might be under-inclusive. As D&G argue, B&B's decision to restrict eligibility to persons moving due to three types of climate impact \"does not take into account the possibility that advances in science could enable more accurate determination of which events are caused by cli- mate change.\"'' Thus B&B's restrictive list of impacts risks excluding from coverage persons who are displaced due to impacts that future science suggests are climate impacts. In addition, B&B's definition includes a number of exclusions that could be questioned. The definition excludes persons who migrate for reasons that B&B deem indirectly related to climate change, \"such as international or na- tional conflicts over diminishing natural resources.\"'172 For example, while B&B would cover refugees from drought, they would not cover persons who flee conflicts triggered by the same drought.173 B&B also would exclude per- sons who migrate due to efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change, such 1 74 as the building of dams or planting of \"biofuels crops.\"' There is a smaller risk that B&B's definition also could be over-inclusive. Future science might suggest that components of the three types of impacts that B&B would cover should not be attributed to climate change. Also, as B&B acknowledge, extreme weather events, drought, and water scarcity generally may be linked to climate change, but climate change also might be only one factor contributing to them. B&B's effort to address this multi-causality by limiting the funding for migration due to these environmental impacts to \"addi- tional\" funding begs the question of how the Climate Refugee and Resettle- ment Fund would ensure it reimburses only for the portion attributable to climate change.'75 If the Fund paid for more than the migration due to climate- related drought damage, it would overpay in B&B's terms. Conversely, it would underpay if it paid for less than the migration due to climate-related drought. D&G limit the beneficiaries of their proposal by defining a \"climate change refugee as an individual who is forced to flee his or her home and to relocate temporarily or permanently across a national boundary as the resultof a sudden or gradual environmental disruption that is consistent with climate change and to which humans more likely than not contributed.\"176 D&G envis- age that a \"body of scientific experts\" created by their proposed convention would define the disruptions that the convention would cover and periodically review whether disruptions should be incorporated into or removed from the 177 eligible list. HEA largely follow D&G in attempting to circumscribe the beneficiaries of their proposal by limiting them to persons moving due to events that are \"consistent with climate change and to which humans very likely contributed,\" rather than itemizing a list of covered climate change impacts. 78 However, HEA argue that their \"'very likely' standard\" would make it harder than D&G's \"'more likely than not' standard\" to gain coverage, and accordingly their standard would better target resources to assist persons moving due to assist policymakers in applying the definition. Is0 The open-endedness of the definitions of D&G and HEA may detract from their efforts to assist climate migrants but only such migrants. D&G and HEA emphasize that the IPCC has been able to identify impacts \"as 'consistent with\"' climate change.\"'1 They also are confident in the ability of science to indicate whether environmental disruptions consistent with climate change are related to human actions, based again on the work of the IPCC.82 However, in characterizing a type of disruption as consistent with climate change or related to human activity, scientists will likely be making judgments amid uncertainty. Moreover, ((ul))they presumably will be doing so with the knowledge that their characterizations of disruptions may influence policymakers' determinations about eligibility for protection under the climate migration instrument((/ul)).\" 3 If the scientists are apt to err on the side of over-inclusion in the face of uncertainty, eligibility might be extended beyond the limits that D&G and HEA envisage. On the other hand, if the scientists are inclined to err on the side of under- inclusion in the face of uncertainty, eligibility might be overly constrained. The ((ul))open-ended definitions((/ul)) of D&G and HEA ((ul))carry the danger of de facto delegating their conventions' breadth of coverage to a body of scientists((/ul)).

His constituency is largely evangelical Christian, reliably conservative and shares a lot in common with the American voters who made Trump((ul)) president((/ul)). (Falk declined to be interviewed for this story.)","In fact, ((ul))((hl))Canadian conservatives in general tended to welcome Trump’s win((/hl))((/ul)). ((ul))An ((/ul))((ul))Ekos((/ul))((ul)) Research poll((/ul)), which happened to be released on the day Falk rose in the House, found that ((ul))while only 30 per cent of Canadians approved of Trump, fully 57 per cent of declared Conservative supporters viewed the new president ((/ul))((ul))favourably((/ul)).","((ul))The populist energy stored in that reservoir of pro-Trump sentiment ((/ul))((ul))has to((/ul))((ul)) be taken seriously by Canadian Conservatives((/ul)), especially those now vying for the federal party’s leadership. From the Liberal perspective, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has lately reafﬁrmed his old warning of a populist backlash unless government policy reduces economic inequality. And, further left, MP Charlie Angus launched a bid for the NDP leadership last month by urging his party to redeﬁne itself in opposition to Trump-style populism.","All this attention to populism takes on a real-world urgency in light of what’s been happening—among other places on the Canada-U.S. border—along that stretch of the 49th parallel separating Manitoba from Minnesota, mentioned in the House by Falk. ((ul))It’s there, as most Canadians have heard in news reports, that undocumented migrants have been crossing by the dozen—often trekking for hours across snowy ﬁelds in bitter cold—to leave Trump’s America((/ul)) behind and take their chances with Canada’s refugee process, maybe after warming up ﬁrst over coffee at Little Jay’s Café in Emerson, Man. (pop. 700).","((ul))The prospect of a growing number of asylum-seekers slipping into Manitoba((/ul))—and Quebec and British Columbia—is shaping up as an early test of Canada’s mood in the Trump era. Will the phenomenon ultimately beneﬁt the Liberals, highlighting again Trudeau’s welcoming embrace of newcomers? Or will a perceived challenge the migrants pose to law and order reward a sterner rhetorical response from Conservatives, as it has in the U.S. and Europe, ((ul))and help spark what is routinely labelled a “populist” upsurge on the right?((/ul))","Exactly what’s meant by populist isn’t always easy to pin down. Broadly speaking, though, the term is used most often these days to capture what happens when politicians on the right tap anxieties over mass migrations, linking those fears with underlying discontent over scarce jobs and stagnant wages for less-educated workers. In other words, populism means Trump’s rise in the U.S., the Brexit referendum vote to pull Britain out of the European Union and the serious challenges various right-wing parties pose in a string of European elections set for this year.","Could that same recipe be cooked up in Canada? ((ul))((hl))Trudeau’s election triumph in 2015, followed by his celebrated welcome of more than 40,000 Syrian refugees in 2016, had many observers portraying Canada as almost uniquely immune((/hl))((/ul)) to the inward-turning instinct behind Trump and Brexit.","Yet Frank Graves, the veteran Ekos pollster, has tracked and quantiﬁed similar strong currents coursing through Canadian conservatism. “((ul))The idea that a populist leader couldn’t win in Canada, that we couldn’t have an analogue to Trump, is I think nonsense((/ul)),” Graves says.","His public opinion research shows pessimism about the economic outlook and misgivings about diversity. For instance, Ekos polling found ((ul))back in 1995 that 81 per cent of Canadians agreed that “cultural diversity”((/ul)) contributed positively to Canadian identity. Asked the same question ((ul))early last year, only 66 per cent rated diversity as having a positive impact((/ul)).","Then there’s economic unease. According to Ekos, the percentage of Canadians who view themselves as middle-class has plummeted from nearly 70 per cent around 2002 to below 50 per cent last year. ((ul))((hl))Few((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) adult ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Canadians think the next generation will fare better economically than theirs has((/hl))((/ul)). And presented with the statement “((ul))If the current patterns of stagnation among all except those at the very top continue, I would not be surprised to see the emergence of violent class conﬂicts((/ul)),” Ekos found that 57 per cent of Canadians agreed.","Combine hopelessness about economic prospects with a magniﬁed sense of the risks out there in the world, and Graves says ((ul))((hl))the result is, among some Canadians, a growing hankering for more order—even a tendency to accept authoritarianism((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).((/hl))","“That type of outlook is much more receptive to the idea that we need a strongman who’s going to make decisive government actions to deal with this,” he says. “So he’s going to build a wall, or he’s going to deport illegal immigrants, or he’s going to bomb enemies.”","Graves is careful to stress that being primed to accept right-wing populist messages isn’t a majority mindset in Canada. These tendencies are, not surprisingly, by far most pronounced among avowed Conservative voters, and particularly in places like Alberta. Which raises the question of how the Conservative party—and its 14 aspiring leaders—might adjust in the Trump era.","Other researchers also point to Canadian attitudes that appear receptive to a Trump-like message. For a recent McGill Institute for the Study of Canada conference in Montreal, University of Toronto political science professor Michael Donnelly analyzed an online survey of 1,522 Canadians conducted by the polling ﬁrm Ipsos and found scant evidence that Canada is particularly big-hearted when it comes to outsiders who want in.","Donnelly reported that ((ul))when Canadians were asked how much they agree or disagree with the statement “The government should be generous in judging people’s applications for refugee status,” their tendency to be generous ranked a middling ninth out of 22 countries((/ul)). Canadian generosity only outranked Britain’s by a notch, and was just modestly ahead of Germany—both countries widely regarded as having struggled to accept immigrants. “((ul))Whatever is driving Canada’s exceptionally positive history of immigration and integration over the past half century((/ul)),” Donnelly concluded, “((ul))((hl))it does not appear to be an exceptionally tolerant public((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).”((/hl))","Note that he didn’t say, however, that Canada’s world-famous reputation for integrating newcomers is undeserved—only that it can’t be chalked up mainly to national niceness. Perhaps ((ul))the most persuasive case for why Canada really does better than the U.S. and most European countries when it comes to fostering diversity has come from researchers who focus not on Canadians’ attitudes, but on Canada’s immigration policies and the political system((/ul)).","It starts with the demographic clout of Canada’s foreign-born voters. They made up 20.6 per cent of the total population in the 2011 census, the highest proportion among the G8 countries, far higher than the roughly 13 per cent in both the U.S. and Germany. It also matters that the vast majority of Canadian immigrants choose to live in big cities in Ontario, B.C., Quebec and Alberta.","University of Toronto political science professor Phil Triadaﬁlopoulos stresses how immigrants to Canada become voting citizens more quickly than in other Western democracies, and how potent their votes have become in Canadian elections. “They don’t remain outsiders,” Triadaﬁlopoulos says. “Politically, they become insiders very quickly.”","In an inﬂuential 2013 paper entitled “Immigration, Citizenship and Canada’s New Conservative Party,” Triadaﬁlopoulos and two co-authors, McMaster University’s Inder Marwah and Carleton University’s Stephen White, note that 84 per cent of eligible immigrants in Canada become citizens, compared to just 75 per cent in Australia, 56 per cent in Britain, and a mere 40 per cent in the U.S.","((ul))They emphasize research showing that voting among immigrant Canadians roughly matches turnout rates among native-born Canadians, and((/ul)) that ((ul))immigrants are more likely than voters born here to pay attention to election news, including watching televised leaders’ debates((/ul)).","Even more crucially, ((ul))immigrants in Canada tend to cluster((/ul))((ul))﻿﻿((/ul))((ul)) in Toronto and Vancouver((/ul)), in what most political party election strategists view as key ridings. “((ul))To alienate large numbers of immigrant voters in dozens of federal ridings would almost certainly mean surrendering those ridings to other parties((/ul)),” Triadaﬁlopoulos, Marwah and White write.","Still, they point to ((ul))“grassroots conservative opinion” that often seems resistant to high levels of immigration and policies promoting multiculturalism((/ul)). That leads to what Triadaﬁlopoulos, Marwah and White dub a “populist’s paradox” facing right-of-centre Canadian political leaders, who must ﬁnd ways to speak to their base while also broadening their “ethnic” appeal.","It’s a dilemma that’s familiar to Preston Manning. He remembers coping with anti-immigrant bigots when he was leader of the upstart Reform party in the 1990s. “We had wild meetings,” Manning recalled in a recent interview. “Our ﬁrst week in the ’97 campaign, we had ‘Let the People Speak.’ It was like Russian roulette. I would get up there and say, ‘Rather than us telling you what this election is about, you’re going to tell us what it’s about.’ There would be some good, ordinary people, but there would always be some nutcase who’d get up.”","Manning says he would try to politely disavow the nutcase’s anti-immigrant (or sometimes anti-Quebec) ideas without denouncing the individual. He now heads the Calgary-based Manning Centre, which trains Conservative political operatives, conducts research and holds a key annual gathering of the Canadian right in Ottawa.","At this year’s conference, held in late February, Manning urged Conservatives to try to harness the energy of Trump-era populism, rather than only “denounce and decry” its dark side. Talking of grassroots Conservatives who worry that multiculturalism and immigration threaten “Canada’s national values and identity,” Manning advised against “contemptuously dismissing [their] concerns.”","But ((ul))allowing anti-immigrant views any room to breathe has proven strategically risky((/ul)). Former Tory prime minister Stephen Harper laboured hard to make inroads among immigrant voters, relying largely on tireless outreach efforts by Jason Kenney (who has left federal politics and is now seeking the Alberta Progressive Conservative leadership). It paid off big in the Conservatives’ 2011 majority election win, which netted the Tories 32 of 47 seats in Toronto and its suburbs, where immigrants made up about half the population.","Then came the 2015 election reversal. Facing Trudeau’s challenge, the Conservatives stoked the part of their base that was alarmed by Islamic extremism or fundamentalism by proposing a ban on face veils during citizenship ceremonies, which Harper even said he would consider broadening to the federal public service. The Conservatives would also strip the Canadian citizenship of dual nationals convicted of terrorist offences and set up a “barbaric practices tip line.”","Chris Alexander, the former Conservative immigration minister who lost his Toronto-area seat in the 2015 election, later admitted that non-Muslim immigrant communities he didn’t anticipate would feel directly threatened by these controversial policies found them deeply unsettling. Those immigrant-heavy ridings swung almost entirely back to the Liberals.","“It was clear to me, and it’s even clearer in retrospect, that ((ul))in urban Canada we were already in danger of being perceived as somehow an unwelcoming party((/ul)),” Alexander, who is now running for the federal Tory leadership, said in an interview. “That was, in my view, undeserved. But in political terms, it was a disaster.”","Are Conservatives inclined to ﬂirt with the same disaster again? Among the federal party’s 14 current leadership aspirants, Kellie Leitch, who proposes subjecting would-be immigrants to a Canadian “values test,” is clearly taking that gamble. She seems to be an outlier, though. Kevin O’Leary, seen by many as the race’s front-runner—and whose business and reality-TV resumé, and promises to slash taxes, invite Trump comparisons—shows zero inclination to mimic the president’s identity-politics blustering.","Tom Flanagan, a University of Calgary professor emeritus of political science and former Reform and Conservative campaign manager, says the Canadian way of selecting party leaders would likely frustrate an insurgency like Trump’s anyway. The U.S. primary system allows any American to vote for presidential nominees, so Trump was able to court votes from a broad, disaffected public. Canada’s next Conservative leader will be picked only by paid-up party members, which Flanagan says is a harder group for a risk-taking populist outsider to win over.","In any case, there’s just no Tory leadership aspirant who has the makings of a Canadian version of the current occupant of the White House. “Kellie Leitch is a very pallid imitation of Trump,” Flanagan says. “Kevin O’Leary isn’t even interested in the same kind of issues.”","If the Canadian election map makes taking an anti-immigrant line a losing proposition, and the Canadian way of choosing party leaders makes it hard for a populist outsider to win, there’s still the possibility that the Conservatives might try to activate the economic side of populism.","Even there, ((ul))though, the formula behind Trump and Brexit doesn’t look like a natural ﬁt in Canada((/ul)). ((ul))Trump blended his anti-immigrant rhetoric with promises to scrap or overhaul free-trade agreements. The Brexit forces linked discomfort with foreigners to resentment of the EU free-trading order((/ul)). But in Canada, liberalized trade enjoys broad buy-in—particularly on the political right, and notably in the Conservatives’ resource-exporting western strongholds.","So echoing Trump and the Brexiters in railing against unfair foreign competition is a non-starter for Canadian Conservatives. That leaves, perhaps, ﬁnding a way to give voice to the anxieties of that broad swath of Canadians who, as Graves portrays them, fear that the middle class is shrinking and that opportunities for their children and grandchildren are dwindling.","But the Tories would ﬁnd themselves playing catch-up with the Liberals when it comes to tailoring a populist message for those worried voters. Trudeau has been arguing since 2014 that failure to push income growth down from high-earners to middle-class families would eventually prompt a dangerous backlash. His answer, or at least part of it, came in last year’s budget, in the forms of a modest middle-income tax cut, an upper-income tax hike and a signiﬁcant boost in federal payments to parents.","Is more policy in the same vein coming in next month’s 2017 budget? In a signiﬁcant recent speech in Germany, at Hamburg’s annual St. Matthew’s Day Banquet, Trudeau strongly suggested he isn’t done trying salve that middle-class sense of grievance. “With the pace of globalization and technological change,” he said, “there is a very real fear out there that our kids will be worse off than we are.”","Adopting his own version of the populist line, Trudeau took direct aim at corporations that post record proﬁts but somehow can’t afford to offer job security to their workers. “Increasing inequality has made citizens distrust their governments, distrust their employers,” he added. “It turns into ‘us vs. them.’ ”","From the sounds of his Hamburg speech, Trudeau doesn’t intend to leave the next Conservative leader any easy opening to outdo him when it comes to giving voice to the disquiet of Canadians who believe the economic order is stacked against their families. It remains to be seen what additional policies the Liberals unveil in the upcoming budget to back up that rhetoric.","If Trudeau fails to deliver, a right-leaning populist might seize the chance to try to ﬁll the vacuum. Overall, though, ((ul))the prospects for a right-of-((/ul))((ul))centre((/ul))((ul)) populist movement in Canada look dim((/ul)), even though opinion in Canada, according to pollsters like Graves and academics like Donnelly, contains plenty of the same mix of fear and pessimism that fuelled Trump and Brexit.","There’s no shortage of Canadians who, if they’d heard Ted Falk wishing God’s blessing for Donald Trump, might well have said, “Amen.” ((ul))But if they’re hoping that Trump-style populism will slip across the border and succeed in Canadian politics, they’re likely to discover that Canada’s welcoming reputation has its limits((/ul))."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":76}},{"tag":"((ul))Canada’s refugee policy explicitly excludes climate refugees – they wouldn’t go to Canada anyways absent the plan((/ul))","cite":"Musampa ’17 – November 17, 2017, Benjamin Musampa holds an MA in International Law and International Politics from Universite de Sherbrooke, “How will Canada handle climate refugees?” https://cusjc.ca/bootcamp/o-zone/how-will-canada-handle-climate-refugees/ // shurst ","text":["((ul))Abdul Kadir arrived in Canada((/ul)) in 2007 after spending three years in a Kenyan refugee camp.

The ministries of forestry, livestock, health and social services have all been reported as corrupt and dysfunctional. Because these institutions are ill-equipped to tackle Somalia’s chronic vulnerabilities to floods, droughts and food insecurity, many citizens find themselves without clean water and other vital resources. Luisa Veronis, an associate professor at the University of Ottawa, has studied the environmental influences on African migration to Canada. She said that the depletion of Somalia’s natural resources as a result of climate change and political conflict is worse than in any other African country. University of Ottawa professor Luisa Veronis addresses environmental issues in immigration policy Somali participants in her study identified deforestation as a major environmental concern in their home country. Wood is needed for cooking and for charcoal production, and deforestation has led to competition between pastoralists attempting to grab any remaining vegetation to feed their animals during droughts. Often Somalis have no choice but to abandon everything and escape these precarious conditions, hoping to reach one of the refugee camps located in neighbouring countries like Kenya. “While living in a refugee camp in Kenya, life was harsh, very hard, no water, no shelter, no sanitations,” Kadir recalled. Kadir was very happy to begin his new life in Canada after he was accepted as a political refugee. He quickly found a well-established Somali community in the Ottawa-Gatineau region. Somalis are the largest community among African-descent immigrants living in Ottawa with 11,000 people. But not all those seeking to escape Somalia will have a chance to settle in Canada. Earlier this month, ((ul))((hl))the Canadian government unveiled a new immigration plan which aims to bring in an additional one million people over the next three years.

Several euro countries that used to have gaping external deficits now run current-account surpluses.

((ul))Progress has also been notable in the area of debt. Debt ratios have declined for governments, private households and non-financial enterprises((/ul)) – although the absolute stock of debt remains very high. On the other hand, our ratings are abysmal when it comes to unemployment, which still stands at 11.6% across the eurozone. We also worry about the fact that eurozone exports, on average, are not gaining global market shares. This is a reminder that measures of economic stability can differ markedly from those of economic dynamism. While the eurozone as a whole looks more resilient, there are, of course, big differences between the member countries. There is still a noticeable split between what economists have come to refer to as the core and the periphery of the eurozone. Austria, Germany, Luxembourg, Estonia and Latvia look very balanced. They tend to have stable public finances, low private debt, few external imbalances and they mostly manage to defend their shares in global markets. The (former) program countries, Greece, Portugal, Spain and Ireland, all have some way to catch up. Greece still brings up the rear in our ranking (only Cyprus scores even worse). Greece has cut its budget deficit and regained competitiveness, but it remains vulnerable because of its mountainous debts, mass unemployment and rigid labor and product markets. Although other peripheral countries are on the right track, they still have their own problems. Portugal, for example, is struggling with the highest interest rate burden in the eurozone, while Spain’s unemployment rate is still 24%. Both factors make it harder to get debt and deficits under control. Fiscal policy is also Italy’s Achilles’ heel. Public debt stands at over 130% of GDP and although the Italian government borrows more cheaply these days than the US Treasury, this might leave the country vulnerable to a sudden deterioration in market sentiment. Italy’s debt burden looks particularly daunting, given its low scores on employment, productivity and competitiveness. Although France’s economic malaise has been much discussed, in terms of economic stability, the country ranks in mid-field – disappointing but not overly vulnerable. Fiscal indicators look steady but have not improved. France’s ongoing loss of world market share stores up trouble for the future.

In this atmosphere, media pundits are asking whether it is possible that Tehran and Riyadh may enter direct military confrontation. The answer is clear: ((ul))((hl))There will not be a war((/hl))((/ul)) between Iran and Saudi Arabia, for five main reasons. ((ul))((hl))First, the administration of Iran((/hl))((/ul))ian President Hassan Rouhani ((ul))is ((/ul))((ul))((hl))pursuing a policy of constructive engagement with the world((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))— which is what Iranians elected him for in 2013. In Iran’s complicated political system, the executive and legislative branches are elected by popular vote, though the Guardian Council’s vetting of candidates makes the elections process not entirely free. Within this political system, making a decision to engage in war is not an easy task. Therefore, while some Saudi leaders may beat the drums of escalation, ((ul))((hl))the possibility of outright war depends on factors such as whether there is political will for such action and how((/hl))((/ul)) the two ((ul))((hl))countries choose to handle the crisis in their relations. In sum, engaging in war is not something that can be done by one side alone((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) Moreover, Iran’s government has no incentive to increase tensions, as evidenced by the condemnation of the attack on the Saudi Embassy in Tehran by the triangle of power in Iranian foreign policy, meaning Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Rouhani and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. In a goodwill effort, Iran has also announced that it will continue to send pilgrims to Saudi Arabia for the hajj this year. Thus, if Saudi Arabia intends to initiate war, the Iranian public — seeing themselves as victims of a violation — will mobilize, and also gain the sympathy of the international community. ((ul))Second, ((/ul))((ul))the majority of((/ul)) Iran’s ((ul))current leaders were involved in the destructive war with Iraq and are fully aware of its costs. ((/ul))Rouhani held several military positions during the conflict, while Zarif and his deputies also remember the hardships of that era in their capacity as diplomats. Khamenei, who was president at that time, also served as chairman of the Supreme Defense Council, while Rafsanjani served as the de facto commander-in-chief of the Iranian military. Even Iran’s parliament speaker, Ali Larijani, served as a commander with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Larijani’s brothers, including incumbent judiciary chief Sadegh Larijani, were also involved in the conflict. Many other influential Iranian figures, including a great number of parliamentarians and Friday prayer leaders, also have bitter memories of war, some of them as war veterans. Moreover, although the IRGC at times seems to favor showdowns — such as in the cases of the recent detention of US sailors or its surveillance of the aircraft carrier USS Harry Truman in the Persian Gulf — it is not empowered to take arbitrary actions. ((ul))Third, the very nature of the current crisis makes war unlikely.((/ul)) According to Charles Hermann, a renowned analyst of issues related to US foreign policy, crisis management and decision-making, ((ul))what defines a crisis are the three elements of threat, time and surprise. Whether the situation threatens the vital interests of a state allows only a short time for decision-making, and whether it occurs as a surprise to policymakers must all be considered. When it comes to Iran and Saudi Arabia, the nature of their crisis does not meet ((/ul))((ul))this criteria((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) In fact, Saudi Arabia’s tone against Iran has even softened in recent weeks. Indeed, Saudi Deputy Crown Prince and Minister of Defense Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud recently told The Economist, “Whoever is pushing toward [war with Iran] is somebody who is not in their right mind.” Fourth, on the international level, Saudi Arabia believes that in the event of a military confrontation with Iran, the United States and the rest of the West may side with the Islamic Republic. Riyadh’s decision to cut ties with Tehran has received virtually no international support aside from some African countries that play no significant role in international power equations. Even US Secretary of State John Kerry has urged calm following the breakdown in the Saudi-Iranian relationship. There may have been a time when, because of Saudi Arabia’s oil or its position, Washington would have gone out of its way to serve the interests of Riyadh. However, now, even some US elites view Saudi Arabia as a slightly more civilized version of the Islamic State. ((ul))Last but not least((/ul))((ul)), victory is uncertain((/ul)) in a potential Iranian-Saudi war. Saudi Arabia and Iran may take destructive blows from each other, but ((ul))both know that neither ((/ul))((ul))has the ability to((/ul))((ul)) destroy the other side or impose regime change.((/ul)) Saudi Arabia has more warplanes and modern military equipment, while Iran has better missile capabilities and military personnel. Riyadh’s involvement in the Yemen war is another factor that reduces the motivation for war with Tehran. Moreover, the population in Saudi Arabia’s oil-rich Eastern Province is mainly Shiite and has the potential to revolt — an advantage for Tehran that Riyadh cannot easily create for itself in Iran. Lastly, Iran’s control of the Strait of Hormuz, through which Saudi Arabia conducts much of its trade, is a further preventative factor, since war would necessitate redirecting all that trade to the Red Sea, which in the short run is just not possible."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":65}},{"tag":"Water scarcity makes violence and instability inevitable","cite":"Ahmed 15- Nafeez, bestselling author, investigative journalist and international security scholar, New Age Of Water Wars Portends ‘Bleak Future’ For The Middle East, (http://www.mintpressnews.com/new-age-of-water-wars-portends-bleak-future-for-the-middle-east/203712/) JB","text":["((ul))((hl))Behind the escalating violence in Iraq, Syria and Yemen, as well as the epidemic of civil unrest across the wider region, is a growing shortage of water.

Washington collects allies like most people collect Facebook \"friends.\" ((ul))The vast majority of((/ul))((ul)) U.S. allies are security ((/ul))((ul))liabilities((/ul))((ul)), tripwires for conflict and war((/ul)). Perhaps even worse, American officials constantly abase themselves, determined to reassure the very countries which the U.S. is defending at great cost and risk. Indeed, America's most hawkish politicians, who routinely posture like reincarnations of Winston Churchill, routinely talk of sacrificing U.S. lives, wealth, and security for the benefit of other nations. For instance, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fl.) recently worried, \"What ally around the world can feel safe in their alliance with us?\" The more relevant question should be with what ally can America feel safe? Instead of relentlessly collecting more international dependents, Washington policymakers should drop Allies In Name Only (AINOs). ((ul))The U.S. should return to a more traditional standard for alliances: Join with other nations only when doing so advances American security. Alas, that ((/ul))((ul))rarely is the case today((/ul)). Indeed, contra the scare-mongering of hawkish politicians such as Sen. Rubio and his GOP compatriots, the strategic environment today is remarkably benign for the U.S. The world is messy, to be sure, but that's always been the case. ((ul))The number of big conflicts is down((/ul)). More important, ((ul))America faces no hegemonic threat or peer competitor((/ul)) and is allied with every major industrialized state other than China and Russia. ((ul))All of Washington's recent wars have been over((/ul)) -- from America's standpoint -- ((ul))unimportant, indeed, sometimes frivolous stakes. The Islamic State, Libya and Iraq were regional problems for U.S. allies with ((/ul))((ul))minimal impact on America((/ul))((ul)). Iran and North Korea are ugly actors, but mostly for Washington's dependents. The two would face ((/ul))((ul))destruction if they attacked America((/ul)). The latest crisis du jour, Yemen, worries Riyadh but is not even a speed bump for the globe's sole superpower. Yet Washington now is involved in another sectarian proxy war through its totalitarian \"ally\" Saudi Arabia. ((ul))Terrorism remains a genuine ((/ul))((ul))threat, but((/ul))((ul)) falls far short of the sort of existential danger posed by the Soviet Union((/ul)) during the Cold War. Worse, terrorism typically is a response to foreign intervention and occupation. Washington has inadvertently encouraged terrorism by backing authoritarian regimes, joining foreign conflicts, and creating enemies overseas. ((ul))((hl))America has done some of the worst damage to itself when protecting the interests of allies -- fighting their wars, killing their enemies, backing their campaigns, advancing their interests((/hl))((/ul))((hl)). ((/hl))((ul))((hl))Adding unnecessary allies obviously makes this problem worse((/hl))((/ul)). In Ukraine, for instance, the Obama administration is under pressure to treat a non-ally as an ally -- arming and/or defending Russia's neighbor -- which would yield a proxy war with Russia, a nuclear-armed state which considers border security a vital interest. Bringing Ukraine (and Georgia) into NATO would be even more dangerous, inviting a geopolitical game of chicken over minimal stakes. Neither country has ever been considered even a marginal security concern of America. In contrast, both were long ruled by Moscow, which sees their links to the West as a form of encirclement, capping the extension of NATO up to Russia's borders. Of course, both nations have been treated unfairly and badly by Moscow. But that doesn't justify a military alliance with the U.S. ((ul))Alliances should be based on interest, not charity((/ul)). They should not be an end, an independent security interest, but a means to an end, to protect America. Adding troubled states with limited military capabilities and unresolved conflicts turns the purpose of alliances on their head. The U.S. long eschewed alliances and other \"foreign entanglements,\" against which George Washington had warned. Even in World War I, a foolish imperial slugfest of no concern to America, Woodrow Wilson brought in the U.S. only as an \"associated power.\" Popular and congressional opposition then prevented Wilson from guaranteeing the allied powers' post-war territorial seizures. Nevertheless, Washington's involvement was a catastrophic mistake, making possible the Versailles Treaty, which turned out to be only a generational truce before the combatants returned to fight a second and far bloodier round. The extraordinary circumstances of World War II led to a genuine and justifiable alliance. During the Cold War the U.S. created what were intended to be temporary alliances. This policy was justified by the vulnerability of America's war-ravaged friends and hostility of the great communist powers, China and the Soviet Union. But even Dwight Eisenhower warned against turning the Europeans into permanent dependents. It makes no sense for Washington to retain responsibility for defending a continent with a larger economy and population than America -- and vastly greater resources than its only serious potential threat, Russia. Much the same has happened in Asia, which Washington filled with allies after World War II. Even as Japan became the world's second economic power Tokyo relied on the American military. South Korea now has 40 times the GDP and twice the population of the North, yet Washington is responsible for the South's defense. The problem is not just wasted resources, but tripwires for war. Alliances deter, but they also ensure involvement if deterrence fails, as it often does. And lending smaller states the services of a superpower's military changes their behavior, causing them to be more confrontational, even reckless. America and China aren't likely to come to blows over, say, Hawaii, which Beijing has no intention of attacking. But conflict could erupt over irrelevant allied territorial disputes, such as the Senkaku Islands and Scarborough Reef, claimed by Japan and the Philippines, respectively, and China. Unfortunately, commitments to marginal allies determine basic U.S. defense strategy. Should America be prepared to fight one, one and a half, two, or more wars at once? These prospective conflicts invariably involve allies, not America directly. After all, what state can actually harm the U.S.? Other than Russia (and to a much more limited degree China) with its ICBMs, there is none. If war comes, it will involve Korea, Japan, the Persian Gulf, or Europe. The greater the number of dependent allies, the larger the number of possible wars. But when the interests involved are unimportant and the nations involved are capable of defending themselves, why is Washington sacrificing its people's lives and wealth for other states? The U.S. should start defenestrating AINOs. Most of these nations would remain close. With all of them commerce should be free, culture should be shared, people should be friends, and governments should cooperate. In some cases military coordination may be called for, when the U.S. and other nations share vital objectives. However, Washington should stop defending South Korea. With an overwhelming resource advantage, the South should deter North Korean adventurism and build cooperative regional relationships to preserve security in Northeast Asia. Despite historic tensions, Seoul should build ties with Japan, another American dependent which should transcend the past and create a military sufficient constrain a growing China. Washington should base relationships on equality rather than dependence. ((ul))The U.S. also should end its European defense dole. Today, NATO is effectively North America and the Others. Yet the Europeans collectively are wealthier and more populous than the U.S. They should ((/ul))((ul))take over NATO((/ul))((ul)) or set up their own alliance((/ul)). No doubt there still would be important occasions for Washington to work militarily with these nations, which share history and values.

The new policy companion statement addresses the need to grow a STEM-capable U.S. workforce that leverages the talents of people at all education levels and in all sectors. It not only includes traditional scientists and engineers performing research in university, government, or industry labs, but also “skilled technical workers” who can install, repair, debug, and build, but do not have a four-year degree. This skilled technical workforce includes a large, diverse group of workers that are crucial components of almost every sector of the U.S. economy, from “blue collar” occupations--such as installation, maintenance, and repair--to healthcare and computer jobs. In the early 1990s, the National Science Foundation (NSF) created the Advanced Technological Education program (ATE) targeted at strengthening the skilled technical workforce. To date, the program has awarded more than $950 million to 492 distinct institutions, with more than 65 percent of the awards going to two-year degree granting institutions. In 2016, recognizing the need to enhance U.S. leadership in science and engineering discovery, NSF launched the Inclusion across the Nation of Communities of Learners of Underrepresented Discoverers in Engineering and Science (INCLUDES) program.

I basically believe that as long as the Pentagon is still buying two manned fighter planes after the unmanned revolution, there is more than enough money going to the Defense Department—because if money were really tight, one or both of those programs would be cancelled, and the military services would be undercutting each other's budgets to increase the funding available for their priorities. As long as adaptation to obvious next-generation platforms (like unmanned aerial fighters) remains this slow and the services placidly accept their budget shares, the topline is adequate. But even ((ul))I am now nervous about the widening gap between America’s military obligations and the resourcing we are committing. What’s worsening the situation is that the Trump administration is both expanding requirements and contracting spending.((/ul)) Since taking office, President Trump and his defense secretary have approved an increase in both forces and operational tempo in the fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria; committed to an enduring presence in Iraq after the defeat of ISIS; are considering an imminent increase of at least 4,000 troops to Afghanistan as part of the advise and assist mission to Afghan National Security Forces; are reviewing an Afghan war strategy that could make weightier demands of long duration to that country; have increased the military assets assigned to deter and if necessary engage North Korea; are providing greater intelligence and special-operations support to allied operations in Yemen; and are pushing back assertively on Iranian naval activity. Those are non-trivial expansions of demand to place on an already over-stretched force. Chief of Staff of the Army, General Mark Milley, assesses current requirements at 540,000 active-duty soldiers, which appears to be the Army’s favorite round number: It was also what the Army believed it needed in the mid-1990s, and what the Army believed it needed mid-term of the Obama administration. So it’s likely an institutionally comfortable number rather than a rigorously derived one. Still, the 540,000 number cannot reasonably meet the very different demands of those three time frames. Planners at the end of the Cold War envisioned a strategic environment that entailed Russia integrating into the West, did not imagine the emergence of global terrorist threats, and under-emphasized the rise of an aggressive China as America’s peer. The early-2000s assessments were based on a Russia reset, the tide of wars receding, and China as a responsible stakeholder; none of those three planning parameters hold. Even without factoring in the president’s policies, objectively the international environment is increasing demands. ((ul))The president’s budget allots only a 3-percent increase in the coming fiscal year DOD spending.((/ul)) When out-year projections are taken into account, the Trump budget will add only $463-billion increase through 2027. ((ul))Despite political grandstanding about the “historic” size of the increase and a pledge to rebuild America’s armed forces, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))that is a very modest bump, probably inadequate even to rebuild current readiness shortfalls((/hl))((/ul)). Moreover, the Trump budget would drastically reduce the congressionally-approved slush fund called Overseas Contingency Operations. The OCO funds are off-budget, so are unconstrained by the Budget Control Act ceilings, and currently funnel an additional $64 billion to Defense. Despite Defense Secretary James Mattis testifying that preserving OCO funding was one of his top five budget priorities, the president’s budget would reduce the funding to only $12 billion by the end of the five-year Future Years Defense Program. To make matters worse, the president has offered up a budget there is no reasonable possibility the Congress will enact, because it both exceeds BCA caps by $52 billion and pays for the modest increase in defense spending by violating the mandated dollar for dollar balance between domestic and defense spending. The former chair of the House Appropriations Committee, Republican Hal Rodgers, called it “politically impossible.” Mattis testified that his own budget fails to fund $33 billion in needed spending. One bleak interpretation of the White House’s intention is that the administration is seeking to make it safe for Republicans to vote in favor of budgets that increase deficit spending. Under this theory, in order to get increases in defense, conservatives would swallow their concern about the debt and agree to increases in domestic spending. In short, the administration would be betting on budget hawks abjuring their principles.

The Bush and the Obama administrations prioritized America’s outreach to India and negotiated key agreements in trade and nuclear and military cooperation. Now, ((ul))the challenge is to build on this important bipartisan achievement ((/ul))((ul))to create an even closer U.S.–India relationship((/ul)). Closer economic ties. Trade has transformed U.S.–India relations. “Bilateral trade has more than doubled in the last decade from $45 billion in 2006 to more than $114 billion in 2016,” as the State Department’s Alice Wells recently told Congress. In 2014, President Obama and Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged to increase U.S.–India trade fivefold, and in the past two years, U.S. foreign direct investment in India has grown 500 percent. However, ((ul))U.S.–India trade remains far short of its full potential((/ul)). The president promised in his State of the Union address Tuesday that “we will work to fix bad trade deals and negotiate new ones.” If he is serious, ((ul))((hl))the president should negotiate a bilateral investment treaty to further promote U.S.–India trade((/hl))((/ul)). For comparison: Joshua Meltzer and Harsha Singh of the Brookings Institution note that trade between America and South Korea is twice as large as that between America and India, even though South Korea’s economy is 40 percent smaller than India’s. ((ul))Another vital step for the administration is to support India’s effort to join the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC).((/ul)) India has sought to join APEC for more than 20 years, and in 2010 the organization lifted a moratorium on new members. Despite this, Washington has not seized the opportunity to support New Delhi. “((ul))India in APEC would help offset the now overwhelming influence of the Chinese economy,”((/ul)) writes Alyssa Ayres of the Council on Foreign Relations, “((ul))while also embedding India in a forum that would nudge it toward further economic reform.((/ul))” For his part, Prime Minister Modi took office in 2014 promising ambitious economic reforms. He quickly unveiled his “Make in India” initiative to boost the country’s manufacturing sector from 17 percent of the country’s GDP to 25 percent over the next decade. Recently, India introduced a goods and services tax to replacing existing state and local levies in favor of a common national tax. Overall, however, Modi’s policies have fallen fall short of his promises. As the 2019 Indian election approaches, he should not shy away from pursuing dramatic structural reforms. Derek Scissors of the American Enterprise Institute recommends allowing Indian manufacturers to hire more people, privatizing banks, improving market access, and permitting full private ownership of land. Indeed, while India is expected to become the world’s fifth-largest economy this year, there is still much New Delhi can do to promote economic growth. As Wells noted, India still has “significant tariff and non-tariff barriers, subsidies, localization policies, restrictions on investment, and intellectual property concerns that limit market access and impede U.S. exporters and businesses from entering the Indian market.” The Commerce Department reports that India has levied an array of tariffs on U.S. goods such as medical equipment, automobiles and motorcycles, rubber, alcoholic beverages, and textiles. What makes this particularly frustrating is that “India has considerable flexibility to change tariff rates at any time,” leaving U.S. exporters with tremendous uncertainty. If U.S.–India trade is to meet its full potential, then the relationship needs to be rooted in policies that are free and fair. ((ul))Increasing military cooperation. Just as trade is bringing the United States and India together economically, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))China’s military actions are bringing them together strategically((/hl))((/ul)). Sales of U.S. military equipment to India have gone from zero to $15 billion in ten years. Already, the United States sells India transport and maritime patrol aircraft, anti-ship missiles, and helicopters. But, ((ul))with the ((/ul))((ul))declaration((/ul))((ul)) of India as a “major defense partner” in 2016, the administration can ((/ul))((ul))offer even more systems for sale((/ul))((ul)), such as drone and fighter aircraft and aircraft-carrier technologies((/ul)). Just as trade is bringing the United States and India together economically, China’s military actions are bringing them together strategically. Last fall, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson detailed the administration’s “vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific, supported and protected by two strong pillars of democracy — the United States and India.” But to achieve that aim, Washington and New Delhi must further enhance their defense cooperation. ((ul))The end goal of this cooperation((/ul)), says James Carafano of the Heritage Foundation, ((ul))is to craft a unique strategic relationship((/ul)), “one ((ul))that delivers the benefits of allied status((/ul)) without the formal architecture that goes with it.” Finally, as China’s military power grows, U.S. allies in the Pacific are increasing their security cooperation with the United States and each other. The Trump administration should help further incorporate India into this emerging quadrilateral relationship between themselves, Japan, and Australia. Washington, Ashley Tellis of the Carnegie Endowment says, should “actively encourage consultations, exercises, liaison relationships, and even defense procurement among any combination of partners within this ‘Quad.’” By working together to defend their common interests, the Quad can advance a shared vision of an Indo-Pacific that is free from coercion and intimidation. Conclusion. In 2000, Indian prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee declared that his country and the United States are “natural allies.” But, as President Trump said when unveiling his national-security strategy: “Success is not a forgone conclusion. It must be earned.” ((ul))((hl))Trump and Modi should take the difficult steps now to fulfill their predecessors’ visions of a close U.S.–Indian economic and military relationship((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul))"],"stats":{"highlightedWords":43}},{"tag":"((hl))The Republic of India should join the One Belt and One Road Initiative.((/hl))\n((hl))That would strengthen economic ties between India and Pakistan and prevent conflict.((/hl))","cite":"((hl))Maqsood, 18((/hl))","text":["(Asia, degree of M.

Pakistan plays a significant role in China’s Maritime Silk Route as part of China’s Belt and Road initiative (BRI). The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is a vital development project within China’s Belt Road Initiative (BRI) and serves as the crucial link between the maritime ‘road’ and land based ‘belt’ aspects of the BRI. India perceives China’s Maritime Silk route passing through South Asia as a direct threat to its core strategic interest in the Indian Ocean as it wants to maintain Indian primacy in the Indian Ocean (IO) and Indian Ocean Littoral States. Indian leaders have strong aspirations to be a blue water navy or the dominant naval power in the Indian Ocean since its inception in 1947. Indian Researcher Anit Mukherjee determines the Indian Ocean strategy in three categories. One is to establish closer ties with the US and its allies, second is to strengthen its links with Indian Ocean Littoral states and last is to build up its own military power (including the induction of nuclear capable submarines into the Indian Ocean). Indian Ocean Region (IOR) is the coastal area (consists of islands and states) lying in contact with the IO. It has become a renewed focal point of global economy, having substantial avenues for economic activities of Asia, US, and Europe. Therefore, all stakeholders are obliged to ensure the security of the Indian Ocean in order to avoid any miscalculation or misperception among all stake holders. Moreover, ((ul))China is expected to be the world’s largest oil importing country and India is expected to be the largest coal importing country by 2020; therefore, there is an inevitable need for their cooperative efforts to ensure security((/ul)). On the other hand, the enlargement of the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) in the IOR is primarily due to the large economic incentives. China has transported 173.9 million tons of oil from the Middle East to China, and 52.4 million tons from Africa to China in 2016. Besides, China has established its first overseas military base in Djibouti which is considered by India as part of China’s “String of Pearls” strategy and would engulf India. If India is developing its military (three wings: army, navy, air force) to maximize its power, likewise it may avoid feeding its fears related to China’s port development assistance in the IOR as China is pursuing its own national economic and strategic interests. India perceives that these ports can disrupt the refuelling of India’s tankers, warships because of the presence of People’s Liberation Army Navy in the IOR. ((ul))The contemporary world is ((/ul))((ul))globalised((/ul))((ul)) and interdependent where states ((/ul))((ul))have to((/ul))((ul)) cooperate with each other((/ul)) in each walk of life. Therefore, India’s rhetoric regarding China’s development projects may prove unjustified in the future. Here the question arises that why is India one of the biggest trade partners of China if it feels that it would be engulfed by China? By the same token, India has presuppositions that the development of Gwadar Port in Pakistan’s Balochistan Province under China — Pakistan’s joint development project, China — Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) will pave the way for the formation of Chinese naval base in Gwadar. ((ul))Fuelling((/ul))((ul)) fears against China, India has launched a nuclear capable Submarine in the Indian Ocean. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))This ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))nuclearisation((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) of Indian Ocean has serious security implications for Pakistan((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). ((/ul))Thus, Pakistan needs a strategic partner currently (in the form of China) in order to monitor India’s naval activities in the Indian Ocean. China can monitor the naval activities of both the US and India on the Indian Ocean. ((ul))The new generation of nuclear submarines may increase the risk of a devastating war between the two longstanding enemies((/ul)) Some of the recent events such as India-China military standoff at Doklam from16 June 2017 — 28 August 2017 and India-Pakistan’s blame game on the unprovoked firing on the Line of Control region in 2017 and in the beginning of 2018that left hundreds of people dead and injured, are the destabilising incidents in the South Asian region. ((ul))In ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the backdrop of these insecurities, Pakistan ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))has to((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))maximise((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) its ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))defence((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) Most recently, an embryonic formation of an alternative route against China’s B&R initiative by a quad of Australia, India, Japan and the US in order to contain China’s global influence may exacerbate some tensions at global level. India being part of this quad may pursue its strategic objective against China’s B & R initiative. India here has certain doubts about Chinese aims to deploy Gwadar in the medium to long term as a dual use port, allowing the PLA key access into the Indian Ocean as well as bolstering Pakistan’s ability to deter any Indian advantage in the naval realm. The Pakistani port of Gwadar, built, financed and operated by China is located at the union of the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea, providing China access to a key location in the Indian Ocean. In between all these states, Pakistan being an important part of China’s Belt and Road initiative can maximize it maritime security fittingly. Pakistan navy is likely to buy eight more diesel-electric attack submarines from China in near future. These are scheduled for delivery in 2028 to maximize Pakistan’s maritime security as a defensive measure. It may direct a response to India’s August 2016 deployment of its first nuclear submarine, the Arihant. A second, even more advanced Indian nuclear submarine, the Arighat, began sea trials last November, and four more boats are scheduled to join the fleet by 2025. That will give India a ‘nuclear triad,’ which means the country will have the ability to deliver a nuclear strike by land-based missiles, by warplanes, and by submarines. The submarine is the key component. It’s considered the most “survivable” in the event of a devastating first strike by an enemy, and thus able to deliver a retaliatory second strike. Lastly, ((ul))((hl))Both China and Pakistan will be able to monitor India’s naval activities in the Indian Ocean so that India’s attempt to get an advantage in the IO can be counterbalanced((/hl))((/ul)). If, supposedly, that advantage will go unnoticed, there would be more chance of the nuclearisation When it comes to India and Pakistan, by contrast, the new generation of nuclear submarines may increase the risk of a devastating war between the two longstanding enemies.

The [*PG338]restrictive Canadian treatment, balanced against the liberal American treatment, potentially exposes interested individuals (members of native groups attempting to cross the U.S-Canadian border) to wild disparities in the law.

The success of a majority of these startups heavily relies on STEM skillsets that include software/app development, data analytics and machine learning expertise, and the seamless integration of technologies that enhance user experiences. While the demand for STEM degrees continues to increase, the time needed to attain a higher education degree remains relatively constant and typically exceeds fifty-two months, well beyond the projected forty-eight months that students prefer. Several questions emerge from these findings: Is the rate of attaining a STEM degree or skillset keeping up with the evolving needs of society? Will advancements in automation and artificial intelligence reduce the demand for STEM workers? What policies should be considered to increase a nation’s competitiveness, in the age of artificial intelligence and automation?

American advances in nuclear weapons technology in the 1950s made possible the ‘first offset strategy’ nullifying the Soviet superiority in conventional numbers, and when Moscow narrowed the gap, heavy ‘second offset’ investment in emerging stealth and smart weapons technologies ensured the US lead remained through the 80s and 90s. But what of the decades since? US Secretary of Defense James Mattis, warned in his speech at John Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies on 19th January, “((ul))((hl))our competitive edge has eroded in every domain of warfare, air, land, sea, space and cyberspace, ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))and it is continuing to erode((/hl))((/ul)).” ((ul))There is a growing consensus that the once-unassailable US technological advantage is fast ((/ul))((ul))fading, and((/ul))((ul)) might even soon be ceded to one of its rivals, probably China((/ul)), in the course of renewed competition between ‘Great Powers’, the like of which the world has not seen for over half a century. On the face of it, it is hard to see why. The US has certainly not become any less innovative or technologically capable than either Russia or China; current Defense News data shows that the United States is home to no fewer than 15 of the world’s top 25 defence contractors, and according to Forbes, exactly the same holds true for technology companies too. The talent is evidently there – but this is a game as much about focus as capability, and US attention has been distracted. An era of distraction: the demands of asymmetric warfare In fairness, the Twin Towers was hardly an event to be simply ignored, but in launching its ‘War on Terror’, Washington suddenly and dramatically shifted focus onto a very different kind of adversary and the new and immediate demands of asymmetric warfare and counter-insurgency. “In launching its ‘War on Terror’, Washington shifted focus onto a very different kind of adversary.” At the same time ‘second offset’ technologies were proliferating around the world, resources that would otherwise have been allocated towards developing and cementing ‘third offset’ weapons, and capabilities to maintain military dominance, were instead expended in Iraq and Afghanistan. While the US focused on dismantling the terrorists’ networks, training camps and safe-havens, China steadily ramped up its defence investment and innovation, developing its own systems and technologies to equip its military for the 21stCentury, and potentially challenge American hegemony in the Pacific. ((ul))The irony is that, in many ways, the success of what Eisenhower dubbed the ‘military-industrial complex’((/ul)), a success that first helped the US to global pre-eminence in the first place, ((ul))has also brought about its current predicament. Could the model that seemed so right for so long, now be quite wrong?((/ul)) Consolidated dream teams and suffering competition “((ul))((hl))We cannot expect success fighting tomorrow’s conflicts with yesterday’s weapons or equipment((/hl))((/ul)),” Mattis told his audience at John Hopkins, and yet in essence that is often what the Department of Defense (DOD) does when it comes to technological innovation. The DOD development blueprint was well-honed for the era in which it was devised, but it is now increasingly beginning to look as if it has become outmoded. Big defence spending throughout the Cold War, followed by the huge consolidation of the US defence sector when both came to an end has left a legacy approach based on rigid requirements, and contracts aimed at the same small number of specialist contractors. In addition, the costs of the programmes are often so high that ‘dream teams’ of prime defence contractors, who should in theory be rivals, band together to bid for Pentagon projects. There are two big consequences. Firstly, ((ul))having spent so much on their development and procurement, the resulting systems are almost invariably forced to remain in service for many years((/ul)), albeit modified and upgraded, irrespective of changing needs and technological advances. Secondly, and ultimately more importantly, competition inevitably suffers, and without the need to compete, there is little incentive to take a risk and innovate. As Eisenhower put it in the same 1961 farewell speech that first introduced the term ‘military-industrial complex’ to the common lexicon, “a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity.” The economic paradox of the innovation deficit Economic factors play a major role too. While the US has the world’s largest defence expenditure in dollar terms, paradoxically many point to a lack of DOD spending as one of the key reasons for the nation’s growing innovation deficit. An important budgetary trend lies hidden in the high absolute numbers. ((ul))Since 2009, the US ((/ul))((ul))defence((/ul))((ul)) spend has fallen from 4.6% of GDP to just 3.3% today((/ul)), and although the latest figures from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute show that this decline has now been reversed, the fact remains that ((ul))GDP expenditure on R&D is ((/ul))((ul))less than half what it was thirty years ago.((/ul)) “Since 2009, the US defence spend has fallen from 4.6% of GDP to just 3.3% today.” For small-to-medium companies in the mid- and lower-tiers of the sector, that generates something of a crisis of commercial confidence when it comes to investing heavily in developing precisely the kinds of technologies that the Pentagon needs for the future. ((ul))The same is certainly not true in China, where innovation in the industry is booming((/ul)), creating the ideal conditions to incubate a talent pool for the future that is as competitive as it is inventive. It is hard to imagine that the two things are not related. However, it would be far too simplistic to suggest that it is simply all about government investment. If technology is to remain at the heart of the oft-quoted US ‘overmatch’, the DOD also needs to address changing marketplace realities and accept that with the huge expansion of global tech firms, defence contracts are now significantly less influential than they once were. ((ul))((hl))Putting it bluntly, ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))the Pentagon no longer has the deepest pockets in town((/hl))((/ul)). In the 2015 study ‘National Security Technology Accelerator: A Plan for Civil-Military Industry Innovation’ from New York University, the authors observed that “((ul))the emergence of international commercial and consumer high-tech markets over the past two decades has substantially displaced DOD as the ((/ul))((ul))centre((/ul))((ul)) of gravity for global R&D activity((/ul)).” It is for these markets that many of the cutting-edge technologies that the US military may one day come to depend on are being developed, not the traditional defence contract route. Reshaping relationships: Forging new commercial partnerships That does not automatically make for a tale of doom and gloom. The DOD has a long history of working successfully with the private sector, and some of today’s most profoundly important technologies, including the internet and GPS navigation, arose directly as a result, while many others have been significantly boosted by defence funded projects. Nevertheless, as Adam Jay Harrison, the National Security Technology Accelerator director, has pointed out, too many technology businesses – even some that have previously enjoyed DOD support – are now “turning their backs” on the Pentagon. The challenge is to re-forge and reshape the relationship between commercial technology companies and the military to make it fit for this century, not the last. “One path to more fully align civilian technology opportunities with the Defense enterprise is for DOD to radically rethink its approach to acquisition and industry engagement in a manner that is more consistent with commercial market norms,” the New York University study concludes. If it does not, then the risk of the US losing its long-standing innovative edge becomes very real indeed – and China is waiting."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":47}},{"tag":"((hl))The CP’s economic and military expansion is the only way to solve the advantage((/hl))","cite":"((hl))Burns, 14((/hl))","text":["(Nicholas Burns, Professor of the Practice of Diplomacy and International Politics at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government and former U.S. Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs What Washington Can Do to Revive Relations With New Delhi, Foreign Affairs, 00157120, Sep/Oct2014, Vol. 93, Issue 5)","In the century ahead, U.S. strategic interests will align more closely with India's than they will with those of any other continental power in Asia.

In the Asia-Pacific region, especially, India joins Australia, Japan, South Korea, and others in a U.S.-led coalition of democratic allies. And as the most powerful state in South Asia, India will exert a positive influence on a troubled Afghanistan, as well as on Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. The ((ul))Obama((/ul)) administration ((ul))should((/ul)) therefore use its remaining two years to ((ul))make India a greater priority,((/ul)) especially since the country has not yet figured prominently in the rebalancing of U.S. attention and resources to Asia.

((ul))((hl))That appearance of neglect((/hl))((/ul)), however fair or unfair, ((ul))((hl))has rankled Indian officials and eroded some of their tru((/hl))((/ul))((ul))st((/ul)) in Washington. With the election of a new government in New Delhi, the ((ul))Obama((/ul)) administration ((ul))has a chance to repair the relationship.((/ul)) In May, ((ul))Indians voted into office((/ul)) Narendra ((ul))Modi((/ul)), a Hindu nationalist from the western state of Gujarat ((ul))who has signaled((/ul)) that ((ul))he wants to build a more ambitious partnership((/ul)) with the United States. ((ul))That will happen ((/ul))((ul))only if((/ul))((ul)) Obama pushes India to the top of his foreign policy agenda((/ul)) and Modi implements a series of reforms to enable stronger economic and political ties between the two governments. The leaders are scheduled to hold their first meeting in Washington this September, and before they do, ((ul))both should begin thinking about rebuilding the((/ul)) U.S.-Indian ((ul))relationship in five key ways:((/ul)) ((ul))by expanding bilateral trade((/ul)), ((ul))strengthening military cooperation((/ul)), collaborating to combat threats to homeland security, stabilizing a post-American Afghanistan, ((ul))and((/ul)), especially, ((ul))finding greater common ground on transnational challenges ((/ul))such as climate change. It is an ambitious agenda, but ((ul))pursuing it would put India where it belongs: at the center of U.S. strategy in the region((/ul)). FALLING OUT Many Indian officials look back on the presidency of George W. Bush as a special moment in U.S.-Indian relations. From his first days in office, Bush made India a priority, arguing that its flourishing market economy, entrepreneurial drive, democratic system, and growing young population were crucial to U.S. aims in the region. He saw that the two countries, far from being strategic rivals, shared many of the same views on how power should be balanced in the twenty-first century. He believed that the United States had a clear interest in supporting India's rise as a global power. The results of his emphasis were dramatic. ((ul))The volume of trade in goods and services between the United States and India has more than tripled since 2004.((/ul)) Also since then, the two governments have dramatically strengthened their military ties and launched new cooperative projects on space, science and technology, education, and democratic governance. Bush also engineered one of the most important initiatives in the history of the U.S.-Indian relationship: the civil nuclear agreement, which for the first time permitted U.S. firms to invest in India's civil nuclear power sector. (I served as the lead American negotiator for the deal.) This agreement helped end India's nuclear isolation, allowing New Delhi to trade in civil nuclear technology even though it is not a party to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. In return, India opened up its civil nuclear industry for the first time to sustained international inspection. The agreement's real import, though, lay in its message to the Indian people: the United States took their country seriously and wanted to leave behind the previous decades of cool relations. More broadly, it was a signal of U.S. support for India's emerging global role. When Obama took office, he followed Bush's lead. After all, Bush's India policy had enjoyed rare and strong support from Democrats -- including then U.S. Senators Joseph Biden, Hillary Clinton, and Obama himself -- throughout his second term. In 2009, Obama hosted then Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his wife as the administration's first official state visitors. During his own successful state visit to New Delhi in 2010, Obama became the first U.S. president to endorse India's bid to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council. Yet despite this promising start, ((ul))Obama's India policy never hit full stride((/ul)). Although Clinton, as secretary of state, collaborated with New Delhi on development and women's issues, the administration was understandably preoccupied with the more urgent short-term crises it had inherited on taking office: the global financial meltdown, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the threat of a nuclear Iran. It was a classic Washington story of near-term crises crowding out long-term ambitions. As Obama's first term ended, India slid down Washington's priority list, and Indian officials complained privately about what they saw as a lack of attention from their American counterparts. To be fair to Obama, however, ((ul))the Indian government played an even greater role in the relationship's decline. ((/ul))In 2010, the Indian Parliament passed an ill-advised nuclear liability law that placed excessive responsibility on suppliers for accidents at nuclear power plants. The legislation, which gained support after the 25th anniversary of a horrific chemical spill at an American-owned plant in Bhopal, shattered investor confidence. By deterring U.S. and other firms from entering the Indian market, the law made implementation of the civil nuclear agreement impossible, undermining what should have been the centerpiece of the two countries' relationship. Washington and New Delhi haven't managed to resolve the impasse. The relationship suffered further when Indian economic growth slowed markedly in 2012 and 2013, depressing foreign investment, as the government, led by the Indian National Congress, was rocked by corruption allegations and failed to implement promised reforms in retail, insurance, energy, and infrastructure. New Delhi unwisely imposed discriminatory taxes on foreign investors and enacted protectionist measures that impeded trade. A series of bitterly fought U.S.-Indian trade disputes took center stage, overshadowing the political and military ties that had been the glue of the growing partnership and preventing the two countries from being able to strike any major new economic agreements. Then came two severe diplomatic tempests. Over the course of 2013, as Modi emerged as a front-runner in the upcoming election, the Indian press revived the story of Washington's earlier decision to bar Modi from entering the United States on the grounds that he had failed to suppress deadly anti-Muslim riots in 2002, when he was chief minister of Gujarat. Bush administration officials, including me, believed this to be the right decision at the time, but many Modi supporters charged that the visa ban was yet another example of American disregard for Indian dignity. Then, in December 2013, U.S. federal agents arrested Devyani Khobragade, India's deputy consul general in New York, for lying on her housekeeper's visa application, infuriating the Indian press and public. It was a perfect but avoidable storm. The United States should have handled the visa issue at the core of the dispute in private to avoid inflaming India's bruised ego, and the Indian government, which made matters worse by downgrading security at the U.S. embassy in New Delhi and refusing to renew teachers' visas at the American Embassy School, should have reacted more calmly. Instead, both governments fanned the flames, and anti-American furor dominated the news in India for weeks. ((ul))By early 2014, the collapse in confidence was all too visible, and this is what Obama and Modi must begin working to repair when they meet((/ul)). At the same time, U.S. Secretary of State John ((ul))Kerry((/ul)), Secretary of Defense Chuck ((ul))Hagel, and((/ul)) Secretary of the Treasury Jack ((ul))Lew must act((/ul)), in effect, ((ul))as project managers, steering the relationship past the inevitable obstacles((/ul)), just as then Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice did so capably in Bush's second term. ((ul))((hl))Top-down government leadership is essential to motivate the vast U.S. bureaucracy to put India back at the center of Washington's attentio((/hl))((/ul))((ul))n((/ul)). ((ul))Obama((/ul)), meanwhile, ((ul))will find a willing partner in Modi((/ul)). Remarkably, the prime minister has exhibited no public signs of resentment over the visa issue and, in a show of good faith, decided in May that he would visit Washington instead of insisting that Obama first visit New Delhi. Modi has already demonstrated himself to be an unusually strong Indian leader, who will use his executive authority in a more hands-on fashion than did "],"stats":{"highlightedWords":52}},{"tag":"((hl))Economic changes solve((/hl))","cite":"((hl))Burns, 14((/hl))","text":["(Nicholas Burns, Professor of the Practice of Diplomacy and International Politics at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government and former U.S. Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs What Washington Can Do to Revive Relations With New Delhi, Foreign Affairs, 00157120, Sep/Oct2014, Vol. 93, Issue 5)","((ul))IT'S THE ECONOMY, STUPID((/ul))","((ul))((hl))Obama should focus first on Modi's main priority: reviving the Indian econom((/hl))((/ul))((ul))y((/ul)).

The principle driving force of the media campaign is the traditional China-India rivalry, and its collective pitch is that OBOR is aimed at promoting an imperial Chinese dominance in East Asia, South Asia, and elsewhere. Of course, East Asia is China’s old stomping ground and, as a rising power, it is natural that Beijing would expand its sphere of influence. A more rational response for India in East Asia is to try and outbid China diplomatically and economically by creating small alliances of its own and by offering economic assistance through its own longstanding Look East strategy. Look East, however, has a problem: While it has long looked good on paper, the strategy has never been followed consistently or vigorously by successive Indian prime ministers. Pursuing mega-strategies has never been India’s wont, and in any case the country until recently has lacked the deep funds needed to throw money at Southeast Asian countries who have been sympathetic to India’s aspirations and who would have been happy recipients of its economic assistance. Under Modi things changed. He brought to office a strong desire to couch China-India ties as essentially competitive. But India’s political culture is not so quick to absorb changes of that magnitude. Indian bureaucracies are full of personnel who are deeply mired in the Nehruvian notion of vacuous moralism, which was deeply committed to non-alignment and never paid much attention to the Great Power politics of the 1950s and 1960s. This created a lot of hoopla during the Cold War years, but that hoopla no longer finds an audience, even within Third World countries in the 21st century. ((ul))While emphasizing the competitive nature of Indo-Chinese strategic ties, Modi also has made sure that his country continues to take advantage of China’s own interests in cultivating its economic ties with India((/ul)). This is a nuanced policy from the side of both Beijing and New Delhi. ((ul))As much as Sino-Indian strategic competition remained hot for the past several decades, neither New Delhi nor Beijing wanted to jeopardize their bilateral economic trade.((/ul)) Consequently, bilateral trade \"surged from under $3 billion in 2000 to nearly $52 billion in 2008)…. Even conservative estimates suggest that, by 2020, China-India trade could surpass last year’s US-China total of $409.2 billion and more than half of total projected US-China trade in 2020.\" As China continues to travel toward its goal of becoming the second superpower, it sees India as a challenger that should not be ignored for at least two reasons. First, India has managed to develop close strategic ties with the United States through the purchase of military weapons, the planning of joint military exercises, and the transfer of technology. India also aspires to become a member of the Nuclear Supply Group, after which it would likely become a serious competitor of China in the area of nuclear weapons development. That is one reason why China continues to veto India’s entry into that group, even while it leaves all doors of mutual economic cooperation wide open. China’s greatest success in gaining the upper hand over India is in its multifaceted strategic ties with Pakistan. ((ul))The emergence of a nuclear Pakistan((/ul)), in which China’s transfer of nuclear knowledge and blueprints of actual nuclear weapons designs played a major role, ((ul))tied down India’s own nuclear preparedness on two different fronts: China and Pakistan. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))What bothers India the most is the fact that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor has not only given Pakistan the promise of emergence as a major economic actor((/hl))((/ul)), but that the corridor passes through the disputed territory of Kashmir on the Pakistan border. It is reported that China tried to appease India by offering to change the name of the corridor through Pakistan; however, it dropped that suggestion after Pakistan protested. India’s major objection to the inclusion of the disputed territory was one explicit reason why it decided to boycott the OBOR summit. India’s neighbors are sold on President Xi’s sales pitch for OBOR, which he called the “project of the century,” and these states are poised to join it. Since poverty is the dominant issue throughout South Asia, ((ul))China’s promise that this program will tackle poverty makes a lot of sense to India’s neighbors. India says that promise is mere hype. But as Western-oriented globalization continues to hurt their economies through high unemployment and rising inflation, most poverty-stricken countries of the Third World have started to envision OBOR as a source of economic assistance and financial relief((/ul)). Another Indian criticism depicts OBOR as imperialistic in nature. As one of the main leaders of the non-aligned movement of the Cold War years, India still presumes itself to be a rightful actor to question China’s motives regarding its role as the rising economic power of the 21st Century. However, as another rising economic power of Asia, and an actor that emulates China’s policies of seeking alliances and offering economic assistance to several countries, India is open to like criticism from Beijing. And China never fails to remind the world that, as a former victim of imperialistic policies and occupation by the West and Japan, it has remained firmly opposed to such policies. The global hubs of economic activities -- places such as New York, London, and Berlin -- are likely to have new additions including Beijing and Shanghai. India, meanwhile, has not been able to find an equally promising way to counter OBOR. So, it is left with flimsy excuses (flimsy in the sense that they find no global supportive audience) like criticizing that strategy because it involves the disputed territory of Kashmir that is under Pakistani administration. In all likelihood, through OBOR, the Chinese view of the hierarchy of nations and the pecking order of nation-states is likely to change. ((ul))Despite ((/ul))((ul))all of((/ul))((ul)) the criticisms of its potential complications and its chances for failure, and ((/ul))((ul))((hl))India’s related suspicion of China’s ulterior motives, OBOR carries with it the ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))enormous economic power((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) of China and an ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))equally powerful resolve by its leadership((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) to make it a success((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) Even the United States and Japan realize that and are likely to remain involved in it without joining it, for now. India might be well-advised to revise its own refusal to join.

After all, most have an H-1B and can extend under Section 106(a) or Section 104(c) of AC 21, but as noted previously, some may still not be able to take advantage of AC 21. The EAD in itself will not have a portability benefit. The foreign national will still need to intend to work for the sponsoring employer even if he/she is using the EAD for open market employment. This reservation, valid as it undoubtedly is, focuses only on those already here. It speaks solely to past migration flows not to future ones. ((ul))((hl))For future flows, this will supplement the H-1B by giving employers of foreign nationals another option.

It will not work for those with essential skills but find themselves in the \"Other Worker\" backlog under INA Section 203(b)(3)(iii) with no hope of getting the green card any time soon.

The Executive would not be granting the undocumented legal status for that is what only Congress can do. But, like adjustment of status itself, ((ul))the Executive certainly can create a period of stay that permits the undocumented to remain here. While those out of status or who entered without inspection should not receive employment authorization on a retroactive basis, there is no reason in law or logic why the Executive cannot grant parole on a ((/ul))((ul))nunc((/ul))((ul)) pro ((/ul))((ul))tunc((/ul))((ul)) basis.((/ul))13 Leaving aside the troubling question of whether such a policy change would not reward conduct that violates the law, the retroactive EAD would only cure the unauthorized employment problem but not the overstay or unlawful presence problem. The 3/10 year bar14 is not triggered by a violation of status resulting from unauthorized employment but an overstay past the I-94 validity. For this reason, a retroactive EAD would do nothing to ameliorate the crushing harshness of the 3/10 year bar, though it might restore eligibility in some situations to adjust by avoiding the unauthorized employment preclusion of INA 245(c).15 What would cure the prior unlawful presence would be a retroactive granting of parole. Look at the definition of \"unlawful presence\" in INA 212 (a)(9)(B)(ii). It speaks of being \"present in the United States after the expiration of the period of stay authorized by the Attorney General or is present in the United States without being admitted or paroled.\" So, ((ul))((hl))if you are present in the USA on parole, you are not accumulating any unlawful presence.((/hl))((/ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((ul))((hl))You can grant retroactive parole without overriding the will of Congress.

All such people do us proud by making our cause their own and the need of their loved ones to come in from the shadows is real and present. Indeed, the non-military use of PIP was advocated by top USCIS officials several years ago in a memo to USCIS Director Mayorkas, a memo leaked by its critics who wished successfully to kill it. In the face of inaction on the part of the GOP controlled House to enact immigration reform, granting PIP to all immediate relatives of US citizens would allow them to adjust in the US rather than travel abroad and risk the 3 and 10 year bars of inadmissibility. Such ((ul))administrative relief would be far less controversial than granting deferred action since immediate relatives of US citizens are anyway eligible for permanent residence((/ul)). The only difference is that they could apply for their green cards in the US without needing to travel overseas and apply for waivers of the 3 and 10 year bars. The concept of PIP can be extended to other categories, such as beneficiaries of preference petitions, which the authors have explained in The Tyranny of Priority Dates.

The only place in INA section 245 where the applicant is required to have maintained lawful nonimmigrant status is under INA section 245(c)(7), which is limited to employment-based immigrants. Family-based immigrants are not so subject. What about INA section 245(c)(2)’s insistence on “lawful immigration status” at the snapshot moment of I-485 submission? Even this would not be a problem.

In addition, the INA establishes various mechanisms for enforcing these rules, including by prescribing the removal of aliens found to have entered the United States without permission, or to have violated the terms governing their authorized admission into the country.8 It also established criminal penalties for certain immigration violations. ((ul))((hl))On the other hand, ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))the INA expressly or impliedly confers some discretionary authority on the executive branch in matters of immigration enforcemen((/hl))((/ul))((ul))t((/ul)). For example, the ((ul))INA authorizes immigration officials to grant certain types of benefits or relief to qualifying aliens who ((/ul))((ul))lack lawful immigration status((/ul)). Moreover, the ((ul))INA permits immigration officials to waive certain statutory restrictions that might otherwise render an alien ineligible to receive ((/ul))((ul))particular immigration((/ul))((ul)) benefits((/ul)). The exercise of ((ul))these discretionary authorities may enable some unlawfully present aliens to remain in the United States—through asylum((/ul)), ((ul))temporary protected status((/ul)), ((ul))cancellation of removal, or some other means—rather than being removed((/ul)). In other cases, however, ((ul))aliens((/ul)) who have entered or have stayed in the United States ((ul))in violation of INA requirements may be permitted to remain in the country and, in some cases, legalize their status((/ul)), not as the result of the exercise of expressly delegated authority, but ((ul))as ((/ul))((ul))((hl))a result of ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))the executive branch’s independent discretion in enforcing the law((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) Article II of the Constitution specifically tasks the Executive to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,” and the executive branch has historically been seen as having some discretion (commonly known as prosecutorial or enforcement discretion) in determining when, against whom, how, and even whether to prosecute apparent violations of the law. For example, immigration officials may opt to give a lower priority to the removal of certain categories of unlawfully present aliens because the removal of other categories (e.g., those convicted of serious crimes) has been deemed a higher priority in light of resource constraints and other considerations.16 Congressional enactments could, however, be seen as limiting the executive’s discretion not to take particular actions (e.g., by mandating that certain aliens be detained pending removal proceedings).17 The express adoption of an executive policy that is “in effect an abdication of ... statutory duty” could also be found to be impermissible,18 but ((ul))((hl))it might be difficult for a court to assess the degree of nonenforcement that would entail an “abdication((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)).”((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) The executive branch’s discretion to interpret applicable statutes ((/ul))((ul))((hl))when Congress has not spoken to the precise question at issue may also afford immigration officials some flexibility in determining how INA requirements apply to a particular alien or category of alien((/hl))((/ul))((ul))s((/ul)).19 This discretion may be relevant in determining how particular statutory grants of discretionary authority are to be applied (e.g., what constitutes “exceptional and extremely unusual hardship” for purposes of cancellation of removal, or “extreme hardship” for purposes of certain waivers of inadmissibility).20 It can also play a role in determining whether and how particular statutes are seen to circumscribe the Executive’s enforcement discretion.

Over the past few weeks, I've been struck in reading the many news stories about the brewing confrontation by the fact that none of the stories addresses what seems to me the central question at the heart of the developing standoff between the President and Congress: How much discretion does Obama have under the Immigration and Naturalization Act to decline, as a matter of policy, to deport millions of people? ((ul))Republicans are tossing around all sorts of rhetoric about Obama's decision to proceed unilaterally. John Boehner has floated the idea of litigating the matter((/ul)). Some Republicans have described such an \"amnesty\" as a constitutional crisis. ((ul))Some have even talked about impeachment((/ul)). All of that assumes, of course, that the coming action is illegal, that the statute itself doesn't give Obama authority to decide to stay his hand with respect to lots of deportations. ((ul))((hl))Yet I have seen ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))no news story or legal analysis that contains an actual argument to that effect((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). ((/ul))We do not yet know exactly what President Obama intends to do, so we cannot hold the details of his coming executive action up against the statute. But if we are to believe news reports, he plans to create some kind of program under which undocumented aliens who meet certain criteria---family members in the United States, no criminal record, etc.---can come forward and receive what amounts to a quasi-legal status under which authorities will not pursue removal actions against them. Obama himself has sown doubt about this own authority to effectuate this policy outcome without congressional involvement---stating in the past that he would love to do it, but did not think he had the legal authority. But at least as I read ((ul))the relevant provisions of the Immigration and Naturalization Act, the statute ((/ul))((ul))actually gives((/ul))((ul)) him wide discretion to decline to deport non-criminal aliens who are legally deportable. S((/ul))pecifically, it contains no directive requiring the administration to pursue garden variety deportation cases. In fact, it has very little to say at all---except with respect to aliens who have committed crimes---about what happens if the President just doesn't feel like deporting people. That silence seems to me to convey the authority not to act, both in the case of an individual whose circumstances authorities find compelling and also in the case of five million people whose circumstances authorities find compelling or whose status authorities choose for policy reasons to regularize. Let's go through the statute. The key legal requirement appears in 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a): \"((ul))Any alien . . . in and admitted to the United States shall, upon the order of the Attorney General, be removed if the alien is within one or more of the following classes of deportable aliens.\" What follows is a long list of legal bases for deportation, but for present purposes, what matters is the language of this general command. It appears((/ul))((ul)), on first glance, to((/ul))((ul)) be mandatory. The alien, after all, shall be removed. But look again. The mandatory language only applies \"upon the order of the Attorney General.\"((/ul)) And the statute makes no demand that the attorney general issue such an order merely because an alien falls into one of the categories of deportability. ((ul))The statute, in other words, requires that an alien be removed if he is within a deportable class and if the attorney general orders him removed. As a practical matter, the attorney general does not decide these things himself. There's a whole immigration adjudication system to decide these cases for him (subject to his ultimate review). And the statute lays out a whole framework for immigration adjudications, all based on the assumption that the government wants to deport a given individual.((/ul)) Thus, 8 U.S.C. § 1229, begins by requiring that the alien receive written notice of the case against him or her. And 8 U.S.C. § 1229a lays out all sorts of details surrounding the conduct of the proceedings that follow. But what do these provisions---the first of which is entitled \"Initiation of removal proceedings\"---say about the obligation of authorities to, well, initiate removal proceedings? Exactly nothing. They simply assume that the immigration authorities want the person in question removed from the country. Nothing in either provision requires that authorities do, in fact, want him or her removed or start a case against him or her. And nothing that I can see forbids the president from directing that his underlings stay their hands in initiating removal proceedings, either in individual cases or in whole classes of cases. In the immigration context, Congress certainly knows how to remove discretion from the attorney general. In 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c), for example, ((ul))the legislature bluntly directs that \"The Attorney General shall take into custody any alien\" who has committed certain classes of crimes pending ((/ul))((ul))deportation.a((/ul)) A provision that follows mandates the detention of suspected alien terrorists. And 8 U.S.C. § 1231 directs that \"when an alien is ordered removed, the Attorney General shall remove the alien from the United States within a period of 90 days.\" During that time, authorities \"shall detain the alien. Under no circumstance during the removal period shall [they] release an alien who has been found inadmissible . . . or . . . deportable.\" So one has to assume that the silence as to any sort of requirement that the government initiate deportation proceedings against non-criminal aliens is not an accident. It is a grant of discretion of sorts. To be sure, it was probably a grant of discretion predicated on the assumption that presidents would want to remove deportable aliens from the country. ((ul))The idea that a president would build a whole programmatic policy edifice out of the discretion that resides in this silence surely never crossed anyone's mind. That said, I can't see any legal impediment to President Obama's anticipated course of action.((/ul)) I am no immigration law expert, so that fact may not mean all that much. ((ul))If some reader out there who has studied the statute has a theory as to why the President lacks discretion to decline to initiate five million removal actions, I'd love to hear it.

((ul))The Border Patrol has since phased out this practice and largely replaced it with “expedited removal,” which involves a formal writ of deportation that impedes a person from obtaining a legal entry visa for five years or more((/ul)). ((ul))This change in tactic might seem like a bit of bureaucratic arcana but it has had real impact on the lives of migrants and on migration patterns((/ul)). Previously, many would-be migrants who had applied for a green card would enter the United States illegally to live and work while they waited out the half decade or more it takes to clear the queue for a permanent residence visa. For these individuals, being an undocumented immigrant was just one part of the migration life cycle. ((ul))By raising the legal stakes of being apprehended, the switch from voluntary to expedited removal has made prospective legal immigrants wary about entering the country through any means other than legal channels.((/ul)) ((ul))((hl))There are ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))many further actions a future president could take without congressional authorization((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) that would directly or indirectly raise barriers to immigratio((/hl))((/ul))((ul))n.

((/ul))((ul))((hl))Congress has now given away much of its plenary power over immigration to the Executive((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) in sweeping grants of power—more sweeping grants than in any other area of the law((/ul)). For example((ul)), Congress has delegated the power to the Executive Branch to determine whether the United States is at war such that military members can be naturalized;((/ul)) to determine ((ul))whether foreigners should be granted temporary protected status((/ul)); to determine ((ul))whether a person is allowed to work in the United States((/ul)); to ((ul))grant a person permission to be in the U.S. when the person does not qualify for a visa; and to decide whether a person’s deportation should be deferred. As a result of two judicially-created developments—the plenary power doctrine, and the doctrine that Congress may delegate its power to the President—((/ul))((ul))((hl))the Executive Branch today enjoys expansive power over immigration((/hl))((/ul)). Many people recently became upset when the Executive Branch exercised these powers delegated to it by Congress—((ul))but until Congress amends or repeals these broad grants of authority to the Executive, the President is on firm legal ground. President Barack Obama has come under fire for using the authority granted to him by Congress and ratified by the Supreme Court’s plenary power doctrine((/ul)). He has faced a firestorm of criticism from both sides of the political aisle. His use of his authority harkens back to an earlier Democratic President—Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who was President of the United States when the Supreme Court abandoned the non-delegation doctrine in favor of allowing Congress to cede its powers to the President. ((ul))Since FDR’s time, the balance of power in areas such as foreign affairs, national security, and immigration has tilted strongly towards the Executive Branch((/ul))—with explicit and implicit authority from Congress and the gloss of history only strengthening the Executive’s power. Like FDR, President Obama has used his executive authority in controversial ways. His “national security” rationale for holding Central American refugees in detention camps has drawn comparisons to FDR’s often-criticized detention of Japanese residents during World War II. President Obama has also been criticized for deferring the deportations of young people who have graduated from U.S. high schools. And finally, he has been sued for attempting to give temporary work permits to the parents of U.S. citizen children so that those parents can work to support their families, rather than relying on public handouts. In the end, the Court-created doctrines that have allowed his predecessors to exercise these same powers are likely to ratify his actions, however controversial and seemingly unconstitutional they may seem to the casual observer. When it comes to immigration law and policy, the Founding documents no longer control America’s destiny—rather, ((ul))the ever-evolving doctrines of the United States Supreme Court, and the dysfunction of Congress, have left the ((/ul))((ul))immigration power firmly in Executive hands.((/ul))"],"stats":{"highlightedWords":46}},{"tag":"No Tyranny – 4 checks on presidential power","cite":"Goldstein ‘99 (Joel K., Prof. Of Law, St. Louis Univ., The Presidency and the Rule of Law: Some Preliminary Explorations, 43 St. Louis L.J. 791, Summer) ","text":[" Would these concessions to executive interpretive autonomy leave us naked before a Chief Executive prone to self-aggrandizement?

States as Potentially Fertile Ground for Expanding Presidential Power ((ul))((hl))While states may find limited ways to((/hl))((/ul)) successfully ((ul))((hl))resist presidential action on immigration, the more powerful trend appears to be the way((/hl))((/ul)) in which ((ul))((hl))the President can use states to help entrench his policy vision on immigration((/hl))((/ul)), thereby ((ul))gaining a stronger position vis-à-vis Congress((/ul)). Relatedly, ((ul))these state and local policies can constrain the policy choices politically available to a future group of federal legislators. This was certainly true in((/ul)) the case of ((ul))DACA((/ul)), as ((ul))actions by the Executive prompted most states to reexamine and modify their policies on driver’s licenses((/ul)), the overwhelming majority of which previously required proof of legal presence in the United States.374 Moreover, beyond licenses, ((ul))other important state and local areas for immigrant integration, such as local identification cards, state tuition policies, public welfare provision, and even health care, have all witnessed accelerated momentum after DACA((/ul)).375 This Article does not claim that the Obama Administration intended these state-level policy changes when it implemented DACA. Indeed, there is no mention of state driver’s licenses in any of the federal government’s documents outlining the contours of DACA or its effects on potential beneficiaries or state and local jurisdictions.376 At the same time, the ((ul))administrative creation of((/ul)) a large class of ((ul))persons((/ul)) who now are ((ul))temporarily lawfully present despite((/ul)) their ((ul))unlawful status((/ul)) virtually ((ul))necessitated some state-level response.((/ul))377 With a group of a few hundred thousand DACA recipients openly attending schools and seeking employment, and needing transportation to take advantage of both,378 ((ul))DACA helped ease the policy climate for states desirous of accounting for all residents, regardless of immigration status((/ul)). This process—an exogenous shock (this one prompted by the President’s decision on DACA) provoking a rash of changes in state policies on driver’s licenses—comports very closely with what Professors Frank Baumgartner and Bryan Jones have called a “punctuated equilibrium,” in which an exogenous development upends a status quo of policy inertia, which subsequently catalyzes processes that propel toward rapid change.379 The President’s action on DACA is exogenous because the Administration was not seeking to change state policy on driver’s licenses when it announced its policy in June 2012.380 Additionally, the policy reverberations from the 2012 executive action continue. As DACA recipients renew their status and continue to establish deep ties to their communities through education, work, and family ties, they appear more and more as a permanently non-deportable group. Thus, ((ul))by regularizing, without legalizing, hundreds of thousands of previously unauthorized immigrants, the President’s action catalyzed states and localities into dealing with the everyday needs of these residents and their families. ((/ul))Thinking more broadly from the perspective of presidential power in a federalism framework, ((ul))((hl))states and localities provide potentially fertile grounds for the Executive Branch to entrench its policy vision, especially in jurisdictions led by officials of the same party as the President((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul))381 Unlike Congress, ((ul))((hl))state legislatures cannot provide lawful status to recipients of deferred action((/hl))((/ul)).

((/ul))This dynamic of state and local officials seeking to provide more popular backing to executive action has also been evident in recent actions by large-city mayors.

As Professor Judith Resnick notes, these types of translocal governmental organizations can cross territorial lines to help shape and spread policies.389 In this way—and often with the help of policy entrepreneurs—federalism takes on a horizontal dimension,390 in addition to its vertical component and its separation of powers possibilities.

Global Brain Drain","The phenomenon of international brain drain is based on two premises: there are few highly educated people in developing nations,  [*936]  and those highly educated people are extremely likely to emigrate. n58 It is defined as a \"significant loss of the highly educated population\" resulting in negative economic effects in the sending country. n59 These negative effects are often twofold, including a loss of human capital as well as a loss of the government's return on its investment in its citizenry. n60 For example, a developing country may invest significant amounts of money in educating and providing healthcare to its youths on the understanding that they will mature into informed, healthy, and productive members of the national society. n61 That understanding collateralizes the investment. n62 Whenever a highly skilled, highly educated citizen emigrates, the country enters a loss on its ledger.","((ul))((hl))Although it is understandable that the best and brightest of a developing nation emigrate for a better life and additional opportunities, this ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))strips the sending nation((/hl))((/ul)) (perhaps more aptly described as the deprived nation) ((ul))((hl))of valuable resources necessary for continuing development((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) In this regard, ((ul))African countries have been acutely affected, and widespread emigration from the continent ((/ul))((ul))\"((/ul))((ul))((hl))threatens Africa with yet another net loss of quality human resources\" ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))similar to((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) the effect of the slave trade((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) n63 ((ul))One scholar estimates that twenty to fifty percent of the \"top African brains and skilled personnel\" have left the continent and fail to retain significant professional ties with their homelands.((/ul)) n64 The 2005 World Migration Report, compiled by the International Organization for Migration, called attention to the loss of human resources from the continent, a trend which one scholar predicts will culminate in Africa's transformation into an \"intellectually barren ghetto.\" n65","By contrast, developed countries benefit greatly from this continual injection of brains and talent, and they even compete with each other over immigrant candidates. n66 As Professor Ayelet Shachar, of  [*937]  the law faculty at the University of Toronto, explains, \"industrial countries are trying to outbid one another ... to attract highly skilled migrants to their domestic industries in order to gain (or retain) a relative advantage over their international competitors in the knowledge-based global economy.\" n67 From this perspective, encouraging highly skilled immigration becomes yet another strategy in the broad reach of a developed country's economy. n68 Reflecting upon this conceptualization of the immigrant as human capital, Professor Kunal M. Parker, of Cleveland-Marshall College of Law, aptly concludes that receiving countries measure the value of an aspiring immigrant based on her profile as \"homo oeconomicus.\" n69 Thus, brain drain is the inevitable symptom of a widespread \"reimagination of legal immigration in terms of productivity, skill, resources, and self-sufficiency.\" n70","((ul))The((/ul)) ((ul))U((/ul))nited ((ul))S((/ul))tates ((ul))is the most popular destination country for skilled immigrants((/ul)), n71 and it is easy to imagine why. The nation boasts expansive opportunities for the well-educated and highly skilled, and its immigration policies reward such a showing of talent. Admittedly, arguments appealing to international concerns often do not fare well in shaping U.S. laws. n72 U.S. immigration law is, without illusion, designed with the goal of furthering U.S. interests. n73 Critics of U.S. immigration policy have often urged an even stronger preferencing of  [*938]  elite immigrants rather than tempering the meritocracy. n74 This position is understandable and in no sense irrational from either a legal or policy perspective; after all, the United States was arguably founded on the ideas that social mobility was possible and that hard work and high achievement would be rewarded. n75","((ul))((hl))Brain drain((/hl))((/ul)) is detrimental, however, even with purely domestic goals in mind: it ((ul))((hl))directly undercuts U.S. foreign policy regarding global development and democracy promotion ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))and also((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) subverts border control policy aimed at reducing unauthorized entrie((/hl))((/ul))((ul))s((/ul)).

In a presentation to USAID on the relationship between migration and development, the Migration Policy Institute emphasized the \"potential [domestic] benefits of a 'brain export' industry,\" while at the same time acknowledging that efforts to repatriate such highly skilled immigrants - and thus mitigate the negative effects in sending countries - have generally failed. n78","[*939]  ((ul))Although((/ul))((ul)) remittances by highly skilled and highly educated migrants may contribute to economic development in sending countries, it is harder to assert that these remittances similarly contribute to democracy promotion((/ul)), which has become a prominent focus of USAID policy since 2002. n79 ((ul))Democracy((/ul)), especially in contrast to other forms of governance, ((ul))requires a certain financial stability and economic security in governmental entities((/ul)); the populace relies on the state to provide healthcare, educate the nation's youth, and, at least to some extent, redistribute wealth. n80 ((ul))Democratic governments must also exercise self-determination over their economic policies, a significant feat in the current international political economy.((/ul)) n81 ((ul))The((/ul))((ul)) infrastructure and bureaucratic capabilities necessary to accomplish these stepping stones to democracy rely on an educated, informed citizenry((/ul))((ul)), which must fill the roles of leaders and constituencies.((/ul)) ((ul))Promoting \"brain export\" hardly seems consistent with promoting democracy, and, therefore, the ((/ul))((ul))U((/ul))nited ((ul))S((/ul))tates ((ul))impairs its own global policy goals with its domestic immigration law((/ul)). n82","((ul))Border control policy is also underserved by an EB immigration system that engenders brain drain. Immigration is often motivated by a lack of employment and economic opportunity in the home country((/ul)), n83 ((ul))and the current allocation of EB-3 visas serves only a fraction of aspiring EB-3 immigrants.((/ul)) n84 Although the intent behind these statutory restrictions is likely to recalibrate the nature of the immigrant  [*940]  flow, n85 the result is a near trainwreck of supply and demand curves.

For example, ((ul))there were systematic annual increases((/ul)) in the ((ul))migration((/ul)) of African refugees ((ul))during the latter part of the 1990s((/ul)). In fact, by the year 2000 African refugee migration was among the top two types of migration flows driving overall African emigration to the U.S. There were, however, abrupt declines in these trends between 2001 and 2002 as a result of the temporary suspension of the U.S. refugee resettlement program after the September 11 attacks (Bruno, 2006). However, these trends rebounded around 2003 ⁄ 2004 but have since been on the decline.

For example, the results show consistent increases in the mean number of Africans emigrating as the immediate relatives of U.S. citizens. A possible explanation for these increases is that earlier cohorts of African immigrants may be increasingly fulfilling the residency requirement for U.S. citizenship thus becoming more legally eligible to sponsor the migration of their immediate kin. Emigration of nonimmediate family members, however, occurs on a much smaller scale. ((ul))Contrary to expectations, few highly skilled individuals are emigrating from Africa to the U.S. through formal employment preferences((/ul)).

The immigration between a lot of these countries is really nonexistent,\" Firsing says, \"It's a statistical nightmare, this movement. People say there are more and more opportunities back in Africa, but what I found, particularly among my friends who went off to work in Australia … they're getting picked up left, right and center from Africa.\"¶ Part of the reason for migration, he says, is a lack of opportunity – both professionally and in the realm of education. He says it's common for young, aspiring professionals to travel to Europe, the U.S. or Australia to further their education.¶ \"((ul))In Africa, you don't really see that connection between the private sector and the universities.

And if they do, they end up just leaving.\"¶ Even South Africa – a country that serves as a destination point for many African migrants from the north – is suffering the effects of a brain drain. Competition from China has \"decimated\" the country's once vibrant manufacturing sector, Firsing says, and other opportunities for skilled workers have left the country as industries requiring such expertise have dried up.¶ And for those who already left for school or work in other countries, it's often difficult to justify returning, he says.

Some 60 percent of large herbivore species are threatened with extinction thanks to overhunting, poaching, and the depletion suitable habitat. ((/ul))Now((ul)), researchers have zeroed in on ((/ul))((ul))((hl))another human-driven source of trouble for these animals: armed conflict. In Africa, wildlife populations living in regions frequently embroiled in war cope ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))poorly((/hl))((/ul))((ul)),((/ul))((ul)) and((/ul))((ul)) suffer substantial population declines.((/ul))","In recent years, the bulk of armed conflicts have taken place in Africa and Asia—continents that also host the most large mammal species on the edge of extinction. This alignment of war and wildlife certainly seems like it could have major impacts large herbivore populations, but the effects haven’t been well studied. That’s why conservation ecologists Joshua Daskin and Robert Pringle, from Yale and Princeton Universities, respectively, decided to look at at African protected areas and compare known, long-term population trajectories of big herbivores with the relative degree and frequency of armed conflict.","A continent-wide examination of Africa’s protected spaces was a natural choice for the research team. As lead study author Daskin told Earther, the scientists had previously conducted research in Mozambique’s Gorongosa National Park, which lost more than 90 percent of its large mammal species during the nation’s 1977-1992 civil war—and has since rebounded to within 80 percent of its former glory.","“We wondered if the impacts of war on wildlife in Gorongosa were emblematic of its effects elsewhere,” Daskin said","The research team first dug into databases that revealed armed conflict events in and around more than 3,500 protected areas in fifty-one African countries. By standardizing nearly seventy years of conflict occurrence data (from 1946 to 2010), the researchers found an average number of “conflict-years” for each protected area. Continent-wide, seven out of ten protected areas overlapped with a conflict zone during these decades.","To determine how herbivore populations were affected in these conflict zones, the researchers scoured the scientific literature for fine-scale data on the population densities of various species((ul)). In the end, the researchers had comparisons between conflict scenarios and population trends for over 250 populations of thirty-six species living in 126 protected areas((/ul)). The species in question ranged from elephants to antelope to buffalo.","The team also tested the impact of other factors on herbivore populations, like the intensity of the violence, the proximity to urban areas, and the body mass of the species in question.","The results, published today in the journal Nature, show just how vulnerable Africa’s most beloved and charismatic wildlife are to repeated human conflict.","((ul))((hl))Conflict frequency was the most effective and important predictor of wildlife population trends((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) among all factors((/hl))((/ul)). ((ul))The more often there was armed conflict, the heavier the toll was on local wildlife, with the highest-frequency conflict zones almost invariably causing populations to plummet.((/ul)) Interestingly, conflict intensity didn’t seem to have much influence; rather, ((ul))the presence of any armed conflict was ((/ul))((ul))sufficient((/ul))((ul)) to adversely impact animal populations. ((/ul))","To Daskin, this is important information for any future conservation work to take place in conflict zones.","“Our study is the first to provide an estimate of the effects of war on wildlife over long time periods and large (continent-wide) spatial scales,” Daskin said. “This is useful when prioritizing funding for conservation, because it can improve the assumptions that researchers and conservation managers make when planning where to invest in conservation efforts.”","The exact reasons why war appears to negatively affects these herbivores remain a bit murky. ((ul))Research published in 2016 suggests that much of the ecological impact of war comes from indirect effects, rather than the physical, violent act of war itself. Rhinos and gazelles likely aren’t casualties of weapons and military activity, but victims of the chaos that war leaves behind.

Very few populations were wiped out permanently in this study. Post-conflict, there may be great opportunities for restoration initiatives, said Daskin.","For how to effectively manage wildlife populations when peace comes to a conflict zone, Daskin suggests we look to Gorongosa and its remarkable recovery as an example. A huge part of its success may come from how the park was managed in synchrony with development aid for humans.","“The few remaining wildlife were allowed to reproduce under the watch of park rangers who conduct anti-poaching patrols, but also in conjunction with critical human development programs,” Daskin said. “Providing socio-economic assistance helps alleviate the need for people to hunt wildlife.”","By enacting rapid interventions during ceasefires, the researchers contend that some of the indirect effects of conflict on wildlife may be eased, hopefully ensuring that these iconic, ecologically and economically vital species regain their lost numbers."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":65}},{"tag":"Economic downturn in sending countries increases rates of emigration","cite":"Thomas 11—Kevin J.A.

One consequence of these transformations is that Africans now dream ‘‘of enjoying the better life in the U.S.’’ (Nwoye, 2009:96), or expect to migrate to other destinations in the West to achieve their desired higher living standards (Van Dalen, Groenewold, and Schoorl, 2005).¶ ((ul))Increasingly, neo-classical type explanations are((/ul)) also ((ul))being used in research on contemporary trends in skilled migration, or the ‘‘((/ul))((ul))braindrain((/ul))((ul)),’’ from Africa to the U.((/ul))S.

His basic premise is that ((ul))migration flows are a product of the immigration laws of states((/ul)) (Zolberg, 1999). States, for example, can set numerical limits on immigrant admissions and determine the characteristics of immigrants allowed to live within their borders. Thus, as the historical evidence demonstrates, the first phase of African migration to the U.S. was brought to an end by state laws abolishing the legal trade in slaves. Similarly, the U.S. state, through the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, abolished pre-1960 immigration quotas, thereby providing new opportunities for Africans to emigrate to the U.S. Yet, the evidence suggests that this action resulted in limited increases in African migration to the U.S. immediately following the 1960s compared with the increases observed at the end of the century. More ((ul))((hl))generally, ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))a number of((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) scholars((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))(e.g., Lobo, 2001; KonaduAgyemang and Takyi, 2006) ((ul))((hl))argue that the surge in African immigration to the U.S. reflects the impacts of the U.S. Diversity Visa (DV) Program((/hl))((/ul)) created as part of the 1990 immigration reforms. This program, which seeks to increase immigration from nontraditional sending countries, was implemented in the mid-1990s and has facilitated the migration of approximately 20,000 Africans per year since its inception (KonaduAgyemang and Takyi, 2006). Conceptually, however, the legal framework of destination states does not preclude variations in migration trends between origin and destination countries. These variations can occur, for example, as a result of structural changes in origin countries that affect the incentive to migrate across time.¶ ((ul))World Systems theory((/ul)) (Wallerstein, 1974, 1980) also ((ul))provides useful insights into the likely determinants of African migration to the U.S.((/ul)) As Massey et al. (1998) note, ((ul))early proponents of the theory focused on the ‘‘brain-drain’’ as a product of Western exploitation of developing countries. However, the dynamics of African emigration to the West can also be understood within the context of two further implications((/ul)) of the World Systems theory. The first stems from the fact that ((ul))((hl))the theory considers migration to be a product of the penetration of capitalist economic relationships into less-developed countries((/hl))((/ul)). Accordingly, ((ul))as wealthy multinational corporations penetrate poorer countries((/ul)) (e.g., those in Africa) ((ul))they create mobile populations through processes of labor displacement((/ul)) (Massey et al., 1998). Secondly, World Systems theory also suggests that ((ul))emigration from Africa to the West is driven by cultural and ideological linkages created by the latter during the period of colonial rule in Africa((/ul)) (Fonseca 2000; Thierry, 2004; Castles and Miller, 2009). Linkages created by British Colonialists, for example, resulted in the adoption of English as the official language spoken in their former colonies in Africa. Given the role of linguistic proficiency in determining postimmigration success, World Systems theory would hypothesize that contemporary African migration to the U.S. will be driven by emigration flows from English than non-English-speaking African countries."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":43}},{"tag":"There is a direct correlation between an increase in DV-based immigration and deteriorating economic conditions in sending countries","cite":"Jones 09—Adzele K Jones, 2009 (“Togo on my Mind,” The New African Diaspora, Indiana UP, 2009, ISBN 978-0-253-35337-5, p. 61-77, Accessed 07-08-2018)//hk ","text":["((ul))Although most Africans migrate to Europe, mainly because of lasting colonial ties, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))recent records have shown a great trend of African migration to the United States.

In fact, many countries campaign and employ strategies to attract them. As Gumisai Mutume states, industrial countries need migrants because they often face labor shortages in highly skilled areas such as information technology and health services, as well as for trade jobs in agriculture, manufacturing, and construction (Mutume 15). On the whole, Africans who immigrate to the U.S. or Europe are usually well- educated or skilled professionals.¶ According to Rotimi Sankore, ((ul))the U.S. Diversity Visa Program recruits skilled and educated Africans((/ul)) (4).

(2009, p. 62) note that in the United Kingdom, “each qualifying doctor costs £200,000–£250,000 and 5–6 years to train, so in economic terms, every doctor arriving in the United Kingdom is appropriating human capital at zero cost for the use of the UK health services and the effect is immediate rather than in 5 years’ time”. In addition to the waste of resources invested in education, the early literature on the brain drain supports the view that ((ul))skilled migration has several negative effects on the source countries((/ul)) (see, among others, Bhagwati and Hamada 1974; Kwok and Leland 1982). ((ul))There are four main messages((/ul)) delivered by the traditional literature: (i) the ((ul))((hl))brain drain deprives developing countries of one of their scarcest resources((/hl))((/ul)), i.e. human capital; (ii) ((ul))((hl))skilled migrants are net fiscal contributors and their departure represents a fiscal loss((/hl))((/ul)) for their home countries; (iii) ((ul))human capital is a source of economic growth and((/ul)) the brain drain negatively affects the countries’ economic performance and growth prospect; and (iv) the ((ul))decrease in human capital seriously affects the countries capacity for innovation and the adoption of modern technologies and increases inequality((/ul)) at the international level, ((ul))with rich countries becoming richer at the expense of the poor countries((/ul)). More recent literature mitigates the above pessimistic view by putting forward several potential compensatory effects of the brain drain. The channels through which these effects may take place are different. For example, return migration can be a beneficial route if returning migrants use the additional knowledge acquired abroad to start up new entrepreneurial activities and contribute to the diffusion of new technology (Stark et al. 1997; Gubert and Nordman 2008; Wahba and Zenou 2009). Other scholars argue that highly skilled migrants promote bilateral trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) between countries of origin and destination through the creation of business networks (see Harris and Schmitt 2003 for a survey and Blanes 2005 for a case study focusing on Spain). Furthermore, Wahba and Zenou (2009) found that Egyptian return migrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs than non-migrants. Gubert and Nordman (2008) reached similar conclusions for return migrants to the Maghreb. Moreover, remittances can help poverty reduction. Studies conducted focusing on African countries show that remittances can favor the development of the source country (Adams et al. 2009). Other studies have documented a beneficial effect of remittances on education and poverty reduction (see, for example, Sasin 2008; Herrera et al. 2008; Roushdy et al. 2009). However, Faini (2007) argues that as skilled migrants come, in general, from wealthy families,9 their propensity to remit is relatively lower. ((ul))((hl))Consequently, the negative impact of the brain drain on source countries might not be mitigated by the favorable effect of remittances((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).((/hl)) Another important strand of literature, which Faini((ul)) ((/ul))(2003) labeled the “revisionist” approach to the analysis of the brain drain, has put forward the concept of brain gain as a potential beneficial effect of highly skilled migration. For example, Mountford (1997); Stark et al. (1997); Vidal (1998); Beine and Docquier (2001) and Beine et al. (2001) argue that if returns to education are higher abroad than at home, the prospects of migration might increase the expected return of human capital, thereby stimulating human capital formation among residents in source countries. As long as only a fraction of the increased highly skilled labor force end up migrating (due to migration uncertainty), the source country’s long-run stock of human capital might be higher than it would have been without migration opportunities. When the incentive effect described above (the brain gain) dominates the observed brain drain effect, we can talk about a net brain gain for the source country. Beine et al. (2008) found that ((ul))there are countries which benefit from the brain drain, “the winners”,((/ul)) in the authors’ terminology, ((ul))and countries which experience a net loss of human capital, “the losers”((/ul)). However, the latter are a larger number than the former and their losses are higher than the gains of the winners. ((ul))Net gains are obtained in large countries which combine low levels of human capital and low high-skilled emigration rates, while among the losers there are many small African countries characterized by low per capita income((/ul)) (strong financial constraints to education) ((ul))and high rates of skilled migration((/ul)). Other studies focusing on the impact of migration of health personnel found that the ((ul))medical brain drain has a detrimental effect on public health, measured as the rate of adult death and infant child mortality((/ul)) (for example, Bhargava et al. 2011). The evidence for the possible existence of a medical brain gain is mixed. Chojnicki and Oden-Defoort (2010) found that ((ul))((hl))there might be a brain gain for most African countries, given the positive impact of the medical brain drain on the number of graduates from medical schools((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).((/hl)) ((ul))However((/ul)), Bhargava et al. (2011) argue that ((ul))((hl))the effect is likely to be too small to compensate for the losses caused by the migration of highly skilled medical professionals((/hl))((/ul))((hl)). I((/hl))t would then be important, from the policy perspective, that those African countries which are hit the hardest by the medical brain drain phenomenon try and implement policies that mitigate the bad economic conditions for physicians, which represent the main causes of their emigration (see Clemens and Pettersson 2006). We should keep in mind that the conclusion emerging from these empirical studies should be interpreted with caution, as their results may differ according to the methodology and data use. For example, Beine et al. (2001) found a positive net gain for developing countries as a whole (+2.2 per cent of tertiary graduates), however Docquier et al.’s (2008) conclusion is more pessimistic: ((ul))the number of “winners” is very limited and, more significantly, the brain drain has a negative effect on the total number of the tertiary educated in developing countries ((/ul))(–2.7 per cent tertiary graduates)."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":123}},{"tag":"Distrust claims of brain gain—our methodology is the least suspect and the most comparative","cite":"Capuano and Marfouk 13—Stella Capuano, empirical economist at the Institute for Employment Studies, she has conducted large-scale macro data collection on international migration in OECD countries, PhD in economics from the University of Turin, and Abdeslam Marfouk, Center for Ethnic and Migration Studies, (CEDEM), University of Liege and IWEPS, 2013 (“African Brain Drain and Its Impact on Source Countries: What Do We Know and What Do We Need to Know?” Journal of Comparative Policy Analysis, Vol. 15, No. 4, 2013, p. 297-314, Available Online at https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13876988.2013.813122, Accessed 07-16-2018)//hk","text":["It is worth noticing that the ((ul))((hl))theoretical and applied works on the brain gain may suffer from different shortcomings((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).

The best illustration can be found in the Third European Report on Science and Technology in which the European Commission (2003, p. 225) emphasizes: It is common to present the emigration of European students and researchers as a threat to Europe’s competitiveness in scientific fields and applied research. The exodus of highly qualified scientists and engineers, often described as “brain drain”, may weaken the field of research in Europe, while strengthening the continent’s main competitor, the US. In same report, the European Commission (2003, p. 222) points out: The loss of human resources to the US may put a strain on national education systems and place EU employers in a position where there is severe competition with their US counterparts for S&T personnel. A more serious consequence could be that the drain of EU based talent and skills leads to a further relative strengthening and growth of knowledge-intensive industries in the US. ((ul))If the brain gain is a general theory, it should lead to the same conclusions regardless the countries of origin to which it applies((/ul)). More importantly, we should also take into consideration that ((ul))((hl))the analysis of brain gain may suffer from different shortcomings((/hl))((/ul)). First of all, ((ul))the emigration rate should, ideally, be calculated as a ratio of the emigrant to the origin countries’ native population.

Who are the suckers that get those people?” he added, seemingly referring to the U.S.((/ul)) Trump called Saipov an “animal” and said he would consider sending him to Guantanamo Bay, a detention facility where alleged perpetrators of the 9/11 terrorist attacks have remained on trial for years. ((ul))((hl))Restrictionists((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) have for years targeted the lottery, which provides legal pathways for people from countries with historically low immigration rates to the U.S., making it an ideal target for Trump((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) Established in 1990, the lottery provides only 50,000 visas annually, and applicants are required to have completed at least a high school education or at least two years of work experience. Visas are distributed among nationals from six different regions. ((ul))Trump is backing a bill that would end the diversity visa lottery program and cut other forms of family-based routes to come to the country legally, with the explicit goal of halving legal immigration.((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))Eliminating the lottery was also included on a lengthy list of policy demands that the president sent to Congress last month. Trump laid out the requests after eliminating a program that protects young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children and saying he would sign a bill to let them stay in the country only if he was granted other policy concessions.((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Trump has called for slashing legal immigration by moving to a “merit-based” system that would allow fewer people to come to the U.S. based on family ties or through the visa lottery((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) He did so again on Wednesday. Trump called the lottery program a “Chuck Schumer beauty,” piggybacking off of other right-wing attacks on the Democratic senator from New York, who was one of the people to introduce the bill. He also sponsored the larger immigration bill that ultimately passed. Schumer shot back Wednesday, saying in a statement that Trump “should be focusing on the real solution ― anti-terrorism funding ― which he proposed cutting in his most recent budget.” Schumer helped push for the creation of the diversity visa lottery, but he also co-authored a bill that would have ended it. In 2013, he was part of the so-called Gang of Eight who drafted a bill that would have granted a path to citizenship to many undocumented immigrants, dramatically ramped up border security efforts and overhauled legal immigration. The bill passed the Senate but never got a vote in the House. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), another member of the Gang of Eight, came to Schumer’s defense on Wednesday by pointing out that the 2013 bill “did away with the Diversity Visa Program as part of broader reforms.” “I know, I was there,” Flake tweeted. Trump likely tagged “Fox & Friends” in one of his tweets because Sebastian Gorka, a former assistant to the president, appeared on the show Wednesday morning to discuss the visa program and advocate for its revision. “The idea that we’re just going to ― if you got a high school diploma and two years of work experience, we can roll the dice and can you come into America and it’s not based upon whether or not you are [a] strength [to] the nation ― that has to end,” Gorka said. He mentioned countries like Australia and New Zealand, which he claimed have “incredibly stringent immigration requirements” based on education. “No more political correctness,” he continued. “Political correctness can kill people.” Advocates of lower immigration levels frequently cite Australia’s merit-based system, but the country actually accepts far more immigrants as a percentage of its population than the U.S. does. Although Senate Democrats agreed to eliminate the diversity visa lottery program as part of the 2013 comprehensive immigration reform bill, there is no consensus within the party. In 2013, the Congressional Black Caucus expressed concern about plans to do away with the visas, about half of which go to people from African nations. The Uzbek population in the U.S. is relatively small, and a majority of new immigrants from the country came on diversity visas. Sixty-nine percent of Uzbek immigrants in 2010 were granted visas through the lottery, and only 2 percent came as refugees, according to analysis of government data by the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. Tuesday afternoon, in the hours after the attack, ((ul))((hl))Trump tweeted that it “looks like another attack by a very sick and deranged person.”((/hl))((/ul)) He then appeared to suggest the event may be linked to the militant group that calls itself the Islamic State, which has not yet been found to have any connection to the attack. At least eight people were killed and 12 were injured after a man drove a Home Depot rental truck down a bike path on the West Side Highway, striking several people. The driver also rammed the truck into a school bus. Saipov, who was injured in the attack, was later taken into police custody.

Whether these many apparent disagreements are deep and irresolvable, I believe ((ul))there is((/ul)) at least ((ul))one thing((/ul)) ((ul))it is reasonable to agree on((/ul)) right now, ((ul))((hl))whatever((/hl))((/ul)) general ((ul))((hl))moral view we adopt((/hl))((/ul)): that ((ul))it is((/ul)) very ((ul))((hl))important to reduce((/hl))((/ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((ul))the risk that((/ul)) all intelligent ((ul))beings((/ul)) on this planet ((ul))are eliminated by((/ul)) an enormous ((ul))((hl))catastrophe((/hl))((/ul)), such as a nuclear war. How we might in fact try to reduce such existential risks is discussed elsewhere. My claim here is only that ((ul))we ((/ul))– ((ul))whether we’re consequentialists, deontologists, or virtue ethicists((/ul)) – ((ul))should all agree that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))we should try ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))to save the world((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) According to consequentialism, we should maximize the good, where this is taken to be the goodness, from an impartial perspective, of outcomes. Clearly one thing that makes an outcome good is that the people in it are doing well. There is little disagreement here. If the happiness or well-being of possible future people is just as important as that of people who already exist, and if they would have good lives, it is not hard to see how reducing existential risk is easily the most important thing in the whole world. This is for the familiar reason that there are so many people who could exist in the future – there are trillions upon trillions… upon trillions. ((ul))There are so many possible future people that reducing existential risk is arguably the most important thing in the world((/ul)), even if the well-being of these possible people were given only 0.001% as much weight as that of existing people. ((ul))Even on a wholly person-affecting view((/ul)) – according to which there’s nothing (apart from effects on existing people) to be said in favor of creating happy people – ((ul))the case for reducing existential risk is very strong((/ul)). As noted in this seminal paper, this case is strengthened by the fact that there’s a good chance that many existing people will, with the aid of life-extension technology, live very long and very high quality lives. ((ul))You might think what I have just argued applies to consequentialists only.((/ul)) ((ul))There is a tendency to assume that, if an argument appeals to consequentialist considerations((/ul)) (the goodness of outcomes), ((ul))it is irrelevant to non-consequentialists((/ul)). ((ul))But that is a huge mistake((/ul)). ((ul))Non-consequentialism is the view that there’s more that determines rightness((/ul)) ((ul))than((/ul)) the goodness of ((ul))consequences ((/ul))or outcomes; ((ul))it is not the view that the latter don’t matter((/ul)). ((ul))Even ((/ul))John ((ul))Rawls wrote, “((/ul))((ul))((hl))All ethical doctrines worth our attention take consequences into account((/hl))((/ul)) in judging rightness. ((ul))One which did not would simply be irrational((/ul)), crazy.” ((ul))Minimally plausible versions of deontology and virtue ethics must be concerned in part with promoting the good, from an impartial point of view((/ul)). ((ul))They’d thus imply ((/ul))((ul))very strong reasons((/ul))((ul)) to reduce existential risk((/ul)), at least when this doesn’t significantly involve doing harm to others or damaging one’s character. What’s even more surprising, perhaps, is that even if our own good (or that of those near and dear to us) has much greater weight than goodness from the impartial “point of view of the universe,” indeed even if the latter is entirely morally irrelevant, we may nonetheless have very strong reasons to reduce existential risk. ((ul))Even egoism((/ul)), the view that each agent should maximize her own good, ((ul))might imply strong reasons to reduce existential risk. ((/ul))It will depend, among other things, on what one’s own good consists in. If well-being consisted in pleasure only, it is somewhat harder to argue that egoism would imply strong reasons to reduce existential risk – perhaps we could argue that one would maximize her expected hedonic well-being by funding life extension technology or by having herself cryogenically frozen at the time of her bodily death as well as giving money to reduce existential risk (so that there is a world for her to live in!). I am not sure, however, how strong the reasons to do this would be. But views which imply that, if I don’t care about other people, I have no or very little reason to help them are not even minimally plausible views (in addition to hedonistic egoism, I here have in mind views that imply that one has no reason to perform an act unless one actually desires to do that act). To be minimally plausible, egoism will need to be paired with a more sophisticated account of well-being. To see this, it is enough to consider, as Plato did, the possibility of a ring of invisibility – suppose that, while wearing it, Ayn could derive some pleasure by helping the poor, but instead could derive just a bit more by severely harming them. Hedonistic egoism would absurdly imply she should do the latter. To avoid this implication, egoists would need to build something like the meaningfulness of a life into well-being, in some robust way, where this would to a significant extent be a function of other-regarding concerns (see chapter 12 of this classic intro to ethics). But once these elements are included, we can (roughly, as above) argue that this sort of egoism will imply strong reasons to reduce existential risk. Add to all of this Samuel Scheffler’s recent intriguing arguments (quick podcast version available here) that ((ul))((hl))most of what makes our lives go well would be undermined if there were no future generations((/hl))((/ul)) of intelligent persons. On his view, my life would contain vastly less well-being if (say) a year after my death the world came to an end. ((ul))So obviously((/ul)) if Scheffler were right ((ul))I’d have very strong reason to reduce existential risk((/ul)). ((ul))We should also ((/ul))((ul))take into account((/ul))((ul)) moral uncertainty.((/ul)) W((ul))hat is it reasonable for one to do, when one is uncertain((/ul)) not (only((ul))) about((/ul)) the empirical facts, but also about the ((ul))moral facts?((/ul)) I’ve just argued that there’s agreement among minimally plausible ethical views that we have strong reason to reduce existential risk – not only consequentialists, but also deontologists, virtue ethicists, and sophisticated egoists should agree. But even ((ul))those ((/ul))(hedonistic egoists) ((ul))who disagree should have a significant level of confidence that they are mistaken,((/ul)) and that one of the above views is correct. ((ul))Even if they were 90% sure that their view is the correct one((/ul)) (and 10% sure that one of these other ones is correct), ((ul))they would have ((/ul))((ul))pretty ((/ul))((ul))((hl))strong((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) reason, from the standpoint of moral uncertainty, to reduce existential risk((/hl))((/ul)). Perhaps most disturbingly still, ((ul))even if we are only 1% sure that the well-being of possible future people matters((/ul)), it is at least arguable that, from the standpoint of moral uncertainty, ((ul))((hl))reducing existential risk is the most important thing in the world((/hl))((/ul)). Again, this is largely ((ul))for the reason that((/ul))((ul)) there are so many people who could exist in the future –((/ul)) there are trillions upon trillions… upon trillions. (For more on this and other related issues, see this excellent dissertation((ul))). Of course, it is uncertain whether these untold trillions would, in general, have good lives((/ul)). It’s possible they’ll be miserable((ul)). It is enough((/ul)) for my claim ((ul))that there is moral agreement in the relevant sense if, at least given certain empirical claims about what future lives would most likely be like, all minimally plausible moral views would converge on the conclusion that we should try to save the world((/ul)). While there are some non-crazy views that place significantly greater moral weight on avoiding suffering than on promoting happiness, for reasons others have offered (and for independent reasons I won’t get into here unless requested to), they nonetheless seem to be fairly implausible views. And ((ul))even if things did not go well for our ancestors, I am optimistic that they will overall go fantastically well for our descendants, if we allow them to((/ul)). I suspect that ((ul))most of us alive today((/ul)) – at least those of us not suffering from extreme illness or poverty – ((ul))have lives that are well worth living, and that things will continue to improve((/ul)). Derek Parfit, whose work has emphasized future generations as well as agreement in ethics, described our situation clearly and accurately: “We live during the hinge of history. Given the scientific and technological discoveries of the last two centuries, the world has never changed as fast. We shall soon have even greater powers to transform, not only our surroundings, but ourselves and our successors. If we act wisely in the next few centuries, humanity will survive its most dangerous and decisive period. Our descendants could, if necessary, go elsewhere, spreading through this galaxy…. Our descendants might, I believe, make the further future very good. But that good future may also depend in part on us. If our selfish recklessness ends human history, we would be acting very wrongly.” (From chapter 36 of On What Matters)"],"stats":{"highlightedWords":66}},{"tag":"Predictions are possible and useful","cite":"Mearsheimer, 01  (John, professor of political science at the University of Chicago, ((ul))The Tragedy of Great Power Politic((/ul))s, 2001  p. 8, googleprint)","text":["As a result, ((ul))all political forecasting is bound to include some error((/ul)).

Rudy professor of Political Science and director of the Center for the Study of Democracy and Public Life at Indiana University, Bloomington, “Ends, Means and politics,” Dissent, Spring) – <^.^>","As writers such as Niccolo Machiavelli, Max Weber, Reinhold Niebuhr, and Hannah Arendt have taught, an unyielding concern with moral goodness undercuts political responsibility. The concern may be morally laudable, reflecting a kind of personal integrity, but it suffers from three fatal flaws: (1) It fails to see that the purity of one’s intention does not ensure the achievement of what one intends. Abjuring violence or refusing to make common cause with morally compromised parties may seem like the right thing; but if such tactics entail impotence, then it is hard to view them as serving any moral good beyond the clean conscience of their supporters; (2) it fails to see that in a world of real violence and injustice, moral purity is not simply a form of powerlessness; it is often a form of complicity in injustice. This is why, from the standpoint of politics— as opposed to religion—pacifism is always a potentially immoral stand. In categorically repudiating violence, it refuses in principle to oppose certain violent injustices with any effect; and (3) it fails to see that politics is as much about unintended consequences as it is about intentions; it is the effects of action, rather than the motives of action, that is most significant. Just as the alignment with “good” may engender impotence, it is often the pursuit of “good” that generates evil. This is the lesson of communism in the twentieth century: it is not enough that one’s goals be sincere or idealistic; it is equally important, always, to ask about the effects of pursuing these goals and to judge these effects in pragmatic and historically contextualized ways. Moral absolutism inhibits this judgment. It alienates those who are not true believers. It promotes arrogance. And it undermines political effectiveness. ","Utilitarianism is the only moral framework and any alternative is contradictory to nuclear age","Nye, 86 (Joseph S. 1986; Phd Political Science Harvard.

When you object to the killing of possibly innocent people, you are told that civil wars do not permit moral niceties.

The self stretches towards the Other, as life stretches towards the future; neither can grasp what it stretches toward, but ((hl))it is in this hopeful and desperate, never conclusive and never abandoned stretching((/hl))((hl))‑((/hl))toward that the self is ever anew created and life ever anew lived. In the words of M. M. Bakhtin, it is only in this not‑yet accomplished world of anticipation and trial, leaning toward stubbornly an‑other Other, that life can be lived ‑ not in the world of the `events that occurred'; in the latter world, `it is impossible to live, to act responsibly; in it, I am not needed, in principle I am not there at all.\" Art, the Other, the future: what unites them, what makes them into three words vainly trying to grasp the same mystery, is the modality of possibility. A curious modality, at home neither in ontology nor epistemology; itself, like that which it tries to catch in its net, `always outside', forever `otherwise than being'. The possibility we are talking about here is not the all‑too‑familiar unsure‑of‑itself, and through that uncertainty flawed, inferior and incomplete being, disdainfully dismissed by triumphant existence as `mere possibility', `just a possibility'; possibility is instead `plus que la reahte' ‑ both the origin and the foundation of being. The hope, says Blanchot, proclaims the possibility of that which evades the possible; `in its limit, this is the hope of the bond recaptured where it is now lost.\"' The hope is always the hope of being fu filled, but what keeps the hope alive and so keeps the being open and on the move is precisely its unfu filment. One may say that the paradox of hope (and the paradox of possibility founded in hope) is that it may pursue its destination solely through betraying its nature; the most exuberant of energies expends itself in the urge towards rest. Possibility uses up its openness in search of closure. Its image of the better being is its own impoverishment . . . The togetherness of the being‑for is cut out of the same block; it shares in the paradoxical lot of all possibility. It lasts as long as it is unfulfilled, yet it uses itself up in never ending effort of fulfilment, of recapturing the bond, making it tight and immune to all future temptations. In an important, perhaps decisive sense, it is selfdestructive and self‑defeating: its triumph is its death. The Other, like restless and unpredictable art, like the future itself, is a mystery. And being‑for‑the‑Other, going towards the Other through the twisted and rocky gorge of affection, brings that mystery into view ‑ makes it into a challenge. That mystery is what has triggered the sentiment in the first place ‑ but cracking that mystery is what the resulting movement is about. The mystery must be unpacked so that the being‑for may focus on the Other: one needs to know what to focus on. (The `demand' is unspoken, the responsibility undertaken is unconditional; it is up to him or her who follows the demand and takes up the responsibility to decide what the following of that demand and carrying out of that responsibility means in practical terms.) Mystery ‑ noted Max Frisch ‑ (and the Other is a mystery), is an exciting puzzle, but one tends to get tired of that excitement. `And so one creates for oneself an image. This is a loveless act, the betrayal.\" Creating an image of the Other leads to the substitution of the image for the Other; the Other is now fixed ‑ soothingly and comfortingly. There is nothing to be excited about anymore. I know what the Other needs, I know where my responsibility starts and ends. Whatever the Other may now do will be taken down and used against him. What used to be received as an exciting surprise now looks more like perversion; what used to be adored as exhilarating creativity now feels like wicked levity. Thanatos has taken over from Eros, and the excitement of the ungraspable turned into the dullness and tedium of the grasped. But, as Gyorgy Lukacs observed, `everything one person may know about another is only expectation, only potentiality, only wish or fear, acquiring reality only as a result of what happens later, and this reality, too, dissolves straightaway into potentialities'. ((hl))Only death, with its finality and irreversibility, puts an end to((/hl)) the musical‑chairs game of ((hl))the real and the potential((/hl)) ‑ it once and for all closes the embrace of togetherness which was before invitingly open and tempted the lonely self.\" `Creating an image' is the dress rehearsal of that death. But creating an image is the inner urge, the constant temptation, the must of all affection . . . It is the loneliness of being abandoned to an unresolvable ambivalence and an unanchored and formless sentiment which sets in motion the togetherness of being‑for. But what loneliness seeks in togetherness is an end to its present condition ‑ an end to itself. Without knowing ‑ without being capable of knowing ‑ that the hope to replace the vexing loneliness with togetherness is founded solely on its own unfulfilment, and that once loneliness is no more, the togetherness ( the being‑for togetherness) must also collapse, as it cannot survive its own completion. What the loneliness seeks in togetherness (suicidally for its own cravings) is the foreclosing and pre‑empting of the future, cancelling the future before it comes, robbing it of mystery but also of the possibility with which it is pregnant. Unknowingly yet necessarily, it seeks it all to its own detriment, since the success (if there is a success) may only bring it back to where it started and to the condition which prompted it to start on the journey in the first place. The togetherness of being‑for is always in the future, and nowhere else. It is no more once the self proclaims: `I have arrived', `I have done it', `I fulfilled my duty.' The being‑for starts from the realization of the bottomlessness of the task, and ends with the declaration that the infinity has been exhausted. This is the tragedy of being‑for ‑ the reason why it cannot but be death‑bound while simultaneously remaining an undying attraction. In this tragedy, there are many happy moments, but no happy end. ((hl))Death is always the foreclosure of possibilities((/hl)), and it comes eventually in its own time, even if not brought forward by the impatience of love. The catch is to direct the affection to staving off the end, and to do this against the affection's nature. What follows is that, if moral relationship is grounded in the being-for togetherness (as it is), then it can exist as a project, and guide the self's conduct only as long as its nature of a project (a not yet-completed project) is not denied. Morality, like the future itself, is forever not‑yet. (And this is why the ethical code, any ethical code, the more so the more perfect it is by its own standards, supports morality the way the rope supports the hanged man.) It is because of our loneliness that we crave togetherness. It is because of our loneliness that we open up to the Other and allow the Other to open up to us. It is because of our loneliness (which is only belied, not overcome, by the hubbub of the being‑with) that we turn into moral selves. And ((hl))it is only through allowing the togetherness its possibilities which only the future can disclose that we stand a chance of acting morally((/hl)), and sometimes even of being good, ((hl))in the present((/hl))."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":65}},{"tag":"((ul))Escaping to the U.S. will land the women in more abusive situations ((/ul))","cite":"((ul))YWCA 2017((/ul))","text":["((ul))((hl))Newly - arrived immigrant survivors may face((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) additional forms of ((/ul))((ul))((hl))abuse that women((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) of color and Native women born ((/ul))((ul))((hl))in((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))U((/hl))((/ul))((ul))nited ((/ul))((ul))((hl))S((/hl))((/ul))((ul))tates ((/ul))((ul))((hl))may not, including((/hl))((/ul))((ul)):  ((/ul))((ul))((hl))threats of deportation((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) despite immigration status, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))possible language barriers, lack of knowledge of the((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) American ((/ul))((ul))((hl))legal system((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), ((/ul))((ul))((hl))threatening to report employment status if survivor works \"under the table\"((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), ((/ul))((ul))((hl))threatening to deport her and keeping the children((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), withdrawal of petition to complete legalization status, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))intimidation by destroying((/hl))((/ul)) important documents such as an ((ul))((hl))identification card or passport((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).

This data, the Implied Relative Risk Aversion (IRRA) can be factored into an economic forecast. An option is a contract that gives the buyer the right to buy or sell an underlying security at a specified price on a specified date. Using the OptionMetrics Ivy DB databases (academia’s definitive source of historical options pricing data) for the most liquid of stock index options contracts, those that trade based on the S&P 500 Index SPX, -0.07% we found Implied Relative Risk Aversion outperforms existing economic indicators once it is used in conjunction with them. A decrease in IRRA predicts an increase in economic growth because investors boost investments when they become less risk averse. Conversely, an increase in risk aversion points to a slowdown in growth because investors lower investments when they become more risk averse. Implied Relative Risk Aversion is currently quite low, at 3.6 for May, after readings of 3.7 in April and March, implying that traders in the S&P 500 options market anticipate an increase in U.S. economic growth. The last pop in IRRA occurred in December 2013, as seen in the accompanying graph (above), when IRRA hit 6.8. Shortly afterward, the U.S. economy contracted by 0.9% in the first quarter of 2014. Even more revealing, in the second half of 2007 IRRA rose sharply in anticipation of the recession’s beginning in December of that year. IRRA reached its historic peak of 9.3 in February 2008. Afterward, the depths of the Great Recession followed, with four consecutive quarters of negative gross domestic product (GDP).

But to many of the country’s trading partners, the president’s criticisms ring hollow given that the United States places its own tariffs on everything from trucks and peanuts to sugar and stilettos. “While the system has problems, it is in no way ‘unfair,’ to the U.S., which as a hegemon has set the rules and the exceptions to the rules,” said Susan Aaronson, a professor at George Washington University’s Elliott School of International Affairs. The United States has long been the biggest champion of global trade, viewing the opening of borders as essential to strengthening not only its economy but the global economy as well. It led the way in building the international trading order in the 20th century, rising to become the world’s predominant economy. Tariffs were used as a way to offer protection for certain industries, but free trade was considered the tide that would lift all boats because all countries involved would benefit. Instead of viewing trade as a mutually beneficial relationship, the president has described trading relationships as a zero-sum game, in which the United States loses out when other countries have more favorable terms. Mr. Trump has seized on trade policy to prop up industries that he has promised to revitalize, such as manufacturing, by limiting foreign competition. Many of the United States’ tariffs were put in place to protect influential industries that lobbied the government to set high barriers to foreign products, including a 25 percent tariff on sugar and foreign trucks, and a 163 percent tariff on imported peanuts. Mr. Trump has singled out specific products where American producers face barriers, like Canada’s 270 percent tariff on imported milk and Europe’s 10 percent tariffs on American cars. On Saturday night, as Mr. Trump left the Group of 7 summit meeting en route to Singapore for a meeting with North Korea, he lashed out at Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada once again for his country’s dairy tariffs and for his criticisms of Mr. Trump’s trade measures. “Very dishonest & weak,” Mr. Trump wrote in a tweet aboard Air Force One. “Our Tariffs are in response to his of 270% on dairy!” But on average, American tariffs are on par with those of other rich, developed countries, which tend to be low, according to the World Bank and the United Nations. Among the developed nations that make up the Group of 7 that met in a resort town near Quebec City this weekend, the United States has tariffs that are slightly ((ul))higher, on average, across all its imported products((/ul)) than Canada or Japan and exactly equivalent to the four European nations in the G-7. So far this year, Mr. ((ul))T((/ul))((ul))((hl))rump has imposed tariffs on nearly $60 billion of steel, aluminum, solar products and washing machines that flow into the United States ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))from around the world. He is threatening additional tariffs on foreign goods that would expand his trade penalties significantly, including a tariff on $350 billion of imported automobiles and parts and levies on $150 billion worth of Chinese goods((/ul)), on the assumption those will force trading partners to drop their own barriers to entry. ((ul))((hl))The approach risks upending((/hl))((/ul)) the United States’ longstanding embrace of free ((ul))((hl))trade((/hl))((/ul)) and its use of trading relationships to help power economic growth in the United States ((ul))((hl))and the world economy writ large((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) Since the Second World War, the United States has cut its tariff rates in step with other developed countries. It also gave some less-developed countries access to its markets, with the idea of increasing wages and improving quality of life. Mr. Trump appears ready to change that equation and increasingly views every country as a threat, regardless of its economic strength.

In the year ahead, hefty tax cuts, particularly for businesses, are expected to encourage more investment and spending, although many economists predict ballooning deficits will overtake the positive effects in the longer term. One-time quirks that could affect growth measurements this year could also end up artificially pumping 2018’s figures. Even analysts with ambitious forecasts for the next year, however, agree that the United States is unlikely to sustain annual growth of much more than 2 percent given a smaller, aging work force; sluggish productivity growth; and soaring deficits. “((ul))The economy’s sustainable trend is around 2 percent,((/ul))” Mr. Prakken said. The Commerce Department’s report on the gross domestic product — which showed growth for all of last year at 2.3 percent — is a rough draft. The fourth-quarter estimate will be revised twice in the next couple of months, and it could increase or drop by as much as a percentage point, based on previous recalculations. After all, government statisticians have to put together the fourth-quarter estimate without complete data on construction, trade and inventories.

The president ticked off those items on Friday when he hailed America’s economic strength at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, where global leaders have been sharing encouraging economic news all week. The American economy recovered from a plodding start in the first three months of 2017, when sharp cuts in consumer spending limited G.D.P. growth to 1.2 percent on an annualized basis. It sprang back over the next six months, with the rate reaching 3.1 percent in the second quarter and 3.2 percent in the third. In the fourth quarter, holiday shoppers were enthusiastic, and spending on business and residential housing was up. A persistent appetite for foreign goods continued to widen the trade deficit — it reached nearly $72 billion for goods alone in December — and dragged down gains. But inventory declines that detracted from G.D.P. last quarter should rebound over the next as businesses refill empty shelves. The American economy’s performance has also been buoyed by simultaneous growth in nations around the world, which has fueled trade and enabled foreign consumers to buy more American-made products."," "],"stats":{"highlightedWords":55}},{"tag":"Growth is resilient---wage growth, massive investment, and tax cuts","cite":"TCB 18 (The Conference Board, a global, independent business membership and research association working in the public interest, 2/14/18, “The Conference Board Economic Forecast for the U.S. Economy,” https://www.conference-board.org/data/usforecast.cfm)","text":["Volatility has returned to the economy with a vengeance.

Mattis looked at all of the senior military officers in the department and said, ‘I want you to think and operate every day as though we’re at war next week….You need to be thinking that things can go south in an hurry and we’ll have to respond regardless of the state of our forces.”","Two Traps","As the White House, Congress, and the Pentagon struggle to restore the US military’s readiness for war, Work said, they must avoid two great traps. First, he said, ((ul))we can’t let the insatiable demands of the theater combatant commanders((/ul)) (COCOMs) ((ul))siphon off forces from the vital task of deterring rival nation-states((/ul)), above all Russia and China.

Deterring the Soviet Union by standing ready to fight it – primarily with conventional forces in Europe, but with nukes if necessary – was unambiguously number one. Readiness to respond to lesser crises such as Vietnam came second. “Shaping” operations to advance peace, stability, and democracy around the world came a distant third. In the years of US unipolar dominance after the fall of the Berlin Wall, however, those priorities reversed, until shaping become the dominant mission in both official doctrine and operational practice.","So even as Central Command waged two prolonged wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, ((ul))CENTCOM and other COCOMs kept up an intense pace of operations to take out terrorists, train local partners, respond to disasters, and generally show the flag((/ul)). In fact, the way the Defense Department works, ((ul))COCOM commanders could make unlimited demands without paying any of the cost, leaving it to Pentagon planners and the overstretched services to figure out how to meet them.((/ul))","((ul))The result, Work said, has been a terrible erosion of readiness to fight an actual war.((/ul))","Modernization vs. COCOMs","The Japan-based 7th Fleet, for example, was waiving certifications on training to get ships out to sea for “presence” patrols, contributing to two deadly accidents.

Defense Secretary Mattis has put readiness as priority No. 1 across the board. So there are signs this mindset is taking root in the Trump administration.","Work’s other key argument, however, may be less welcome in Washington. “((ul))Before substantially increasing the size of the joint force, I would argue, hone the force we have((/ul)),” he said.

Now, ((/hl))((ul))((hl))successful wars seem to be an endangered species.((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))From the days of Assyria and Rome, great empires were usually built through war, and elites in 1914 had plenty of recent examples for the huge profits a successful war can bring. In 1846–48 the United States invaded Mexico, and for the price of 13,000 dead American soldiers, it got California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico and parts of Colorado, Kansas, Wyoming and Oklahoma. It was the bargain of the millennium. Similarly, imperial Japan cherished its victories over China and Russia; Germany glorified its triumph over France; and almost every great power had a string of splendid little colonial wars to its name. When France, Britain or Italy contemplated putting boots on the ground in Vietnam, Nigeria or Libya, their main fear was that somebody else might get there first. ((ul))In 2017, global elites don’t know what a successful war even looks like((/ul)). They may have read about them in history books and seen fanciful recreations in Hollywood blockbusters, but ((ul))they have good reason to suspect that this type of war has gone extinct.((/ul)) ((ul))((hl))Though some((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) third-world ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))dictators((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) and non-state actors still manage to ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))flourish through war,((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) it seems that ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))major powers no longer know how to do so. ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))The greatest victory in living memory — of the United States over the Soviet Union — was achieved without any major military confrontation((/ul)). The U.S. then got a fleeting taste of old-fashioned military glory in the First Gulf War — which only tempted it to waste trillions on humiliating military fiascos in Iraq and Afghanistan. ((ul))((hl))China, the rising power of the early twenty-first century, has assiduously avoided all armed conflicts((/hl))((/ul)) since its Vietnamese debacle of 1979, and it owes its ascent strictly to economic factors. In this, it has emulated not the Japanese and German empires of the pre-1914 era, but rather the nonviolent Japanese and German economic miracles of the post-1945 era. ((ul))Even in the Middle East, regional powers don’t know how to wage successful((/ul)) ((ul))wars((/ul)). ((ul))Iran gained nothing from the long bloodbath of the Iran-Iraq War and subsequently avoided all direct military confrontations.((/ul)) It became regional hegemon by default, as its two main enemies — the U.S. and Iraq — got embroiled in a war that destroyed both Iraq and the American appetite for Middle Eastern quagmires. Much the same can be said of Israel, which waged its last successful war fifty years ago. Since 1967, ((ul))Israel has prospered despite its many wars, not thanks to them((/ul)). Its conquered territories are a heavy economic burden and a crippling political liability. Like Iran, Israel has recently improved its geopolitical position not by waging successful wars, but by avoiding getting sucked into the wars that devastated Iraq, Syria and Libya. ((ul))The only recent successful war waged by a major power has been the Russian conquest of the Crimea. However, it was made possible by an extraordinary set of circumstances:((/ul)) ((ul))The Ukrainian army showed no resistance; other powers refrained from intervening; and the Crimean population either supported the invaders or peacefully accepted the conquest as a fait accompli((/ul)). These circumstances will be hard to reproduce. If the precondition for a successful war is the absence of any enemies willing to resist, it limits the available opportunities. ((ul))Indeed, when Russia sought to reproduce its Crimean success in other parts of the Ukraine, it encountered substantially stiffer opposition, and the war in eastern Ukraine bogged down into an unproductive stalemate.((/ul)) Conquering decrepit Soviet-era factories in Luhansk and Donetsk hardly pays for the war, and it certainly does not offset the costs of international sanctions. The conquest of Crimea notwithstanding, it seems that ((ul))in the twenty-first century ((/ul))((ul))the most successful strategy is to keep your peace and let others do the fighting for you.((/ul))((ul)) Why has it become so difficult for major powers to wage successful wars? One reason is the change ((/ul))((ul))in the nature of the((/ul))((ul)) economy.((/ul)) In the past, ((ul))if you defeated your enemy on the battlefield, you could easily cash in by looting enemy cities, selling enemy civilians in the slave markets and occupying valuable wheat fields and gold mines. Yet in the twenty-first century, only puny profits could be made that way.((/ul)) Today, ((ul))the main economic assets consist of technical and institutional knowledge — and you cannot conquer knowledge through war.((/ul)) An organization such as ISIS may flourish by looting cities and oil wells in the Middle East — in 2014, ISIS seized more than $500 million from Iraqi banks and in 2015 made an additional $500 million from selling oil. But ((ul))((hl))China and the U.S. are unlikely to start a war for a paltry billion.((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) As for spending trillions of dollars on a war against the U.S., how could China repay these expenses and balance all the war damages and lost trade opportunities? Would the victorious People’s Liberation Army loot the riches of Silicon Valley?((/ul)) True, corporations such as Apple, Facebook and Google are worth hundreds of billions of dollars, but you cannot seize these fortunes by force. There are no silicon mines in Silicon Valley.((hl)) ((/hl))((ul))((hl))A successful war could theoretically still bring huge profits by enabling the victor to rearrange the global trade system in its favor((/hl))((/ul)), as the U.S. did after its victory over Hitler. However((ul)), ((/ul))((ul))((hl))present-day military technology would make it extremely difficult to repeat this feat.((/hl))((/ul)) By definition, ((ul))profits((/ul))((ul)) large enough to make a global war worthwhile for the victor will also make it worthwhile for the loser to resort to weapons of mass destruction.((/ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((ul))((hl))The atom bomb has turned “victory” in a World War into collective suicide((/hl))((/ul))((hl)). ((/hl))It is no coincidence that since Hiroshima ((ul))superpowers never fought one another ((/ul))((ul))directly, and((/ul))((ul)) engaged only in what((/ul)) (for them) ((ul))were low-stake conflicts in which none was tempted to use nuclear weapons to avert defeat((/ul)). Indeed, ((ul))((hl))even attacking a second-rate nuclear power((/hl))((/ul)) such as Iran or North Korea ((ul))((hl))is an extremely unattractive proposition.((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))Cyber warfare makes things even worse for would-be imperialists((/ul)). As recently as the days of George W. Bush, the U.S. could wreak havoc in far-off Fallujah while the Iraqis had no means of retaliating against San Francisco. But ((ul))if the U.S. now attacks a country possessing even moderate cyber warfare capabilities, malware and logic bombs could stop air traffic in Dallas, cause trains to collide in Philadelphia and bring down the electric grid in Michigan((/ul)). In the great age of conquerors, warfare was a low-damage, high-profit affair. At the battle of Hastings in 1066, William the Conqueror gained the whole of England in a single day for the cost of a few thousand dead. ((ul))((hl))Nuclear weapons and cyber warfare((/hl))((/ul)), by contrast((ul)), ((/ul))((ul))((hl))are high-damage, low-profit technologies((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). You could use such tools to destroy entire countries, but not to build profitable empires. ((/ul))Hence in a world filling up with saber-rattling and bad vibes, perhaps ((ul))o((/ul))((ul))((hl))ur best guarantee of peace is that major powers aren’t familiar with any recent example of a successful war((/hl))((/ul)). While Genghis Khan or Julius Caesar would invade a foreign country at the drop of a hat, ((ul))present-day strongmen talk ((/ul))((ul))loud((/ul))((ul)) but are very careful about actually launching wars((/ul)). Of course, if somebody does find a formula to wage successful wars under twenty-first-century conditions, the gates of hell might open with a rush. This is what makes the Russian success in the Crimea a particularly frightening omen. Let’s hope it remains an isolated example. Though, even if it is impossible to wage successful wars in the twenty-first century, that does not give us an absolute guarantee for peace.

Sandra Hernandez, M.D. and chief executive officer of the California Health Care Foundation (CHCF), dedicated her keynote address to this topic at the recent 10th annual Health 2.0 conference in Santa Clara, Calif. Health 2.0 is considered the premier national conference for developers in the digital health space. Oakland-based CHCF is a policy institution which also operates an innovation fund to provide seed money to promising companies. “We are aging at a very, very dramatic pace,” Hernandez said during her keynote. “Yet we are chugging along providing a workforce the same way it was designed and built 50 years ago.” Here are some stats on the growing “silver tsunami:” By 2030, the U.S. population over age 65 will grow by 55 percent. By 2030, there will be a shortfall of between 7,300 and 43,100 primary care physicians. The median age of physicians and nurses is gradually inching up, meaning a wave of retirements in the coming years. In just California, the number of seniors who have trouble caring for themselves will increase by 88 percent by 2030. By 2030, at least a million seniors will need help with self-care such as cooking, bathing and cleaning in California alone. Most people prefer to “age in place,” meaning they will require home care and retrofits to their homes. The population will continue to become more diverse, requiring culturally and linguistically appropriate care for seniors. ((ul))So how ((/ul))((ul))((hl))can technology help solve these problems of shrinking ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))healthccare((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) workforce and an aging population((/hl))((/ul))((ul))? Here are few examples((/ul)) cited by Hernandez and others during Health 2.0: ((ul))Team-based care with technology support((/ul)). An example is Quartet, a software platform that allows primary care and behavioral health providers to communicate and collaborate securely while also conducting population health management. The CHCF is an investor in Quartet. ((ul))Identifying and meeting patient social needs((/ul)). Seven out of the 17 minutes in a primary care visit is spent on social needs, Hernandez says. Examples of services that help primary care providers address patient social needs include HealthLeads and using text messages to connect patients with appropriate community services such as food banks. ((ul))Tackling social issues that contribute to poor health in the elderly. Isolation and loneliness are significant drivers of mortality((/ul)). Loneliness can have a negative impact on senior health equivalent to smoking 16 cigarettes per day, according to Robin Caruso, the first-ever chief togetherness officer at CareMore, a medical group and health plan based in California. CareMore screens its members for loneliness and then provides counseling and peer-to-peer virtual interactions. You can read more about the program here. ((ul))Voice-controlled smart personal assistants((/ul)): Investors in digital health said at Health 2.0 that they see tremendous potential for Amazon’s Alexa and Google’s Echo as platforms for at-home health care. Hands-free, voice-activated and relatively cheap, these systems can be used by providers to prompt patients to take their medications at specific times, transmit vital signs and conduct check-ins. How are your local hospitals, health plans and physician groups incorporating technology to help providers meet the needs of their aging patients?

((ul))What else should we expect from a president who promises to build a physical wall between the United States and Mexico, one of our most important trading partners and allies, simply as political bait for his ((/ul))((ul))anti-immigrant base((/ul))((ul))?((/ul)) What else should we expect from this president who insults a U.S.-born judge by declaring he could not be objective in his job simply because of his Mexican heritage? What else should we expect from a president who conjures up pernicious images of immigrants in this country, depicting them as killers, to ((ul))inflame his supporters and excite the darkest devils of their psyche?((/ul)) After all, this is a president who equates white-supremacist, neo-Nazi, racist, xenophobic, violent protesters with those who come out in support of civil rights, social justice and equality for all. Amigos, this is the man who was voted into the Oval Office by scapegoating immigrants, accusing our first African American president of being born in Kenya, and hiring well-known white nationalists as his closest advisors. Let’s be very clear. The president did not “wrestle” with this decision. ((ul))((hl))He has talked about ending DACA many times during his campaign((/hl))((/ul)). Sure, he sent mixed signals by saying he wanted to treat this issue and these kids with “great heart” but we all knew where he stood. If he truly “wrestled” with this, he simply would have shown leadership, kept DACA in place and worked with Republicans and Democrats to codify protections for Dreamers into law. After all, wasn’t this the president who boasted that only he could fix our nation’s problems? Some fix. More like a dodge. These Dreamer kids are some of the best this country has to offer. They work hard, have gone through background checks; many hold down two or three jobs to help make their families’ ends meet. Collectively, they contribute more than $460 billion to our economy in a decade. Many are summa cum laude graduates, or have fought, bled and died in our military for the exact same American values this president trampled on today so heartlessly. One Dreamer even lost his life while volunteering to save others during Hurricane Harvey. And this is how we repay them? For shame! We are better than this — though the president is not. Sadly, w((ul))hat Trump doesn’t understand is that this is not a partisan issue. This is a values issue.((/ul)) Most Americans agree that Dreamers should be allowed to stay. A majority also believes they should be given a pathway to citizenship. Even majorities of Republicans, including three-fourths of Trump voters, believe Dreamers should be allowed to stay legally in the only country they know. ((ul))((hl))Trump is doing this to placate the very narrow and narrow-minded anti-immigrant nationalist core of his base because he is so weak otherwise((/hl))((/ul)). It is as if he has given up trying to be president of the United States of America, and is seeking to preside over an even more divided America. That may ((ul))keep him popular among his dwindling base,((/ul)) but it is no way to win re-election or to give your party the edge in the upcoming midterm elections. There is a reason why so many Republicans have spoken out in defense of DACA and against the president’s draconian decision. Paul Ryan said last Friday he did not think it was something the president should do. Why are they speaking out now? Because Republicans know two things: that it will be very difficult for Congress to pass something Trump will sign, and that their party is in a perilous place if they and their president are the ones who callously threw 800,000 of our brightest students, soldiers, young entrepreneurs, community advocates and hard-working kids who are American — in every way that matters — under the bus. They also know 800,000 Latinos turn 18 every year. They realize Trump is at record-low disapproval among all Americans, and especially Latinos. Granted, the Latino vote was not enough to keep Trump from the White House in 2016. But the wave he is creating among not just Latinos, but among Americans who feel this president is a cancer on our American values, will be one that will flood the voting booths in 2018 and 2020 to get him and Republicans who stood with him out of office. It will be a wave not even Trump’s wall will be able to stop. Dreamers, America is with you. We will keep dreaming and fighting by your side.

He is a manager for a home health care service in New York City, using his Spanish language skills to help people in need.((/ul)) Back in 2001, Nicolas and his family left their home country of Peru in pursuit of creating a new life in the United States of America. \"My parents gave up completely everything, my mom had left all her family behind for us to have a life here and I am forever grateful of that,\" said Ugaz-Valencia. For years, Nicolas and his family lived in the shadows, because they lacked legal status to be in the U.S. That got in the way of opportunities that most Americans take for granted such as going to college and pursuing a career. “The biggest challenge with higher education was the finances — and going to college is super expensive here. As an undocumented person you cannot get state funding, loans, in-state tuition. You either pay out of pocket or you get a scholarship, those are really the only options,” said Ugaz-Valencia. That all began to change in 2012, when then-President Barack Obama signed an executive order creating \"Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\" or \"DACA.\" The program offers immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children legal waivers allowing them to stay and work in the country. DACA recipients must undergo background checks and are required to renew their waivers every two years. Since its inception, roughly 700,000 applicants known as \"Dreamers\" have been approved for the program, including Nicolas and his two brothers. \"((ul))((hl))Without DACA I can't work, without DACA I can't walk the streets safe thinking I'm not going to get deported,\" said ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))Ugaz((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))-Valencia. “Knowing that it was going to be disbanded I was terrified every single day.((/hl))((/ul))((ul))”((/ul)) Last fall, President Donald Trump said he would phase out the DACA program and ordered March 5th as the deadline to end it. But, a federal appeals court order has rendered that date meaningless. So, current enrollees can continue to renew their DACA status while the court decides whether the suspension can proceed. If it rules in favor of the administration, hundreds of thousands of \"Dreamers\" could be subject to deportation((ul)). “If you keep the DACA recipients in the United States and you allow them to legally work and live here, not only is that going to be a boom for the economy that is, they're going to earn more money and they're going to pay more taxes. But it's also going to grow the broader economy,” said Ike Brannon, Senior Fellow at the CATO Institute. ((/ul))Ike Brannon, a senior fellow at the CATO Institute, a libertarian think-tank in Washington D.C has studied the impact of DACA recipients on the U.S. economy. He recently co-authored a new report that forecasts the cost of reversing DACA.((ul)) \"((/ul))((ul))((hl))We expect in the next 10 years if we allow the DACA recipients to remain in the United States, that would add an extra $350 billion to the economy((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) compared to excluding them from being able to work legally.

((ul))((hl))The news was not good((/hl))((/ul)) for that legislation. The bill would direct the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to cancel removal and grant conditional lawful permanent resident (LPR) status to illegal aliens and aliens in Temporary Protected Status (TPS)) who: were physically present in this country for the four years prior to enactment; were under 18 years of age when they initially entered the United States; are not inadmissible on criminal, security, terrorism, or other grounds; are not persecutors; have not been convicted of certain federal or state offenses; and have fulfilled specified educational requirements. The bill provides a waiver for the criminal removability bars \"for humanitarian purposes or family unity or if the waiver is otherwise in the public interest.\" It would also provide for conditional lawful permanent resident status for aliens who have received Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), unless the alien had engaged in conduct rendering the alien ineligible for DACA since gaining that status. Finally, the bill provides for removal of the conditions on that LPR status, and contains a confidentiality provision barring release of information provided by applicants for conditional LPR status or DACA, subject to limited exceptions. That estimate states: CBO and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimate that ((ul))enacting((/ul)) ((ul))S. 1615((/ul)) ((ul))would increase direct spending by $26.8 billion((/ul)) over the 2018-2027 period. Over that same period, CBO and JCT estimate that the bill would increase revenues, on net, by $0.9 billion — a decline in on-budget revenues of $4.3 billion and an increase in off-budget revenues [Social Security taxes] of $5.3 billion. In total, CBO and JCT estimate that changes in direct spending and revenues from enacting S. 1615 would increase budget deficits by $25.9 billion over the 2018-2027 period, boosting on-budget deficits by $30.6 billion and decreasing off-budget deficits by $4.7 billion over that period. It also \"estimates that providing higher education assistance for newly eligible people under S. 1615 would cost $1.0 billion over the 2018-2022 period.\" As the CBO explains: The bill would affect direct spending by conferring eligibility for federal benefits — health insurance subsidies and benefits under Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), among others — provided that those applicants met the other eligibility requirements for those programs. With respect to direct spending, CBO finds that S. 1615 would increase earned income and child tax credits by $5.5 billion between 2018 and 2027. It finds that the bill would increase spending for Medicaid by $5.0 billion during that period, and would increase direct spending for SNAP benefits by $2.3 billion in that timeframe. Direct spending for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits would increase by $900 million during that 10-year period under the bill. Finally, the bill would increase Social Security spending (which is off-budget) by $600 million, and Medicare spending by $300 million between 2018 and 2027. Federal direct spending for assistance for higher education would also increase, by $500 million in that timeframe under the bill, CBO estimates. Most significantly, however, \"CBO and JCT estimate that enacting S. 1615 would increase outlays for subsidies for health insurance purchased through the marketplaces by $11.8 billion over the 2018-2027 period.\" In reaching the $0.9 billion revenue increase figure, CBO assumes that more employees would work \"on the books\", and therefore report their income, increasing revenue, \"mostly in the form of Social Security taxes, which are categorized as off-budget.\" It finds, however, that \"increased reporting of employment income would result in increases in tax deductions by businesses. ... As a result, corporations would report lower taxable profits and pay less in income taxes.\" In addition: \"Noncorporate businesses, such as partnerships and sole proprietorships, also would report lower taxable income, which would decrease individual income taxes paid by the partners and owners.\" Finally: CBO and JCT estimate that there would be a $1.2 billion decrease in revenues over the 2018-2027 period associated with increases in the nonrefundable portion of the premium assistance tax credit provided through the health insurance marketplaces established under the Affordable Care Act. Therefore, CBO concludes, the increases in revenues \"would be mostly offset\" by the decreases. In the longer run: CBO estimates that enacting S. 1615 would increase net direct spending by more than $2.5 billion and on-budget deficits by more than $5 billion in at least one of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2028. Several factors would drive an increase in spending on federal benefits: ((ul))The direct beneficiaries((/ul)) of S. 1615 ((ul))would continue to naturalize((/ul)), ((ul))making them eligible to sponsor immediate relatives for LPR status without an annual limit. ((/ul))The later recipients of conditional LPR status and all family-sponsored legal permanent residents would exceed five years in LPR status, conferring eligibility for full Medicaid benefits and SNAP.

((ul))Both the direct beneficiaries((/ul)) of S. 1615 ((ul))and their family members((/ul)) who later receive LPR status ((ul))would((/ul)) pay enough years of payroll taxes to ((ul))become eligible for Social Security and Medicare.((/ul)) In reaching these conclusions, CBO estimates that 3.25 million aliens would potentially be eligible for conditional lawful permanent resident status, but that not all of them will apply for that status or be approved. Consequently, CBO estimates that approximately two million aliens would be granted conditional lawful permanent resident status under that bill. Conditions would be removed for 1.6 million of those aliens, and \"roughly 1 million of the 1.6 million people receiving unconditional LPR status would become naturalized U.S. citizens during the 2018-2027 period, and that a substantial number of people would naturalize in the following decades.\" ((ul))((hl))Needless to say((/hl))((/ul))((hl)), ((/hl))((ul))((hl))S.((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) 1615 will have a significant effect on the federal deficit((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).

((ul))These results are consistent with altruistic behavior depicted in the model - immigrants with children who have higher levels of schooling are less likely to remit to their children and, if they do, the transfer amount is lower.

((ul))However, it is notable that the higher the proportion of the immigrant’s children resident in the United States, who face a significantly higher skill price, the less likely is the parent to provide a transfer and the lower the levels of transfers.8 Finally, again consistent with altruism, parents with higher levels of schooling, given their children’s characteristics, are more likely to remit and remit more and those with no earnings remit less. The coefficient on actual parental earnings also has a positive sign, but it is not estimated precisely((/ul)).","((ul))We now look at estimates of the probability that an individual child of the immigrant respondent and who is age 17 and above receives a transfer from the parent((/ul)), based on the subsample of 1,918 children who are neither citizens nor residents of the United States.

As a result, ((ul))many rural households tend to reduce risk by diversifying into activities with lower covariate risk to make consumption and incomes less volatile((/ul)). It was also observed within the transitional and Guinea ecological zones of the study area that many non-farming income activities tend to peak during the dry seasons when there is a decline in farm activities, which forces smallholder farmers to diversify their labour. However, it is remittance-recipient households that are more capable of engaging in other incomegenerating activities such as livestock rearing and marketing and retailing during the offseason. The use of remittances to invest in various productive activities such as risk diversification mechanism also confirms some previous studies that are of the opinion that remittances can be counter-cyclical, which could be used to invest in physical and human capital (Cooray and Mallick, 2013).","4.6.3 Financing climate change-induced incremental cost related to infrastructure.","((ul))((hl))Remittance recipients’ households have on many occasions used their funds to improve or reconstruct their ageing houses and canoes or build new infrastructure ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))in an attempt to((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) boost their adaptive capacity against the impact of climate change((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).

Similarly, surveying 11 countries from SAA, Maddison (2007) noted that significant numbers of rural people are aware that climate is changing and therefore find a way to adapt, accommodate or retreat. Evidence from the data also confirms that successful transition from hard-hit disaster homes to a healthy and resilient home in the study areas largely depended on access to remittances.

This paper discusses options for increasing the resilience of food supplies to these risks. In contrast to local catastrophes, global food supply catastrophes cannot be addressed via food aid from external locations. Three options for food supply resilience are identified: food stockpiles, agriculture, and foods produced from alternative (non-sunlight) energy sources including biomass and fossil fuels. Each of these three options has certain advantages and disadvantages. Stockpiles are versatile but expensive. Agriculture is efficient but less viable in certain catastrophe scenarios. Alternative foods are inexpensive pre-catastrophe but need to be scaled up post-catastrophe and may face issues of social acceptability. The optimal portfolio of food options will typically include some of each and will additionally vary by location as regions vary in population and access to food input resources. Furthermore, if the catastrophe shuts down transportation, then resilience requires local self-sufficiency in food. Food supply resilience requires not just the food itself, but also the accompanying systems of food production and distribution. Overall, increasing food supply resilience can play an important role in global catastrophic risk reduction. However, it is unwise to attempt maximizing food supply resilience, because doing so comes at the expense of other important objectives, including catastrophe prevention. Taking all these issues into account, the paper proposes a research agenda for analysis of specific food supply resilience decisions.","1 Introduction","Human civilization is threatened by a range of global catastrophic risks. The severity of such catastrophes is so large (indeed, it may be infinite) that these risks are important even if their probability is low. And so, scholars over several decades have argued that reducing these risks should be an important priority for society today (e.g., Sagan 1983; Ng 1991; Bostrom 2002; Beckstead 2013).1","Several known global ((ul))((hl))catastrophic risks cause harm to human civilization by disrupting global food supplies, threatening severe global food security crises((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).((/hl)) Volcanic eruptions, asteroid and comet impacts, and nuclear wars all send particulate matter into the stratosphere. The particles spread globally, blocking incoming sunlight, rapidly lowering surface temperatures and reducing precipitation, and in turn lowering agricultural yields (Robock et al. 2009; Xia et al. 2015). A rapid increase in surface temperatures can follow from the abrupt cessation of stratospheric geoengineering, a technology proposed in response to global warming (e.g., Matthews and Caldeira 2007);2 this rapid warming could have similarly harmful agricultural effects. Even without geoengineering, natural ((ul))climate change could also be abrupt((/ul)) (Lenton et al. 2008; Valdes 2011). Plant pathogens and invasive species, including novel organisms produced through biotechnology, could destroy major classes of crops (Dudley and Woodford 2002; Mann 1999; Saigo 2000). There may ((ul))be additional risks to global food supplies that have not yet been identified. These unknown risks could relate to environmental change, emerging technologies, and/or some other force((/ul)).3 Because so many known global catastrophic risks impair food supplies, it is likely that unknown global catastrophic risks would as well. Collectively, these risks make ((ul))risks to food supplies one of the largest classes of global catastrophic risk((/ul)).","((ul))Ideally, these catastrophes would be prevented, such that there would be no major loss of food. ((/ul))To the extent that these catastrophes can be prevented, efforts to prevent them should be made. However, such efforts may not succeed. Furthermore, some of the risks, such as volcanic eruptions, cannot readily be prevented. Finally, the unknown risks, if there are any, potentially could be prevented, but it is not known how to do so. For these reasons((ul)), it is possible that a global food supply catastrophe will occur((/ul)), despite efforts made to prevent it.","((ul))((hl))The prospect of global food supply catastrophe suggests a role for increasing civilization’s resilience to such catastrophes((/hl))((/ul)). ((ul))Resilience can be defined as “the ability to prepare and plan for, absorb, recover from, and more successfully adapt to adverse events” ((/ul))(NAS 2012:1).

Indeed, disappointing experiences with previous adaptation financing regimes cast doubt on the effectiveness of the highly touted 100 billion new pledge that emerged from Paris in 2015. ((/ul))Similarly, ((ul))given the level of corruption and institutional failure in many parts of SAA, there are likelihoods that proceeds from the US$100bn and other similar public financial resources aimed at tackling adaptation to climate change are likely not to reach those who critically need adaptation suppor((/ul))t.

Specifically, this study found that significant parts of remittances are used for consumptive purposes compared to investment in stock adaptation projects (infrastructure and investment portfolios). Additionally, it noted that household that invest remittance income in climate resilient enterprises is more likely to reduce their exposure to climate risk over an extended period compared to those that pend their on smotthing their consumption. The study further found that ((ul))remittances could help close the financial exclusion gaps given the fact that some recipients save their funds with microfinance institutions.((/ul)) Again, there is evidence that ((ul))remittances absorb part of the economic losses owing to climate-related natural disasters, thereby lessening relief service required from local and central government.((/ul))"],"stats":{"highlightedWords":58}},{"tag":"Increases in remittances empirically correlate to declining fertility","cite":"Naufal, 15 – Assistant Research Scientist at the Public Policy Research Institute (PPRI) at Texas A&M University (George S., November 2015, \"Impact of remittances on fertility,\" IZA World of Labor 2015: 207, DOA: 6-26-2018 ) //SS","text":["ELEVATOR PITCH ","((ul))((hl))The growth in the number and in the size of remittances((/hl))((/ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((ul))((hl))and the stability of these monetary transfers have made them((/hl))((/ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((ul))((hl))a prime target for policymakers((/hl))((/ul)).

According to National Wildlife Federation, in a report titled Population and the Environment, “nearly 20 plant and animal species become extinct every hour” (Effects of Overpopulation).","Along with fueling massive animal extinction, ((ul))population growth((/ul))((ul)) contributes heavily to ((/ul))((ul))habitat loss((/ul)). Around the world, in low-density regions as well as in high-density ones, ((ul))population pressures create incentive to clear and develop land, ((/ul))((ul))in particular forests((/ul)). ((ul))Deforestation((/ul))((ul)) not only eliminates land and ((/ul))((ul))destroys ecosystems((/ul))((ul)), but also fragments and changes many animals’ migration patterns and makes them easier targets for poachers. ((/ul))In addition, the expansion of suburbs further and further away from urban areas clears significant amounts of natural land and puts many animals and plants in danger. To avoid the continuation of these patterns, humans must cease clear-cutting forests and promote vertical development rather than outward development.","((ul))Deforestation heavily contributes to habitat loss and mass extinction((/ul)), and our forests continue to thin every year. In 2004, a Population Reference Bureau article stated that since the 1980s, “agricultural expansion, logging, development, and other human activities caused the deforestation of more than 120,000 square kilometers each year” (Meyerson). By contrast, only about 12,000 square miles per year was being reforested. Because of human actions, as well as natural climate shifts, forests today comprise less than half the area they did at their peak (Meyerson).","((ul))Overpopulation affects deforestation on a truly global scale, even in relatively uninhabited regions((/ul)). From deforestation-overpopulation studies to date, ((ul))a clear correlation exists between extremely low population density and maintenance of forests((/ul)). Generalizing from these studies, at population densities less than two people per square kilometer, populations generally tend to be able to sustain themselves without agriculture and timber products (Meyerson). However, in many low-density regions, such as in many Amazonian areas, forests are being destroyed despite a lack of people. This would counter the claim that overpopulation leads to deforestation and habitat loss, except for the fact that most of this land clearing results from external factors such as demand for timber or livestock from high population regions of the globe (Meyerson). In order to satisfy the needs and desires of the ever-growing number of humans across the globe, forests continue to be destroyed in areas that do not depend on cleared land for survival.","((ul))The developed world also feels the effects of land clearing and habitat destruction((/ul)). For instance, in Florida, from 1950-2000, the population rose at a rate of four percent annually. To accommodate the rapidly increasing population, almost of a quarter of the state’s land (all forest and wetland habitats) was cleared for human use. According to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, “in 1990, about 19 acres per hour of forest, wetland, and agricultural land [were] being converted for urban uses” (Effects of Overpopulation). And because of this massive growth, Florida’s ecosystems, on the whole, are more threatened than the ecosystems in all other U.S. states.","((ul))Suburban sprawl also contributes heavily to habitat loss and mass extinction((/ul)). According to the National Wildlife Federation, “((ul))The conversion of natural areas for homes, offices, and shopping centers has become one of the most serious threats to America’s native plant and animal species((/ul))” (Ewing and Kostyack). As the population grows, more land is needed to provide housing and jobs, and development stretches farther and farther away from urban areas. ((ul))And with increased sprawl likely comes increased habitat loss and degradation. In fact, in the first quantitative study of the sources of animal endangerment in California, scientists discovered that sprawl threatens California’s animals more than any other factor((/ul)) (Ewing and Kostyack). Low-density outward development destroys acres among acres of natural land and destroys the homes of thousands of plant and animal species, putting many in danger of population decline or even extinction.","((ul))Habitat loss, ((/ul))((ul))in particular deforestation((/ul))((ul)), also fragments and alters animal migration patterns((/ul)). Not only are ((ul))animal species unable to survive in the remnants of forested land left behind, but the “fragmentation of forests due to road, agriculture and human settlement development also impacts on wildlife by reducing the corridors used to move or migrate((/ul))” (Forest Animals Threatened). For example, years of illegal clear cut logging in the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve in Mexico has impacted the migration corridors for the endangered monarch butterfly. Millions of monarch butterflies migrate to the reserve annually for the winter months, but a thinning forest has the potential to change that as only an intact, continuous forest canopy can protect the monarchs “from both freezing cold during winter storms and from excessive warmth during the days” (“Deforestation in Monarch Butterfly Reserve”).","Deforestation also makes animals easier targets for poachers, as hiding and camouflage become more difficult. For these reasons, many species’ numbers subside and some eventually cease to exit (Forest Animals Threatened). In fact, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) approximates that human-led deforestation in the past 100 years has reduced the number of species living in forests by more than 30 percent (Forest Animals Threatened).","In many countries around the world, ((ul))overpopulation fuels habitat loss and places many plant and animal species in peril((/ul)). As the author of the Audubon publication, Population and Habitat: Making the Connection, suggests, “((ul))The destruction of the natural world we see across the globe today is “fallout” from the human population explosion that has occurred over the course of the last 50 years((/ul))” (Effects of Overpopulation). Population pressures require forests to be cut down for agriculture, cleared for development, or harvested unsustainably for human consumption. In addition, rapid growth in the demand for suburban housing has pushed human development farther and farther away from cities, destroying more habitats and endangering more species. To avoid a continuation of the “sixth mass extinction,” humans must stop clear-cutting forests and attempt to promote vertical development rather than sprawl((ul)).

Employing an unbalanced panel of South Asian countries and controlling for various economic and socio-demographic factors, we find that ((ul))((hl))remittances are significantly associated with a lower number of children born to women of childbearing age((/hl))((/ul)). This suggests the remittances’ substitution effect to be at play rather than the income effect, and may result from decreased need for children for financing the household’s future needs as well as from better access to healthcare and contraceptive methods available to migrant households((ul)). Remittances’ association with fertility appears to be more important than the transfer of fertility norms from migrants’ host countries. The monetary aspects of international migration may therefore be more important for the region’s demographic transition than social remittances.((/ul))","I. Introduction","The role that international migration and remittances resulting from the process play in the global economy has attracted increasing attention of researchers and policymakers. Although development impacts of international remittances have been extensively examined in a developing country context, such as those on poverty and inequality (Acosta et al. 2008; Adams 1992, 1998; Adams and Page 2005; Lucas 2005; Mughal and Anwar 2012), educational and health outcomes (Edwards and Ureta 2003; Fajnzylber and Humberto Lopez 2008; McKenzie and Rapoport 2011) and workforce participation (Amuedo-Dorantes and Pozo 2006; Funkhouser 1992; Görlich, Mahmoud, and Trebesch 2007; Makhlouf and Mughal 2013), demographic consequences of remittance flows have so far received scant attention.","((ul))((hl))During the last half century, the developing world has passed through a spectacular period of demographic transition moving from a high mortality, high birth regime towards a stable low infant and child death rates, low birth regime((/hl))((/ul)). Migration is one of the key coping strategies in the societies faced with high population growth. Migrants relieve economic pressure on the community by seeking employment opportunities elsewhere. ((ul))Money sent home by these migrants not only sustains the ((/ul))((ul))staybehind((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))households, but((/ul))((ul)) can also modify the households’ reproductive ((/ul))((ul))behaviour((/ul)). This can take the shape of either the income or substitution effect. The additional household income that results from migrant remittances alleviates the economic constraints impeding the fulfilment of the stay-behind household’s pent up reproductive desires (the socalled ‘Malthusianism of poverty’), thereby allowing a bigger family size (Abernethy 1996; Stark 1981). Assuming children to be normal goods, higher income would allow an increase in consumption (Becker 1960; Becker and Gregg Lewis 1973). This effect can be termed as the remittances’ income effect on left-behind household’s fertility.\t","On the other hand, ((ul))improved household economic prospects as a result of migrant remittances((/ul)) allow parents to develop their financial nest egg and reduce the need for children for ensuring parents’ financial requirements after retirement. This is particularly the case in societies where public social security systems are less developed and the traditional role of children as insurers of parents’ old age security from economic hardship is mostly intact. Lower financial constraints ((ul))allow parents to focus on children’s human capital development, which leads to a further decrease in fertility in the subsequent generations((/ul)).","Moreover, ((ul))((hl))better finances provide the migrant households access to previously unavailable medical care and contraceptive protection, and help the households attain the desired fertility level by reducing the risk of unwanted pregnancies((/hl))((/ul))((hl)). ((/hl))((ul))((hl))Lower fertility through these channels could be termed the remittances’ substitution effect on fertility((/hl))((/ul)) (Beine, Docquier, and Schiff 2008 called it the old-age security effect). The overall impact of remittances on household fertility therefore depends on whether the income or the substitution effect dominates, i.e. whether remittances increase the ‘quantity’ or the ‘quality’ of children.","In addition to these monetary impacts of international migration on the migrants’ home-country fertility, migration directly influences the homecountry fertility through social remittances in the form of transfer of reproductive norms and practices prevalent in migrants’ host countries (Beine, Docquier, and Schiff 2008; Fargues 2006).","A handful of empirical studies have examined the role of international remittances in the demographic evolution of developing countries. Fargues (2006) explored the fertility situation of three Mediterranean countries: Morocco, Turkey and Egypt, and found that remittances are associated with lower fertility in the first two and higher fertility in the third one. He suggested that differences in fertility rates of the main destination countries for the migrants from these countries might be the cause of this divergent fertility behaviour. Migrants from Turkey and Morocco mostly reside in Europe where demographic transition is complete, while Egyptian workers mainly live in the states of Persian Gulf where fertility rates have until recently remained high. In a cross sectional analysis of global fertility evolution and international migration, Beine, Docquier, and Schiff (2008) found evidence for a small positive effect of international remittances on home country fertility. However, their study indicates a much larger impact of the transfer of fertility norms. In another cross sectional study, Mughal and Anwar (2014) concluded that the receipt of foreign remittances is associated with lower fertility rates among migrant households in Pakistan, and remittances appear to have the strongest effect on household fertility among all the economic factors examined. Naufal and Vargas-Silva (2009) also found evidence of a negative impact of international remittances on the receiving country’s fertility rates. ((ul))Examining a panel of 59 developing countries, they inferred a negative relationship between remittances and fertility for the overall sample as well as for Latin America and Africa((/ul)). However, they did not find a similar robust relationship for Asian countries.","((ul))In this study, we examine fertility responses of international remittances in the context of South Asia((/ul)). The countries that constitute the South Asian region include Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. ((ul))South Asia’s significance lies in the fact that it is the world’s top remittance receiving region with $87.5 billion or 25.5% of the $343 billion global remittances received in 2014((/ul)). The region accounts for about a quarter of the world population, and is host to some of the highest population growth rates in the developing world. ((ul))Traditional fertility norms still survive in many ((/ul))((ul))parts of the region, while focus on children’s education is growing as is contraceptive prevalence, even though access is still patchy and subject to households’ financial resources. As a result, either of the two effects of migrant remittances is possible.((/ul))","South Asian countries have a diverse migration profile with sizeable migrant communities present in various OECD and non-OECD countries. However, more than half of the region’s migrant stock is located in the Middle East from where bulk of remittance flows to the region originates (United Nations 2013). If remittances to South Asian countries induce fertility changes in line with those in Egypt shown by Fargues (2006), remittances may end up slowing down the region’s demographic transition. In contrast, an opposite effect would suggest that migrant remittances are helping slow down the region’s population growth regardless of the migration destination.","II. Overview of fertility evolution in South Asia","South Asia is among the most densely populated parts of the world. Three of the region’s countries (India, Pakistan and Bangladesh) are among the world’s top 10 populous countries. India is the world’s second most populous country with a population of over 1.26 billion in 2014 (World Bank 2014), while Bangladesh has the highest population 3400 A. I. ANWAR AND M. Y. MUGHAL density of any medium or large-sized country at over 1,203 persons per square kilometre. South Asia’s fertility transition1 began late and the region has lagged behind most other developing parts of the world. Women of child bearing age in the region at an average gave birth to 6.5 children in the 1960s, and can still expect 2.9 children over their lifetime (World Bank 2014). ((ul))From the 1950s to the 2000s, the mean number of children per woman fell by around 40% in Nepal and Pakistan, by 47% in India, by over 50% in Bangladesh and Bhutan, by 60% in the Maldives and by 65% in Sri Lanka((/ul)) (Véron 2008).","As shown in Figure 1, fertility rates in the region ranged from a low of 2.2 in Sri Lanka to a high of 7.8 in Afghanistan during the 1970–2013 period. In Sri Lanka, the demographic transition started earlier than other parts of the region, and the process in the country is almost complete.2 At the other extreme, Afghanistan has only recently begun witnessing a fall in fertility rates.3 Barring these two outliers, fertility rates in the other six countries of the region are comparable, ranging from 2.4 in the Maldives to 3.6 in Pakistan during the 2005–2009 period4 (Figure 2).","((ul))A feature of the region’s demographic evolution is the sharp fertility declines witness in the 1980s and 1990s((/ul)). ((ul))Bangladesh and Maldives saw some of the sharpest drops in fertility witnessed anywhere in the world((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) The total fertility rate (TFR) in Bangladesh fell from 6.3 in 1971–1975 to 3.3 in 1994–1996 (BDHS 1997).5 Remarkably, much of the drop in fertility in South Asia occurred at development levels much lower than elsewhere around the world (Ram 2012; Siddhisena and DeGraff 2009), and resulted from complex social, demographic and institutional changes in the society. For instance, Fertility in Sri Lanka and Southern Indian state of Kerala reached rates seen in OECD countries at per capita income about a tenth of the OECD levels.","Over all, TFRs in the four southern and eastern countries of South Asia are lower compared with countries located in the north and west of the region. At subnational level, fertility rates have fallen at a greater pace in more developed areas, with rural– urban TFR differing by one or two in several countries (Eini-Zinab 2013; Frost 2011; Ram 2012). ((ul))Fall in birth rates in the region has gone hand in hand with decrease in infant and child mortality rates((/ul)) (Table 1). Pakistan’s infant mortality rate (IMR), for instance, more than halved from over 180 in 1960–70 in 2013, while Maldives’ dropped even more spectacularly from 215 in the 1960s to 8 in 2013.","This sizeable drop in fertility rates witnessed in some of the countries of South Asia was partly the result of sustained government-run family planning programmes and exposure to radio, television and the print media (Caldwell 1982; Cleland 1994). Other major reasons behind the fall in the region’s fertility levels include marriage at later age (particularly that of women), increasing use of various forms of contraception and abortion. Early and universal marriage has historically been the norm in the region, and pre-marital motherhood is rare. Marriage postponement can account for 20–30% of decline in fertility in Pakistan and Sri Lanka (Abeykoon, 2006; Cleland 2001), where female age at marriage reached 23 in 2007. However, in other parts of the region, ages at marriage for women have risen more slowly. For instance, female Singulate Mean Age at Marriage (SMAM) for Bangladesh and India was still 19 and 20 in 2011 and 2006, respectively, with 44.5% of Indian women aged 20–24 years getting married before 18 years (Raj et al. 2009).6 ((ul))In these countries, progress in contraceptive availability and abortions account for most of the decline in fertility levels. Use of contraceptive methods among women of child bearing age has risen from 13% to 53% in Bangladesh and from 35% to 55% in India. Although Contraceptive Prevalence Rate (CPR) has grown in Afghanistan too in recent years, the country still ((/ul))((ul))lags behind((/ul))((ul)) other countries in the region with a CPR of under 20% reported in 2010 (AMS 2010).((/ul))","Across the region, contraceptive use is much higher among literate and educated households. For instance, Pakistani women with at least secondary education are twice as likely to use a contraceptive method as women with no education (PDHS 2008). Tubal ligation, oral contraceptives and condoms remain the most popular contraceptive methods in South Asia. Increase in access to contraceptive methods in the region during the last 50 years has been in great part due to government family planning programmes which have frequently accompanied reproductive health awareness campaigns.","Increased abortion is another cause of fall in fertility across the region. Although the practice is reportedly widespread, its extent is not fully understood because abortion is generally illegal and unrecorded (Véron 2008). In Pakistan, for instance, one in seven pregnancies is reportedly terminated through induced abortion (Sathar and Zaidi 2009). In India, abortion rates have climbed sharply since the widespread availability of sex determination technology, with the child sex ratio in 2001 reaching 126 and 122 in the Indian states of Punjab and Haryana, respectively (Ram 2012). Son preference is widespread in South Asia (Leone, Matthews, and Zuanna 2003; Zubair et al. 2007).","III. Overview of remittance flows to South Asia","During the past four decades, South Asia has been an important region of emigration. Substantial South Asian migrant communities have developed in the Persian Gulf states, Europe, North America and East Asia. Although South Asian migrants residing in all of these four regions send substantial sums of money back home, remittances from the six Persian Gulf states (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates) constitute the largest share of flows to the region. ((ul))South Asia receives the highest amount of international remittances of any world region, with three of the region’s countries((/ul)) (India, Bangladesh and Pakistan) ((ul))among the top ten recipients in the world((/ul)) (World Bank 2014). Aggregate remittance inflows to the South Asian countries for the period 1975–2013 are shown in","Figure 3.","((ul))((hl))Remittance flows to the region exceed foreign direct investments, portfolio investments and official development assistance received by the ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))region, and((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) constitute the most important source of foreign exchange after exports receipts((/hl))((/ul)) (World Bank 2014). Relative to the size of the economy, the magnitude of remittance flows varies across the region with minor amounts received by countries like Bhutan and Maldives and substantial ones going to Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka (Table 2). In fact, ((ul))Nepal receives one of the highest remittance flows relative to the GDP, with remittance flows in 2013 surpassing 28% of the country’s annual output.((/ul)) At the regional level, distribution of remittances has greatly evolved during the past 30 years. In the 1980s, Pakistan received as much as one half of the total receipts, whereas in the 2000s, roughly the same share went to India. Figure 4 shows the countrywise distribution of aggregate remittances to South Asia for the 1975–2013 period. In addition to these officially registered remittances, significant amounts have traditionally been remitted to the region through informal means such as Hundi/Hawala and hand carry."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":129}},{"tag":"Remittances in South Asia decrease fertility – leads to higher human capital accumulation through more emphasis on education","cite":"Anwar and Mughal, 16 –  Anwar is an Associate Professor of Economics at Cape Breton University; Mughal is an Associate Professor of Economics and Finance at Pau Business School (Amar and Mazhar, 2016, \"Migrant remittances and fertility,\" Applied Economics, 48:36, 3399-3415, DOA: 6-28-2018 ) //SS ","text":["V. Findings","Tables 5 and 6 show various specifications of fixedeffect models. ((ul))Remittances to South Asia are found to have a statistically significant negative association with the fertility rate((/ul)). Marginal effects computed from the baseline estimation (Table 5, column 1) indicate ((ul))that a 1% increase in remittances relative to GDP is associated with a 1.7% decrease in fertility rate of the migrant sending country((/ul)). ((ul))The association between remittances and fertility seems stronger and more significant than several other ((/ul))((ul))factors, and((/ul))((ul)) reflects the prevalence of the substitution effect rather than the income effect((/ul)). The latter effect which kept fertility rates high in the region’s traditional societies seems to have weakened. ((ul))The substitution effect leads the households towards lower fertility by raising the opportunity cost of producing and raising children and shifts the quantity–quality equation in ((/ul))((ul))favour((/ul))((ul)) of quality((/ul)). Better financial wherewithal resulting from receipts from abroad also improve access to contraceptive methods among home country households which in turn leads to lower fertility.","((ul))We also carry out the above estimations by using crude birth rate as an alternative definition of fertility. The results for the baseline specification (column 2) corroborate our main findings((/ul)). ((ul))Migrant remittances retain their significant and negative association with ((/ul))((ul))fertility((/ul)) . A one percentage increase in remittance flows relative to home country GDP is associated with 0.15% fewer births per 1000 population.","In contrast to Beine, Docquier, and Schiff (2008), we find mixed evidence for a significant transfer of fertility norms from the main host countries of the South Asian migrants as the migration stockweighted host fertility variable often shows no significant association with South Asian fertility rates (even though the sign of the coefficient is usually positive as expected). This is in line with the inconclusive graphical evidence seen in Figure A1. This finding may owe to the fact that South Asian migrant communities, particularly those in the Persian Gulf, are substantial in size and maintain close networks. Moreover, many South Asian guest workers reside in the host countries on temporary, often non-renewable job contracts. Socialization and interaction with the host society is therefore limited. As a result, fertility patterns in the host societies filter through slowly to the home countries.","Weighting the host fertility measure with respect to the male and female migrant stock of the corresponding South Asian country shows that unlike male migration, female migration is negatively associated with home fertility (Table A2). Among other findings, infant mortality shows a significant positive association with the TFR. Decreasing mortality rates in the region are therefore associated with falling fertility rates. This association is also valid for under 5 mortality (Table 6, column 1).","Likewise, the association between the share of child bearing women in the population is expectedly positive, though mostly insignificant. Alternatively, another age-related variable: the dependency ratio shows a significant positive association with TFR (Table 6, column 6). This throws light at the role of South Asia’s young demographic profile. Median ages in the eight South Asian countries are low (for instance, median age of Afghans is only 15 years (ElBadry and Swanson 2012), and women’s age at marriage are barely above 18 (19 in Bangladesh, 20 in India). Gradual maturing of South Asian population (and hence smaller proportion of under 18) should predictably be related with decline in the region’s fertility rates.","On the other hand, contraceptive prevalence seems to be playing its expected role: improved availability of birth control methods is negatively associated with fertility rates, even though the relationship is not universally significant.","Female labour participation’s association with fertility, however, is strongly significant, implying that increased access to work in South Asia during recent times has contributed to reduction of fertility rates in the region.","In contrast, ((ul))per ((/ul))((ul))((hl))capita national income shows a significant positive association with fertility, suggesting that at the early stage of economic development experienced in the region during the previous decades, more income does not seem to have helped reduce net population growth, as the resulting rising survival rates might have compensated for the decrease in birth rates in the region((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).((/hl)) ((ul))The relationship is similarly valid if lagged per capita is instead used to ((/ul))((ul))take into account((/ul))((ul)) a possible time lag in fertility response to improving average household income ((/ul))(Table 6, column 5).8","((ul))Education shows an intuitive association with fertility, as primary school enrolment rates have a significant and negative relationship with the TFR. Girls’ primary education is likewise related((/ul)) (Table 6, columns 1 and 2). The association also holds in the case of net primary enrolment rates (column 3). The relationship between education and fertility does not appear to go beyond the primary level as the association with secondary school enrolment (column 4) is statistically insignificant.","In addition to the above described parsimonious specifications, we consider several extensions to the baseline model by including other explanatory variables and alternative variable definitions:","Changes in government policy on population welfare and birth control may significantly influence the fertility rates through concerted media and social awareness campaigns. We construct two dummy variables that take the value of one for a particular year if policies for checking population growth and reduce fertility are in place during that year. Findings suggest a strong helpful role of government policies in lowering fertility rates in South Asia (Table 5, columns 3 and 4). As already discussed in Section II, sustained family planning policies, especially in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and India, played an important role in the remarkable drop in fertility levels witnessed in the region during the last three decades.","On the other hand, policies on healthcare represented by the public health spending to GDP ratio and per capita health expenditure seem to have little association with total fertility (columns 5 and 6). Similarly, the proportion of rural population in the country’s population is taken as an indicator of changing spatial distribution of the population (column 7), and the ratio of industrial and services sectors value added to that of agriculture taken as an indicator of changes in the economy’s structure (column 8) both appear to have no significant relationship with home countries’ fertility.","Table 7, columns 1–3, shows specifications with different remittance variables. Employing per capita remittance amount in place of remittance to GDP ratio (column 1) does not affect the significant negative relationship between remittances and fertility. Squares of the two remittance variables are included in addition to the two respective variables (columns 2 and 3). The squared variables exhibit opposite signs reflecting the non-linearity of the remittance– fertility relationship.","Columns 4 and 5 show estimations excluding outliers. India is South Asia’s largest and most populous country, accounting for around 70% of the region’s annual output. Afghanistan, Bhutan and the Maldives, on their part, are small economies with few available observations. The three countries together account for 58% of the missing observations in the dataset. Controlling for these outliers does not compromise the gist of our findings. An interesting finding from the estimation excluding India is that host country TFR’s association with home country TFR is stronger in the smaller countries. This is probably because several of these countries have proportionally large migrant communities and may therefore have a greater exposure to host country social and reproductive norms.","((ul))Remittance are likewise found to be significantly and negatively associated with fertility in the ((/ul))((ul))firstdifferenced((/ul))((ul)) model((/ul)) (columns 6 and 7). The relationship maintains its statistical significance even though several variables are no more significant. We also obtain Arellano and Bond, and System GMM dynamic panel estimations. ((ul))The remittance–fertility association obtained is again ((/ul))((ul))similar to((/ul))((ul)) the baseline finding((/ul)) (estimations not shown).","To sum ((ul))up, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))we find strong support for the substitution effect of migrant remittances on ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))homecountry((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) fertility. This finding is robust across specifications, variable definitions and econometric techniques((/hl))((/ul)). Nonetheless, the evidence needs to be considered with a major caveat: The analysis is based on a dataset with a large number of missing observations, and relatively little data are available on some indicators (particularly those pertaining to policy or educational attainment).","VI. Concluding remarks","((ul))Population growth rates in developing world have been high during the last half century. South Asia’s population, for instance, has grown from 573.2 million in 1960 to over 1.69 billion in 2014 ((/ul))(World Bank 2014). ((ul))This study examined the role of international remittances sent by South Asian overseas migrants in the region’s fertility evolution during the 1970–2014 period. We found that remittances have a ((/ul))((ul))significant association with decline in the region’s fertility rates.((/ul)) This association is similar to the one found by Fargue (2006) for remittance inflows to Morocco and Turkey and unlike the one found in the case of remittances to Egypt. We propose that ((ul))this helpful relationship may be due to rising opportunity cost of producing and raising children as household incomes increase thanks to migrant remittances which may be pushing the quantity–quality paradigm in ((/ul))((ul))favour((/ul))((ul)) of quality((/ul)). This highlights international migration’s helpful role in the demographic transition of the developing countries of South Asia, which exerts itself mainly through the monetary channel of remittances and not through transfer of social norms from the host countries as suggested in previous studies. These findings suggest that by ((ul))contributing to the decline in the region’s high fertility rates, migrant remittances to South Asia participate in the human capital accumulation through higher emphasis on education((/ul)). International remittances can therefore be considered a useful flow of resources which contribute to the receiving countries’ future economic development."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":82}},{"tag":"Fertility decline key to multiplying fast growth – especially in the context of developing nations","cite":"Karra et al, 17 – Assistant Professor of Global Development Policy at the Frederick S.

To make our model as transparent as possible, we include a full description of its structure and assumptions in Appendixes 1 and 2, and its parameterization in Tables A1 and A2.","We recognize that while our projections for the effects of fertility reduction are roughly double those that have previously been predicted, our estimated effects are generated by relatively large reductions in fertility (one birth) over a relatively short period of time (15 years). While such significant declines in fertility have been observed in settings where strong family planning programs have been implemented, one may ask whether it is realistic to assume that similar programs and policies can replicate such results in sub-Saharan Africa, where ideal family size and desired fertility are higher than in other parts of the world (Bongaarts 2011). Clearly, family planning programs have costs and the programs cited here were expensive (Simmons, Balk, and Faiz 1991). Nevertheless, even the most expensive family planning programs have been shown to be cost-effective when compared to other interventions, even without considering their effects on economic growth (Simmons, Balk, and Faiz 1991; Schultz 1992; Cleland et al. 2006; Hughes and McGuire 1996).","Like Ashraf, Weil, and Wilde (2013) and others, we acknowledge that the economic growth brought about by fertility decline would not be sufficient to help a developing country “vault into the ranks of the developed” (National Research Council 1986). ((ul))((hl))With that said, we argue that asking whether fertility decline alone could determine a country’s path to economic growth and development was never an appropriate question to begin with.

Even if fertility were to decline and income per capita were to roughly double as we predict, it would still not be enough to close the estimated 30-fold gap in income per capita between rich and poor countries. To close such a gap would require several doublings in income per capita (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development 2002).

General economic models of rebellion have been articulated by Grossman (1992), Azam (2001), Bates (2001), Gates (2002) and others. Most scholars, however, recognize that individual grievances alone are insufficient to generate an armed rebellion; some vehicle must help mobilize communities of people around a common set of grievances.","((ul))((hl))A substantial body of empirical research finds that ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))national wealth is one of the strongest predictors of civil war onset((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) (((/ul))Collier and Hoeffler, 1998; Fearon and Laitin, 2003; Hegre and Sambanis, 2006; Sambanis, 2002). Interpretations of this empirical correlation, however, range from low state capacity to higher levels of material grievances. Our interpretation of per capita gross domestic product (GDP) as a predictor of civil war onset is consistent with the notion of low state capacity, but we posit that the functional importance of low state capacity is how it constrains states’ ability to offer political and economic concessions in response to opposition demands (Gartner and Regan 1996; Moore, 1998; Regan and Norton, 2005).","((ul))Moreover, civil wars often break out along cultural lines, even though the evidence suggests that ‘‘ethnic’’ and ‘‘non-ethnic’’ wars have similar pedigrees (((/ul))((ul))Sambanis((/ul))((ul)), 2001). ((/ul))((ul))Gurr’s((/ul))((ul)) (1970, 2000) work points to cultural status and discrimination based on ethnic or religious identification as important civil war determinants.((/ul)) Discrimination based on cultural characteristics can also increase a group’s ability to mobilize against the government by disproportionately encouraging grievances among a homogeneous population (Gurr, 2000). Many multiethnic countries survive the tumultuous seas of domestic politics, but when combined, ethnic dominance and economic deprivation can lead to groups coalescing around their common identity and common cause (Collier, 2000).","((ul))Mobilization can be facilitated by recourse to cultural ties (Ross, 2007), firmly held grievances (Weinstein, 2007), cross-border affinities (((/ul))((ul))Salehyan((/ul))((ul)), 2009), and community or kin relationships (Petersen, 2001)((/ul)). Moreover, biologists see kinship or group identity as forming a key element in the survivability and fitness of groups in relation to other groups (Wilson, 2002). Game theoretic models of cooperation also suggest that within-group behaviors facilitate survivability (Axelrod, 1997). Put differently, kinship patterns are associated with group fitness, remittances can be viewed in terms of kinship support, and mobilization can be driven by strong kinship ties.","((ul))If economic grievances can be linked to rebellious activity or civil ((/ul))((ul))war((/ul))((ul)) then mechanisms for smoothing economic difficulties should influence both the ability and willingness of aggrieved citizens to take up arms((/ul)). That is, communities rely on welfare provisions from the state, and to the extent that these provisions are constrained, insufficient or poorly targeted, local populations have increasing incentives to mobilize against the state. ((ul))((hl))Migrant remittances help dampen the shocks from economic instability((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)), which can in turn ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))reduce the pressure on the government from political opposition((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)).((/hl))((/ul))","Migrants and their remittances","((ul))In 2010, there were an estimated 215 million people—or about 3% of the world’s population—working in foreign countries((/ul)) (World Bank, 2011). ((ul))By World Bank estimates. formal remittances from foreign workers amounted to US$372 billion in ((/ul))((ul))2011, and((/ul))((ul)) may account for as much of 30% of the GDP of recipient countries((/ul)) (World Bank, 2011). ((ul))Roughly two-thirds of this amount went to developing countries. This level of remittances is over twice the amount of global official development assistance (ODA) in the same year and almost two-thirds of foreign direct investment. Research finds that the home countries gain more from remittances than they lose in lost tax revenue from emigration. Adelman and Taylor (1990) calculate that Mexico’s GDP jumps by US$2.69 to US$3.17 for every dollar received.((/ul))","((ul))By way of comparison, ODA is distributed by governments to governments and any transmittal to individuals must go through the recipient government. Foreign direct investment (FDI) is another form of financial transfer, but in this case money flows from private industry to private or government industry. Distributions to individuals or villages and towns are a function of the vagaries of economic production through jobs and other forms of infrastructural development tied to industrial enterprises((/ul)).","((ul))One of the key conceptual differences between these various financial transfers lies in how they are transmitted to the local level. In the case of migrant remittances, money is transmitted from individuals—often a relative—to individuals, forging a closer link between demand for and impact from remittances than more official transfers might provide((/ul)). ODA and FDI generally operate at the macro-economic level and often take years of budgeting and planning before they are implemented. The difference in mechanisms is so extreme that Miguel (2007) calls for a special program within the US foreign aid apparatus to (on an emergency basis) target the individual level as a means of forestalling political instability. ((ul))Put differently, he calls for aid to work much like migrant remittances do, where short-term increases can be manipulated and targeted locally((/ul)).","Formal and informal remittances","((ul))Migrant remittances are transferred via either formal or informal mechanisms((/ul)). This distinction is critical for our argument, and we stress that we focus exclusively on formal remittance mechanisms. ((ul))Formal remittances are transferred through existing financial institutions, which are regulated, and ultimately subject to state-level decisions((/ul)). Western Union is one of the largest examples of institutions that handle remittances. ((ul))An individual in one country deposits money, which is then transferred either through a bank or a Western Union office in the recipient’s country, where someone else picks up the funds((/ul)). Not only is the transmission transparent, but the office in the recipient country is subject to the policies of that country. US efforts to shut down transfers to Islamic organizations linked to terrorism can be seen as an example of how formal remittances can be controlled by placing constraints on the financial institutions (Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering, 2003; Elu and Price, 2012((ul))). Informal remittances, on the other hand, circumvent these institutional chokepoints by sending cash by hand, by ((/ul))((ul))courier or by local agents in the host and home countries. This is not always clandestine or nefarious in intention, simply another mechanism for kin to transfer money to their relatives.((/ul))","((ul))The World Bank estimates informal remittances might reach the level of 50% of those transmitted through formal mechanisms((/ul)) (Ratha, 2003), while the IMF estimate is 35–75% (Freund and Spatafora, 2008). Conventional wisdom and some scholarship posit that remittances provide a potential source for rebel recruitment and arming, and as such constitute one of the facilitating mechanisms behind rebellion (Collier, 2000; Elu and Price, 2012; Gunaratna, 2003). ((ul))Examples of informal remittances into civil war environments include the support of the Irish Republican Army from expatriates in the USA, the support of Eritrean rebels by the Eritrean diaspora, and support in Canada for in Sri Lanka’s LTTE.((/ul))","((ul))To date, the civil war literature has ((/ul))((ul))more often than not((/ul))((ul)) seen diasporas as a source of rebel start-up financing. We argue that those who postulate a rebel-funding role from diasporas are focusing on informal remittances, reflecting the smaller of the two remittance types((/ul)) (Collier, 2000; Collier and Hoeffler, 2004a). Since the informal approach is not subject to the same level of state interdiction or regulation, this informal stream may indeed be a source for the funding of rebels. However, because informal remittances are outside any mechanism to record amounts or recipients, we have no way to verify or comparatively examine such claims. Regardless of how informal remittances play out, our argument and empirical tests center on formal remittances and how they influence civil war onset.","Remittances and economic cycles","((ul))Evidence suggests that remittances are remarkably stable. Of five types of foreign exchange inflows—FDI, non-FDI private capital inflows, exports, official aid and remittances—the International Monetary Fund (2005: 73) finds that remittances are on average the least volatile. Remittance flows are also counter-cyclical((/ul)) (Frankel, 2009; Singer, 2010; Singh et al., 2011). ((ul))‘‘In those countries and in time periods where growth is relatively weak’’, the International Monetary Fund (2005: 73–76) argues, remittances increase both because ‘‘emigration increases and because workers already abroad increase their financial help to families back home’’. Thus, two factors are potentially at work in ((/ul))((ul))driving up remittances during hard economic times((/ul))((ul)). First, recessions or other forms of economic stress can encourage those that can move abroad to do so. Second, those already abroad frequently increase the amount they send back to their families to help mitigate the worst of their families’ economic hardships((/ul)) (Agarwal and Horowitz, 2002; Page and Plaza, 2006). ((ul))Economic stresses can go beyond price volatility and can present increasingly difficult times for state institutions that transcend the ability of normal financial flows to moderate.((/ul))","((ul))For example, survey research finds that Philippine migrants’ remittances replace roughly 60% of economic loss owing to economic shocks, suggesting that, ((/ul))((ul))in spite of((/ul))((ul)) their overall stability((/ul))((ul)), ((/ul))((ul))((hl))remittances are an effective mechanism for smoothing economic downturns((/hl))((/ul)) (Frankel, 2009; Yang and Choi, 2007). ((ul))Yang and Choi’s panel design uses a household survey with a rainfall-induced shock as an instrument for income decline. During periods of such income decline the demands on social welfare resources by individuals and groups would be at their highest, while at the same time the ability of the state to provide those resources would be most constrained. Absent a financial accounts buffer, the state would confront difficult choices. The easiest among this constrained set of choices may be to cut social welfare provisions, a policy often advocated by international lending institutions((/ul)) (Stiglitz, 2002). ((ul))The cumulative effect of these counter-cyclical ((/ul))((ul))((hl))remittances((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) should be to ((/ul))((ul))((hl))reduce the risk of political instability and civil war((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) that is generated by social welfare contraction. Remittances are often intended to compensate for ((/ul))((ul))poor economic conditions in the home country, and therefore should have a negative relationship with income growth((/ul)) (Acosta et al., 2008; Chami et al., 2005; Singh et al., 2011).","((ul))Remittances often have a compounding effect at the micro-level on growth and development by increasing the recipients’ funds to spend on consumption, education and other human capital accumulation((/ul)) (Acosta, 2006; Adams and Cueceucha, 2010; Calero et al., 2008; Rapoport and Docquier, 2005; Ratha, 2003; Yang, 2006). ((ul))The long-term micro-level effect has macro-level consequences through the development of a state’s human and physical capital((/ul)) (International Monetary Fund, 2005: 72). ((ul))Researchers are thus converging on evidence that remittance flows are large enough to play a role in encouraging macro-economic growth and development((/ul)) (Carling, 2005; International Monetary Fund, 2005; Keely and Tran, 1989; World Bank, 2006), ((ul))and we posit that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))this economic impact has political ramifications in terms of government stability((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)).((/hl))((/ul))","((ul))((hl))Remittances can also have a long-term impact in reducing poverty((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). Adams and Page (2003: 21–22) argue that individual remittances have a demonstrable macro-level ability to help decrease poverty, and they find that, in their data on 74 developing countries, ‘‘a 10 percent increase in the share of remittances in country GDP will lead to a 1.6 percent decline in the share of people living on less than $1.00 per person per day’’. Adams and Page suggest that remittances increase personal income and as a result decrease the number of structurally poor or severely impoverished members of a society((/ul)) (see also Fagan and Bump, 2006; Page and Plaza, 2006).","Remittances and civil war onset","((ul))We approach the moderating effect of remittances on civil war from the premise that most, but not all, civil wars result from grievances that can find their roots in economic hardship. That is, people are motivated to demand change when they endure forms of structural poverty, often triggered by income shocks; they are mobilized during these periods by entrepreneurs who can exploit this motivation. We recognize that political or social cleavages are important aspects of the grievance and mobilization process, but that economic distributions are often a function of political access and therefore social cleavages((/ul)). We also recognize that these are not independent conditions within any one society. ((ul))Moreover, civil wars generally require a sustained period of grievances born of hardship before a sufficient level of mobilization can occur that would pose a challenge to the state((/ul)). Some type of trigger is often necessary to solidify opposition resistance (Harff and Gurr, 1998), and sharp economic downturns can provide one type of trigger (Miguel et al., 2004).","((ul))While contemporary scholarship has not provided a sufficient empirical foundation for understanding the temporal sequence by which grievances and triggers interact to facilitate mobilization around an armed strategy for political change, we posit that longer-term structural conditions create the motivation to organize in opposition to government policy and that shorter-term economic and political constraints provide the immediate opportunity to rebel((/ul)). That is, mobilizing for an armed insurgency is risky and holds out a low probability of achieving its desired goals. ((ul))Under these conditions opposition entrepreneurs can exploit the economic conditions to mobilize rebels in support of their cause, and there is greater willingness on the part of ((/ul))((ul))each individual((/ul))((ul)) to do so. Such economic crises also make it easier for rebel leadership to purchase rebel labor (Azam, 2001; Collier, 2000; Gates, 2002; Grossman, 1991). If the effects of economic stress fall disproportionately on a ((/ul))((ul))particular identity((/ul))((ul)) group—for example a minority already at risk (((/ul))((ul))Gurr((/ul))((ul)), 2000)—then the mythologies and common narratives can ((/ul))((ul))create a source for economic hardship that appears rooted in deliberate state policy((/ul)) (Ross, 2003). We also see economic crises and political demands to redress economic constraints acting in concert.","((ul))At the core, our argument is that ((/ul))((ul))economic crises which generate political demands lie at the foundation for the motivation to rebel((/ul)). That is, neither poverty alone nor weak state capacity will be sufficient to push disadvantaged groups into the ranks of rebel organizations. Difficult economic conditions exacerbated by persistent economic strains can turn the tide between enduring hardship and supporting rebel movements. ((ul))Persistent economic struggles can be thought of in terms of a grind that threatens the status quo level of subsistence, at worst, or one that pushes otherwise comfortable conditions closer to the margins.((/ul))","((ul))In industrialized countries inflation is generally moderated by structured increases in wages, what we commonly refer to as cost-of-living increases. However, in countries without the labor structure or government capacity to offset increasing inflationary pressure with rises in income, inflation poses a harsh economic poison at the individual and societal level. Moreover, inflation for one year can be more easily addressed by government or industrial policy, but as inflation persists at high levels over extended periods, people can get pushed towards the margins and remedial policies become less adaptable. Economic decline also poses hardships on those closest to the margins, where declining domestic production leads to reductions in labor demands, and ultimately economic hardship at the individual level.((/ul))","Economic recession in any one year—as with inflation—can be mitigated by policy and expectations, but chronic economic contraction poses more serious problems, both for the individual and for the state. ((ul))Economic and political instability are linked processes. We know from prior research that political institutional instability is a strong predictor of civil war, where anocracy and transitions through an ((/ul))((ul))anocratic((/ul))((ul)) condition impose greater risks on the state((/ul)) (Hegre et al., 2001; Regan and Bell, 2010). ((ul))That is, political instability precipitates mobilization of an armed opposition group seeking to challenge the state for authority. The specific components that lead to instability within the institutions of government are less clear. We argue that economic instability and political institutional instability are linked, such that during harsh economic times the political institutions that already face an increased risk of civil violence confront pressures from two sides: the political elite dissatisfied with access to the political process, and the public dissatisfied with its economic plight.((/ul))","In the face of political and/or economic difficulties, mobilization by the opposition is necessary for the onset of civil war. A government has policy mechanisms that can reduce the motivation to rebel, particularly policies that influence economic conditions or the distribution of national resources. ((ul))If a civil war is less preferred than stability, then the smoothing of poor economic conditions by the increased influx of migrant remittances is in the interest of the individual recipients, as well as the government. Put differently, ((/ul))((ul))in spite of((/ul))((ul)) economic and political conditions that push toward civil war, ((/ul))((ul))external remittances can work to counteract these internal pressures ((/ul))((ul))by providing welfare payments that the government can no longer— or chooses not to—provide. Moreover, the state has an interest in facilitating the transfer of remittances, at least through formal institutions, which they can regulate.((/ul))","((ul))Continuing to provide for basic social welfare by smoothing economic contractions may be one of the keys to political stability in the most at-risk countries. While we do not propose a theory of migrant remittances, we postulate that expatriate ((/ul))((ul))family members remit out of both obligation and concern((/ul)) (Agarwal and Horowitz, 2002; Amuedo-Dorantes and Pozo, 2006; Yang and Choi, 2007). ((ul))During ((/ul))((ul))economic hardship family members living abroad would prefer a local sacrifice in return for increased security for their families ‘‘back home’’ over other options((/ul)). Panel studies tend to confirm this trend (Chami et al., 2005; Clarke and Wallsten, 2003; Rapoport and Docquier, 2005). ((ul))Therefore, states have an incentive to permit, if not encourage, remittances from migrant workers during difficult economic times. Furthermore, since rebellion is both risky and costly, those families who are most burdened by economic downturns have an incentive to try to increase remittances from relatives during times when their status quo is jeopardized((/ul)).","((ul))State capacity has many aspects, including but not limited to counter-insurgency efforts (Hendrix, 2010; Sobek, 2010). If economic or political grievances are at the core of insurgency movements, then letting market forces smooth economic declines might be less costly than counter-insurgency programs. Given the choice between policies that contribute to stability by facilitating externally generated social welfare payments (remittances) or counterinsurgency initiatives to snuff out rebellious movements, ((/ul))((ul))a policy of encouraging migrant remittances would be more economically efficient as well as socially altruistic.((/ul))","There are two related components to our argument. ((ul))The first is that economic instability contributes to the motivation to rebel against the state. Absent a grievance, rebellion is too costly given expectations of potential payoffs. Second((/ul))((ul)), ((/ul))((ul))((hl))migrant remittances serve as an economic smoothing mechanism by which the impact of economic triggers is muted, therefore reducing the risk of civil war by moderating the incentives to participate in armed struggle((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).((/hl)) ((ul))More directly, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))increases in migrant remittance will decrease the probability of observing a civil war during periods of economic and political stress((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) ((ul))Two testable propositions derive from our argument: first, a more general expectation is that as a country’s migrant remittances increase, the likelihood of a civil war onset decreases. From this perspective we would expect annual changes in remittances to be a significant predictor of the likelihood of civil war onset. Second, and more specifically, as migrant remittances increase during periods of crisis, the likelihood of a civil war decreases. That is, migrant remittances have their greatest impact on civil war when they act in a counter-cyclical manner to economic performance. In the most entrenched economic downturns increases in remittances will reduce motivations to rebel.((/ul))"],"stats":{"highlightedWords":135}},{"tag":"Remittances undermine authoritarian party regimes and lower the risk of civil war – creates a spillover of civic and democratic values","cite":"Escriba-Folch et al. 15 Abel Escriba-Folch is an Associate Professor at the Department of Political and Social Sciences of Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Abel, Covadonga Meseguer, and Joseph Wright, “Remittances and Democratization,” International Studies Quarterly, 2015, 571-586) // SR","text":["The Political Consequences of Remittances","((ul))Remittance flows to developing countries amounted to $325 billion in 2010, according to the World Bank, and continue to grow.5 Foreign remittances have exceeded official aid flows and non-FDI private capital inflows to low- and middle-income countries since the late 1990s((/ul)) (Chami, Barajas, Cosimano, Fullenkamp, Gapen, and Montiel 2008:12). ((ul))We see the same patterns in autocratic regimes. Further, remittance inflows are on average less volatile than other non-tax resources—such as oil rents and foreign aid((/ul)).6 Figure 1 shows that average oil income in autocracies remained steady through the 1990s and increased in the past decade as oil prices rose. ((ul))While remittances also rose with oil prices in the ((/ul))((ul))2000s, foreign aid to autocracies has not evidenced the same spike. The rise of remittances in the past two decades means that some countries’ economies have become increasingly dependent on these flows.((/ul)) In countries as diverse as Albania, Lesotho, Haiti, and Jordan, remittances constitute more than 15 percent of GDP. Do these flows have political consequences for receiving countries?","Relying on previous sociological and anthropological work, political scientists now explore how patterns of transnational engagement influence political attitudes and behaviors in home countries as well as how emigrants exert “voice” after “exit” (Hirschman 1978; Goodman and Hiskey 2008; Iskander 2010; Careja and Emmenegger 2012; Meseguer and Burgess 2014). Abundant case studies show that emigrants engage in the politics of their home countries (Levitt 1998; Kapur 2010). Yet, we know little about the macropolitical consequences of this transnational engagement for sending countries, as most studies focus on one country—mainly Mexico—or use individual-level data.","((ul))One group of studies uses survey data that asks respondents about their migratory experience—including receiving remittances—and political behavior. Other research examines how remittances affect electoral outcomes, such as voting for incumbent parties. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Whereas the first set of work finds that emigration has a demobilizing effect, the second shows that remittances generally reduce electoral support for incumbent parties and thus may ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))further political change((/hl))((/ul)). ((ul))Extant research therefore associates remittances with both decreased political mobilization and increased political change at the same time((/ul)). In this section, we review the mechanisms for these two opposing effects and then, in the next section, discuss how these mechanisms influence the prospects of democratization in different autocratic contexts.","Using a variety of surveys based on Mexican respondents, Perez-Armendariz and Crow (2010), Goodman and Hiskey (2008), and Germano (2013) find that emigration experience reduces certain types of political behavior, such as voting, talking about politics, punishing incumbent parties in elections, and seeking political information. Two mechanisms may explain these findings. ((ul))First, Goodman and ((/ul))((ul))Hiskey((/ul))((ul)) (2008:170) posit that having relatives abroad and receiving remittances reorient individuals toward transnational political activities as they rely more on families and less on the state to satisfy their needs. Second, and more importantly, remittances may insulate recipient households from domestic economic conditions and thus ((/ul))((ul))reduce economic grievances((/ul)). ((ul))((hl))Remittances((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) usually accrue to households in countercyclical patterns, which help to ((/ul))((ul))((hl))smooth domestic economic shocks and consumption volatility((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). This might reduce dissatisfaction with the incumbent regime and preclude political change, perhaps ((/ul))((ul))((hl))by ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))lowering the risk of civil war((/hl))((/ul)) (Regan and Frank 2014:5–8).","((ul))In contrast, other studies contend that remittances foster political change, and even democratization, via three main mechanisms: an income effect, contentious mobilization, and social learning. First, remittances increase recipient households’ income, which in turn augment resources necessary for political participation,((/ul)) such as time and money. ((ul))One version of this argument posits that additional non-labor income in the form of remittances makes individuals less dependent on the state’s ((/ul))((ul))clientelistic((/ul))((ul)) spending, prompting individuals to reduce their electoral support for incumbent parties or to ((/ul))((ul))engage in other forms of participation such as protests((/ul)). For example, using municipal election data in Mexico, Pfutze (2012, 2014) tests the social learning and the income mechanism but only finds support for the latter: ((ul))Remittances reduce turnout for the ruling ((/ul))((ul))Partido((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))Revolucionario((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))Institucional((/ul))((ul)) (PRI) in municipalities where the PRI was entrenched((/ul)). Similarly, Diaz-Cayeros, Magaloni, and Weingast (2003) show that a higher percentage of a municipal population living in the United States—a proxy for remittances—is associated with municipality defection from the PRI and voting for the opposition.","((ul))Second, remittances may support ((/ul))((ul))particular candidates((/ul))((ul)) and parties in receiving countries or finance protest activities back home((/ul)).7 ((ul))Remittances thus influence domestic politics in sending countries when they directly fund opposition political groups((/ul)). Migrant diasporas, for example, are a key source of financing for some domestic rebel groups, which increases the feasibility of an armed uprising and, as a result, raises the likelihood of civil conflict (Collier and Hoeffler 2004: 565, 568). Using survey data from sub-Saharan Africa, Dionne, Inman, and Montinola (2014) show that individuals who report receiving remittances are more likely to participate in protests but less likely to vote than those who report receiving no remittances. In more institutionalized polities, remittances finance legal opposition parties and thus increase their capacity to challenge the incumbents in elections.8 Others find that emigrant remittances increase the resources available for collective challenges to the state, increasing the risk of civil war (Miller and Ritter 2014).","((ul))Third, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))remittances((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) may ((/ul))((ul))((hl))involve the transfer((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) of “social remittances,” which consist of the ((/ul))((ul))flow of ((/ul))((ul))((hl))new ideas, values, and behaviors from migrants to their sending countries((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))(Levitt 1998). ((ul))The transfer of social remittances occurs through long-distance cross-border interactions, face-to-face cross-border interactions, and migration information networks ((/ul))(Levitt 1998; Perez-Armendariz and Crow 2010; Perez-Armendariz 2014). ((ul))Thus, contact with emigrant relatives may increase participation and dissent through a process of social learning via the ((/ul))((ul))spillover of civic and democratic values((/ul)), ((ul))which alter the distribution of political preferences and behaviors in sending communities((/ul)) (Pfutze 2012, 2014; Perez-Armendariz 2014). ((ul))For example, Perez-Armendariz and Crow (2010) find that knowing migrants—whether friends or relatives— increases political participation as well as dissatisfaction with incumbents in Mexico.((/ul))","Most current research focuses on how remittances influence politics in new democracies and specifically Mexico (Goodman and Hiskey 2008; Perez-Armendariz and Crow 2010; Tyburski 2012; Germano 2013; Perez-Armendariz 2014; Pfutze 2014).9 However, research on the political influence of remittances need not be restricted to democratic settings (Diaz-Cayeros et al. 2003; Pfutze 2012). The only paper that examines remittances and macropolitical change using a broad sample of autocracies is Ahmed (2012), which examines two types of foreign income together: aid and remittances.10 This study posits that autocracies use aid to finance patronage (an income effect) and that as remittances increase private consumption, governments divert expenditures from the provision of welfare to private spending (a substitution effect). Both mechanisms result in extra resources for regimes to fund patronage. However, as noted above, inflows of aid—if fungible—accrue directly to the state while individual remittances accrue largely to households. Hence, these two income flows may have distinct (even opposite) effects on democratization. Moreover, by focusing on how autocracies differ from democracies, this research ignores the question of how regimes in different autocratic contexts benefit from or are harmed by remittance flows. The next section discusses the proposed mechanisms linking remittances to the prospects of democratic change in different autocratic regimes and advances a theory to explain why remittances further democracy in party-based dictatorships.","Remittances and Autocratic Regime Survival","Are some regimes more vulnerable to workers’ remittances? ((ul))Autocratic regimes differ along many dimensions, such as the size of their support coalition (Bueno de Mesquita, Smith, ((/ul))((ul))Siverson((/ul))((ul)), and Morrow 2003), the group from which elite supporters are selected (Geddes 1999), and the extent to which they ((/ul))((ul))co-opt potential opponents with policy concessions (Gandhi 2008). These characteristics influence a regime’s durability and its vulnerability to domestic and foreign shocks((/ul)). ((ul))We argue that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))foreign remittances reduce citizens’ dependence on government transfers and public goods and thus destabilize autocracies((/hl))((/ul)). ((ul))By giving individuals and households an exit option from the regime’s patronage network, remittances sever the ((/ul))((ul))clientelistic((/ul))((ul)) link between voters and incumbent dictators causing defections from their support coalition. Further, by increasing the resources of opposition parties and groups, remittances may increase the capacity of these parties to challenge the regime in autocratic elections((/ul)).","((ul))These mechanisms, we argue, are more likely to occur in dictatorships that hold multiparty elections regularly and rely primarily on broad-based distribution of goods to purchase the loyalty of large coalitions and deter investment in the opposition. Concretely, remittances should ((/ul))((ul))((hl))reduce voters’ dependency on state-delivered goods((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) and thus ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))undermine dominant-party-regimes’ capacity to mobilize political support((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)).((/hl))((/ul))","((ul))Dominant-party-regimes are dictatorships in which “a party organization exercises some power over the leader at least part of the time, controls the career paths of officials, organizes the distribution of benefits to supporters, and mobilizes citizens to vote and show support for party leaders in other ways” ((/ul))(Geddes 1999:124). The latter two features help us understand how remittances weaken these regimes. ((ul))Dominant-party dictatorships tend to have broader and deeper support coalitions than other regimes. Their survival therefore depends not only on institutionalized power-sharing agreements and the provision of private goods to top party officials and other elites (patronage), but also on the delivery of (often local) public goods to large segments of the population (clientelism) aimed at mobilizing mass support((/ul)) (Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2003:87; Magaloni and Kricheli 2010; Malesky, Abrami, and Zheng 2011). ((ul))Thus, parties not only serve to channel elites’ demands and credibly share power with significant groups, but also work as large ((/ul))((ul))clientelistic((/ul))((ul)) machines through which benefits are distributed in an effort to mobilize supporters((/ul)) (Magaloni 2006:15, 65–66; Greene 2007:40, 2010; Pepinsky 2007:143; Levitsky and Way 2010:66–67).11 ((ul))The party’s ability to politicize public resources, transforming them into patronage goods, enhances its capacity to organize the distribution of benefits to supporters (Greene 2010:808). This usually results in party-regimes having large public sectors((/ul)) (Desai, Olofsgard, and Yousef 2009:111; Greene 2010).","((ul))The party monopoly over state resources makes it possible for the regime to control access to public housing, social services, property, fertilizers, subsidies, scholarships, jobs, and even food. And, most importantly, it allows the incumbent to make this access conditional on support for the regime party. This ensures that important segments of society depend on the regime economically((/ul)) (Magaloni and Kricheli 2010((ul))). Benefits to citizens also take the form of private goods((/ul)). For example, the People’s Action Party’s (PAP) public housing programs in Singapore are a key source of support and votes for the regime since 1960. During elections in Malaysia, workers from the ruling party, the United Malays National Organization (UMNO), visit rural households to dispense cash payments to supporters and deter opponent mobilization (Pepinsky 2007:144). But most commonly, the benefits delivered from dominant parties take the form of targeted public goods and services. In Malaysia, federal politicians distributed grants for rural development to local clients to reward support for UMNO (Pepinsky 2007:146). Blaydes (2011:74) shows that during Mubarak’s rule in Egypt, areas that voted for the opposition saw little improvement in sewerage and water coverage between the mid-1980s and 1990s. The PRI in Mexico systematically directed PRONASOL funds, mainly consisting of public works targeting municipalities, to ensure voters’ loyalty in contested municipalities and withdrawn from those supporting the opposition (Magaloni 2006:68, Chapter 4).","((ul))Individuals receive targeted benefits and public goods and services in exchange for supporting the regime. This support may entail tacit acquiescence or party membership, but also often involves endorsing the ruling party in elections((/ul)). Elections are not uncommon in dictatorships; indeed, a majority of dictatorships held multiparty elections in the past decade (Gandhi and Lust-Okar 2009; Hyde and Marinov 2012). Almost all dominant-partyregimes hold regular national elections, and these regimes hold elections more frequently than other types of autocracies (Geddes 2003). Autocrats use elections to deal with different kinds of threats and intend to win them (Gandhi and Lust-Okar 2009). Consequently, among other strategies such as voter intimidation and restrictions on opposition parties, party-regimes exploit their resource advantage to fund clientelistic practices— where ruling parties exchange votes for material benefits and services—and to enjoy a privileged economic and media position during electoral campaigns (Dixit and Londegran 1996; Magaloni 2006; Greene 2010).","((ul))The previous section identified three mechanisms through which remittances may foster political change: severing ((/ul))((ul))clientelistic((/ul))((ul)) links between citizens and the ruling party; increasing funding for opposition parties and groups; and social remittances, or the spillover of civic and democratic values. Our hypothesis suggests that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))remittances should undermine autocratic survival in dominant-party-regimes((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) principally through the income effect of remittances and possibly through an increase in resources available to opposition parties. We argue ((/ul))((ul))that ((/ul))((ul))remittances weaken party-regimes ((/ul))((ul))((hl))by reducing citizens’ dependence on ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))clientelistic((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) transfers((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) and thus increase their economic autonomy, namely their “ability to earn a living independent of the state”((/ul)) (McMann 2006:28). ((ul))By increasing private income, remittances reduce the marginal utility of state-provided targeted benefits as well as local public goods and services((/ul)).","((ul))This argument builds on the stylized fact that ((/ul))((ul))remittances increase household consumption((/ul))((ul)) to acquire goods and thus represent a substitute for goods provided by the regime. Existing research shows that recipient households use remittance income to finance private consumption but also as investments in education, health, agriculture, and business((/ul)) (World Bank 2006a,b; Fajnzylber and Lopez 2007:23–33; Chami et al. 2008((ul))). Additionally, remittances enable citizens to obtain local public goods that substitute for government welfare and infrastructure expenditures((/ul)). For example, Adida and Girod (2011:17) find that Mexican households use remittances to purchase access to public services, such as sanitation and clean water, undermining the state monopoly on the provision of these goods. ((ul))In Yemen, during the 1970s, local cooperatives used remittances to invest in road construction, schools, clinics, and farming projects (Chaudhry 1989:133–134). In Senegal, migrant associations (((/ul))((ul))dahiras((/ul))((ul))) use remittances to fund projects and social services in their communities of origin “without having to rely on state intervention((/ul))” (Diedhiou 2011:6). ((ul))These examples suggest that remittances provide households and individuals with an “exit” from the regime’s ((/ul))((ul))clientelistic((/ul))((ul)) network((/ul)) (Diaz-Cayeros et al. 2003; Ahmed 2011; Pfutze 2012).","((ul))Two requisite conditions underpin the logic of the income effect: (1) Remittance recipients care about ideological preferences, and (2) the regime cannot substantially expand its budget by extracting revenue from remittances, which they then use to buy political support from remittance households. The first condition is a standard assumption in models of clientelism, where voter utility is a positive function of income and a negative function of support for the regime/incumbent party as captured by the distance between their own ideological position and that of the party they support((/ul)). Hence, clientelistic transfers decrease (to zero at the limit) as an individual’s support for the regime increases or as the voter’s ideology moves closer to the incumbent party’s position. Transfers, in these models, are the price the regime pays to alter the individuals’ political behavior.12 As Magaloni and Kricheli (2010:128) argue, ((ul))“[c]((/ul))((ul))itizens((/ul))((ul)) with alternative sources of income can better afford to make ‘ideological investments’ in democratization and oppose the regime.” Likewise, McMann (2006:28) posits that “economic autonomy” explains citizens’ willingness to challenge local authorities instead of self-censoring their preferences.((/ul)) ((ul))Further, ((/ul))((ul))clientelistic((/ul))((ul)) networks easily trap poorer voters, as lower incomes reduce the price the regime must pay in exchange for support. Substantial evidence suggests that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))remittances benefit the poor and help reduce poverty((/hl))((/ul)).13 ((ul))By increasing income and thus the monetary value of transfers needed to buy support, remittances weaken state clientelism, lowering the marginal utility of such transfers and increasing the importance of ideological preferences in voting and other political decisions.((/ul))","((ul))The second condition is that the regime does not substantially augment its resources by capturing remittances, which are then used to offset the increase in the price of continued support. Numerous studies agree that remittances are largely nontaxable((/ul)) (Chaudhry 1989; Abdih et al. 2012; Ahmed 2012; Pfutze 2012, 2014). The World Bank (2006a:93), for example, notes that “[m]ost remittance-receiving countries today do not impose taxes on incoming remittances.” In practice, governments rarely tax remittances directly because they are highly elastic to the tax rate as remitters can easily evade formal controls (Eckstein 2010). Thus, directly taxing remit tances is likely to result in fewer remittances sent through formal channels (Freund and Spatafora 2008((ul))). For this reason, we follow the extant research in suggesting that remittances are generally not taxable and do not substantially increase nondemocratic governments’ revenues.((/ul))14","((ul))Empirical tests of this argument in Mexico show that remittances decrease votes cast for the incumbent and benefit the opposition by weakening of ((/ul))((ul))clientelistic((/ul))((ul)) ties((/ul)) (Pfutze 2012, 2014). Dahou and Foucher (2009:17) concur, noting that “[t]he shift of the Senegalese economy from groundnuts to migration and its increasing dependence on resources generated abroad could be seen as the final stage in the process of ending the hegemony once enjoyed by the state over Senegalese society.” Senegal transitioned to democracy in 2000 when the incumbent Socialist Party lost the presidential election. However, we lack systematic tests of this argument for a large number of autocracies.","((ul))Thus, we expect ((/ul))((ul))((hl))remittances to increase the likelihood of democratic transition((/hl))((/ul)). We should find the strongest support for this expectation in dominant-party dictatorships as opposed to other autocracies because the former typically (i) have organized opportunities for collective action and the expression of dissent, particularly via elections and (ii) have broader and deeper support coalitions comprising poor households in which we expect the income effect of remittances to operate most strongly. ((ul))To explore the proposed mechanism linking remittances to democratization, we further examine whether remittances alter electoral behavior in autocracies in a way that punishes the incumbent((/ul)).","((ul))First, weakening clientelism permits individuals to revise their evaluation of the government and express their true preferences about the regime. When the utility of registering((/ul)) ((ul))disapproval of the regime—given remittances—is larger than that of supporting it, expressing dissent cannot be too costly. On one hand, dominant-party-regimes are both less repressive (Davenport 2007) and more likely to have regular, institutionalized mechanisms for leadership turnover that typically occur through elections (((/ul))Geddes 2003). If the ruling party loses an election, this generally leads to a democratic transition. In other regimes, in contrast, destabilizing dissent more often entails contentious collective action (Ulfelder 2005).","Second, dominant-party-regimes have broader winning coalitions than other autocracies and politicize public resources to mobilize support. To retain power, the regime party typically wins elections. ((ul))Broader support coalitions in these dictatorships are more likely to contain poorer households that rely on remittances. In many countries, the share of households that receive remittances is substantia((/ul))l.15 Further, the positive income effect of remittances may not be limited to direct recipients, as foreign income can have multiplier effects leading to improvements in the living conditions of non-migrant households as well (World Bank 2006a: 70, 95). ((ul))((hl))These ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))spillover effects((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) increase “environmental economic autonomy”((/hl))((/ul)) (McMann 2006:31–34). ((ul))Through the income mechanism, remittances undermine ((/ul))((ul))clientelistic((/ul))((ul)) ties and make some individuals and localities more likely to manifest disapproval or withdraw their support for the regime party((/ul)). Elections reflect the loss of political support from the coalition, as a decline in turnout for the incumbent party may lead to electoral victory for opposition parties, as occurred in Mexico and Senegal in 2000.","Other dictatorships—particularly personalist regimes— also rely on the distribution of benefits to supporters, but they are more likely to have a relatively small coalition comprised mainly of individuals with family and ethnic ties to the leader (Geddes 2003:72–74). In contrast, party-regimes more often co-opt large groups of potential opponents into the support coalition or rely on large preexisting organizations such as labor unions or independence movements (Bratton and van de Walle 1994; Geddes 1999; Smith 2005). In personalist dictatorships, which typically have smaller support coalitions than party dictatorships, this group is less likely to contain poorer individuals whose main income comes from remittances. ((ul))The political support of relatively ((/ul))((ul))lowincome((/ul))((ul)) supporters is therefore less likely to be necessary to retain power in non-party-based regimes. Further, benefits accruing to each member of a personalist coalition are private goods and thus substantially larger((/ul)) (Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2003:129–132). ((ul))It is therefore less likely that utility from remittances exceeds the benefits obtained by supporting the regime. Thus, even though patronage politics is central to the logic of personalist rule, we do not expect remittances to undermine the patronage links between regime supporters and the dictator in personalist regimes((/ul)).16 In military regimes, patronage may be present too but it is not the main instrument such regimes use to retain power. Rather, repression and institutional power-sharing between branches or factions within the military are the most significant instruments (Davenport 2007; Geddes, Frantz, and Wright 2014a).","((ul))There may be other mechanisms through which remittances enhance the prospects of democratization, particularly in dominant-party-regimes. However, these mechanisms are likely to strengthen our argument. For example, migrant diasporas directly influence political events in sending countries by disseminating information, framing political issues, financing candidates and parties, as well as by lobbying foreign governments and international organizations.((/ul)) As O’Mahony (2013:805) notes, ((ul))“[p]((/ul))((ul))olitical((/ul))((ul)) contributions may be given directly to parties by migrants or passed on to politicians by migrants’ families.” Thus, remittances work in conjunction with migrant diasporas that help finance and mobilize domestic opposition groups.((/ul))","The influence of augmented political resources for opposition mobilization should differ across autocratic contexts as well. Regular elections in dominant-partyregimes often pit legal opposition parties against the incumbent. The ruling party wins these elections because it enjoys resource advantages thanks to its monopoly access to public resources and state-controlled institutions such as the media (Magaloni 2006: Chapter 1; Greene 2007:5–6). Excluded from such resources, opposition parties benefit from foreign contributions, increasing their ability to compete for office, thus facilitating democratic transition. Hence, in dominant-party-regimes, remittances undermine the resource advantage ruling parties enjoy by providing opposition groups with funds they are unable to generate domestically.","For example, in Ethiopia, opposition parties that boycotted the 1995 and 2000 elections won 172 seats in the 2005 parliamentary election, while the ruling EPRDF retained “only” 327 seats—more than 150 fewer seats than it had won in the 2000 election. As Lyons (2007:540) emphasizes, “[t]he two main opposition coalitions that participated in the May 2005 elections had clear roots in the diasporas of North America and Europe.” In fact, most of the campaign funding for one of the main opposition coalition groups, the Coalition for Unity and Democracy, came from diaspora communities (Arriola 2008:120).","((ul))In contrast, in regimes that are less likely to have regular and competitive mechanisms for leadership succession, remittances may simply increase the capacity of outside groups to forcibly oust the regime. In autocratic contexts where opposition groups and parties are banned, diaspora funds thus finance insurgencies((/ul)) (Collier and Hoeffler 2004).17 ((ul))While remittances in these cases may increase the prospects of a forced, or even violent, regime change, these regime ousters usually lead to a subsequent autocracy and not to democracy((/ul)) (Geddes, Wright, and Frantz 2014b).","((ul))Finally, emigration also fosters social learning by transmitting ideas and information about social norms, including democratic values, to those left behind((/ul)) (Levitt 1998; Perez-Armendariz 2014). ((ul))However, the social learning mechanism would operate provided emigrants settle in advanced, well-governed democracies, which is far from the rule in many developing countries((/ul)) (World Bank 2011:12). ((ul))Further, emigration—rather than economic remittances—should be a better measure of transferring values because migration is more likely to reflect political preferences as citizens leave when they dislike the state of political affairs at home((/ul)) (Hiskey, Montalvo, and Orces 2014). Thus, their departure may decrease turnout for the incumbent (Pfutze 2014). Addressing the multiple mechanisms through which emigration may influence democratization requires timeseries data on emigration, but existing data are low quality, with poor coverage for most autocratic countries.18 Yet, we acknowledge that emigration can be a potentially confounding variable and show that the influence of remittances is robust to controlling for net migration, which is the best available measure given our research design."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":128}},{"tag":"Remittances vital to improving economic prospects and human capital development in Africa","cite":"African Leadership 18 – (“Remittances: An Overlooked But Important Economic Driver in Africa”, African Leadership, http://africanleadership.co.uk/remittances-overlooked-important-economic-driver-africa/ // AA)","text":["[chart omitted]","The forces of globalization and migration have become particularly potent on the global economic scene in the last two decades and they don’t appear to be slowing down.

This result is not particularly surprising given the contradictory evidence from various empirical studies. On the one hand, the study by Lopez, et al. (2007), who analysed a panel of 20 countries from 1990 to 2003, seemed to confirm that real exchange rates appreciated due to remittance inflows and, as a result, widened the current account deficit; thus suggesting that remittances may have been a cause of Dutch disease. Similar results were found by Amuedo-Dorantes and Pozo (2004) for 13 Latin American and Caribbean countries, Lartey et al. (2012) in their a sample of 109 countries between 1992 and 2003, as well as Gazi, Hassan and Holmes (2013), who report a long run relationship between remittance inflows and Dutch disease. Conversely, the findings of others studies are consistent with this study: i.e. that the impact of remittances on exchange rates is generally weak and not statisically significant. Barajas et al. (2010) reported that ((ul))countries tend to offset exchange rate appreciation and Dutch disease due to remittances by having relatively flexible labor markets((/ul)) (to reduce resource movement effects), ((ul))more open economies and higher volumes of trade((/ul)).

These broadly include the amount of remittances (as a percentage of GDP), the flexibility of labor markets, the depth of financial markets, patterns of consumption and investment, and the extent of an economy’s openness and level of trade. Other factors are also at play. Exchange rate appreciation from capital inflows may also depend on the business cycle and the level of excess capacity within a developing economy. The greater the excess capacity the more an economy can absorb remittances without adding inflationary pressures and seeing the currency appreciate. This would apply especially when remittances substitute for deficits on the balance of trade on the current account.

The cultural historians and theorists I am discussing write in the shadow of Foucault. Indeed Homo Sacer offers itself as a supplement to Foucault, arguing the need to complete his inquiry into the grand renfermement of hospitals and prisons that, for Agamben, should have culminated in those exemplary places of modern biopolitics, the concentration camp and the totalitarian state.45 Even Edward Said’s Orientalism, that founding text of postcolonial studies, is also very consciously a supplement to Foucault’s analysis of the operation of power from the late eighteenth to the mid-twentieth century.

((ul))((hl))Tempting as it is to exploit the ease with which ‘the leper’ so readily becomes the ideal type of concepts such as Kristeva’s abjection and Agamben’s bare life, the reality for lepers in the modern period was often more complex((/hl))((/ul)). As we shall see, mid-nineteenthcentury ((ul))((hl))metropolitan medicine resisted the idea that lepers should be isolated and lose their human ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))rights((/hl))((/ul)), and was supported in this by British governments of the time. Agamben argues that within the biopolitical horizon that characterizes modernity, ((ul))((hl))the physician and the scientist supervise the camps of bare life((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), ((/ul))47 ((ul))((hl))but the integration of medicine with politics he is indicating was also resisted by liberal medicine for much of the nineteenth century((/hl))((/ul)). And ((ul))in the eyes of the missionary sent out to run a leper colony((/ul)), ((ul))Agamben’s space of exception was the ante-room to a place of especial privilege with God((/ul)). In other words, for much of the nineteenth century ((hl))‘((/hl))((ul))((hl))the leper’ was less an emblem of bare life than a contested prototype of an emergent biopolitics((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) My aim is to historicise the processes that Foucauldian cultural history and theory conceptualise, and to suggest ((ul))they were not always as totalitarian and clear-cut as Gilroy and Agamben, for ((/ul))((ul))example((/ul))((ul)), assume.((/ul)) ((ul))Reading back from the Nazi concentration camps((/ul)) ((ul))into the nineteenth century can imply a more lethal biopolitics than is always strictly justified.((/ul)) This is not to deny many of the lines of continuity that Gilroy and Agamben trace, but to suggest a more conflicted genealogy and a more nuanced history. This argument will be picked up in later chapters. These matters have a particular bearing on the kind of medico-cultural history I am attempting. Foucault’s explorations of marginality have had a special appeal for interdisciplinary scholars, particularly for those practising history at its boundaries whose infringements have often been resisted by academic historians.48 There has been closely related border tension around the fringes of the history of medicine. This has been well discussed by Roger Cooter, who describes how on the one hand the historian of medicine has concentrated on the historical context of biomedical knowledge and practice, while, on the other, ((ul))((hl))the literary-somatic turn in cultural studies has resulted in the appropriation of the body((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) as a crucial element in the attempt at writing a conceptual history of modernity((/ul)).49 In a less polarised summary of this field he describes ‘an intellectually and methodologically motley traffic of social, literary and cultural historians and critics pursuing, and ...reproblematising, the politics of the body and its representations’.50 Despite his relative even-handedness, ((ul))Cooter((/ul)), a historian of medicine himself, ((ul))is critical of the ‘historical emptiness’((/ul)) he discerns ((ul))in much literary-cultural ‘body-work’((/ul)): ‘((ul))((hl))One ends up with((/hl))((/ul)) myriad ((ul))((hl))revelations((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) well described and often arresting((/ul)), ((ul))((hl))but no explanation((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) either ((/ul))((ul))((hl))of the genesis or((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) the ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))context in which particular discourses are sustained((/hl))((/ul)). Aesthetics prevail.’ And as he puts it more acerbically, ((ul))((hl))by exceptionalising and homogenising biomedicine((/hl))((/ul))((hl)), ((/hl))((ul))((hl))these ‘literary champions of the ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))discursive’ produce ‘fictitious((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) (if critically convenient) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))harmonious translations ... between alleged social and scientific domains’((/hl))((/ul)).51 ","These strictures are not unfair.

One such is Michael Worboys’ Spreading Germs (2000), which demonstrates that the concept of ‘germs’ lacked any fixity of meaning in the period leading up to the development of bacteriology, and that even after this there was no ‘single bacterial model for germs or their actions in any branch of the profession’.52 Worboys’ scrupulous investigation of germ ideas and practices in the second half of the nineteenth century should be an important check on metaphorically inclined cultural critics who see infection, contagion and invasion wherever they look. Only in the 1890s, Worboys argues, was the ‘military analogy of invading germs in conflict with the body’s defences’ becoming widely used.53 Yet a history such as Worboys’ is confined to the medical profession and its local cultures, and there is every reason for historians and others of a more broadly cultural inclination to examine the ubiquity of disease and infection language in this period and beyond. The task should be to try and bring these different worlds into more considered relation with each other.

((ul))The Leviticus((/ul)) writer((ul)) is concerned with blemishes of the skin((/ul)), and there is no equivalent of the account in Numbers, which describes it as a condition in which the flesh is ‘half consumed’ (12: 12). Mary Douglas argues that Leviticus’s description suggests not one but various skin diseases, including skin cancer, psoriasis, tropical ulcers, yaws, and major infectious diseases such as smallpox or measles.14 ((ul))In medieval and early modern Europe ((/ul))((ul))((hl))leprosy was very often a generic term((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))for a wide range of skin diseases((/hl))((/ul)) and, clinically speaking, it is only in the early nineteenth century that a sustained attempt was begun to distinguish leprosy from other skin disorders, and to distinguish between different types of leprosy itself. That said, the ((ul))Leviticus writer is obsessively concerned with establishing ‘true leprosy’ and with distinguishing it((/ul)) fromothersuperficiallysimilardiseases.Andforallthatleprosycontinued to be run together with other skin diseases, it was also imperative to differentiate a disease that was believed to be highly contagious and whose consequences for the sufferer were so serious.

Does a constant set of causes underlie the apparent continuity of response to leprosy since biblical times? For a medical scientist such as Olaf K. Skinsnes, leprosy is a disease with a unique medical pathology that produces a unique social response; a constant set of causes results in an identical stigma wherever the disease appears.15 And a literary critic like Nathaniel Brady also sees the resurfacing of fears about leprosy in Europe in the nineteenth century, after centuries during which the disease had virtually disappeared, as testimony to its constant power as an emblem of sin and moral decay.16 For Zachary Gussow, however, to regard the reaction to leprosy as a psychological and cultural constant is to augment the very process being described and to endorse the idea of the long unchanging history of leprosy’s taint; ‘[h]umanity’s dread is termed a natural response’, and leprosy becomes perpetually identified with stigma. Biblical tradition and the literary imagination, he suggests, have been particularly important in sustaining this account of the history of the disease.17 Gussow himself denies the universality of both the response and its causes, arguing that leprosy was ‘retainted’ in the modern colonial period; around the turn of the twentieth century it was transformed from ‘a feared clinical entity’ into ‘a stigmatised phenomenon’.18 He sees a number of interlocking reasons for this: the discovery of the leprosy bacillus in 1874 which offered scientific support for those who argued the disease was contagious rather than hereditary; the belief that leprosy was racially selective, and had become a tropical rather than a European disease; the movement of indentured labour around the world following the abolition of slavery, and consequent fear of the disease spreading; and the organised involvement of Western missionaries in leprosy work in the wake of the expansion of European empires.19 This approach is clearly more satisfactory than trans-historical and trans-cultural explanations that see the fear of leprosy as constant and unchanging. ((ul))The idea of ‘retainting’ also fits the sequence proposed by Foucault in which leprosy disappeared from the Western world at the end of the Middle Ages, with criminals and the insane taking the part previously played by the leper((/ul)).20 Gussow builds on some of the possibilities opened up by Foucault’s argument.21 There are, however, significant differences between the two. ((ul))Gussow treats modern leprosy almost as if it were a new diseas((/ul))e, although he declines to be drawn into the question of the continuity or otherwise of biblical and medieval leprosy with its modern forms.22 In terms of its stigmatisation ((ul))he insistently emphasises discontinuity((/ul)): ‘It is unnecessary to search the human psyche deeply or to reach far back into history to account for modern lepraphobia.

Bauman’s analysis is persuasive inside those areas of contemporary society where hunger for movement is, oxymoronically, a required luxury. His analysis is, however, just a little too deeply impressed by a tendency which can also be seen, mutatis mutandis, in the work of Pierre Bourdieu, a tendency slightly to over-generalize the condition of what Bourdieu called the ‘fun ethic’ of the ‘rising petit-bourgeoisie’ (Bourdieu 1984: 365–71). Memorably, Bauman has written of ‘tourists and vagabonds’, ‘globals and locals’, inhabitants of a new st and a new second world: For the inhabitants of the rst world – the increasingly cosmopolitan, extraterritorial world of global businessmen, global culture managers or global academics, state borders are levelled down, as they are dismantled for the world’s commodities, capital and nances. For the inhabitant of the second world, the walls built of immigration controls, of residence laws, and of ‘clean streets’ and ‘zero tolerance’ policies, grow taller; the moats separating them from the sites of their desire and of dreamed-of redemption grow deeper, while all bridges, at the rst attempt to cross them, prove to be drawbridges. (Bauman 1998: 89) In Bauman’s view, in the hydraulic era of mass armies and huge workforces, the Panopticon could quite properly be seen as a ‘diagram of a mechanism of power reduced to its ideal form’ (Foucault 1979: 205), as the conceptual essence of interior regulation.

As he travelled from British Guiana to Barbados, Antigua, Trinidad, Dominica and Jamaica, Milroy was alarmed to discover that the 1867 Report was virtually unknown. It ‘had been seen by very few; most of the medical men even had not read it ...It seemed as if not above two or three copies had ever reached each colony; in more than one, the Government offices were without a copy.’7 Milroy’s task now became one of spreading the word according to the College of Physicians to a superstitious and incredulous colonial world. Throughout his tour he drummed home the message that leprosy was hereditary and not contagious, and therefore that strict isolation was unwarranted and the neglect of patients inhumane. He wanted lepers to be treated alongside other chronically ill patients, and for the ‘leprosy’ label to be dropped from the title of institutions:","((ul))((hl))As long as((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) the terms ‘leper’, ‘leprosy’, are continually being repeated, it will be very difficult to disabuse the public mind of the dread and aversion which the words have hitherto suggested.

Since the human-being names a relationship of care between the “self, ” Being, and its projection into the external world(freedom), claiming that the black is incapable of such care places him[them] outside the realm of freedom and into the domain of the unfree, the care-less, and the unthought.

The TB infection rate among foreign-born persons was 9.8 times as high as that among U.S.-born persons.2 The article documents the medical testing process for TB required of immigrants and refugees, and this points to foreigners who are unscreened, especially the illegal alien population as the logical source of this disproportionate rate of TB incidence. It should also be kept in mind that among U.S. citizens who contract TB their exposure to the disease may well have come from exposure to a non-U.S. citizen. “The pork tapeworm, which thrives in Latin America and Mexico, is showing up along the U.S. border, threatening to ravage victims with symptoms ranging from seizures to death. ... The same [Mexican] underclass has migrated north to find jobs on the border, bringing the parasite and the sickness—cysticercosis—its eggs can cause[.] Cysts that form around the larvae usually lodge in the brain and destroy tissue, causing hallucinations, speech and vision problems, severe headaches, strokes, epileptic seizures, and in rare cases death.”3 ((ul))((hl))The problem((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), however, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))is not confined to the border((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) region, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))as((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) illegal ((/ul))((ul))((hl))immigrants have rapidly spread across the country((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) into many new economic sectors such as food processing, construction, and hospitality services.

Illegal immigrants crossing into the United States could bring any of these threats, however.

The federal government's Department of Homeland Security has public health controls in place to minimize any possible health risks, including medical units at the busiest border stations and measures to protect Customs and Border Protection including gloves, long-sleeve shirts, and frequent hand washing. In addition, the CDC’s Division of Global Migration and Quarantine has measures in place to protect the population from communicable diseases. The agency works through a variety of activities to prevent the introduction, transmission, and spread of communicable diseases in the United States. It operates Quarantine Stations at ports of entry; establishes standards for medical examination of persons headed legally for the United States; and administers interstate and foreign quarantine regulations governing the international and interstate movement of humans, animals, and cargo. The agency also alerts state authorities of newly arrived immigrants with certain health conditions. The CDC's Epidemiology Team also monitors infectious diseases among immigrants and refugees with their disease surveillance systems, investigations of disease outbreaks, and their Migrant Serum Bank of anonymous immigrant and refugee blood samples available for research.

CSIS published their report on HIV/AIDS and immigration in March 2007,4 which outlined the flaws and highlighted the contradiction of the ban with the global efforts of the United States in the HIV/AIDS epidemic. CSIS called for a change in the law, either to change the language of the INA to allow for removal of the HIV ban or to broaden the availability of waivers.4 In July 2008, with the renewal of PEPFAR funding, Congress removed the phrase ‘‘which shall include infection with the etiologic agent for acquired immune deficiency syndrome,’’ from the INA.2 This allowed the DHHS to reclaim authority to independently determine the definition of a “communicable disease of public health significance.” The following year, ((ul))under((/ul)) the new ((ul))Obama((/ul)) administration, ((ul))((hl))DHHS proposed a rule removing HIV from the list of inadmissible infections and with it, removing HIV testing from the scope of required immigrations examinations((/hl))((/ul)).

((/ul))The results highlight the need for more research to understand which youth are most affected by bias victimization and how to reduce its occurrence. It is important for research to examine more closely whether risk for bias victimization is worse for certain groups of youth, in different contexts, and how that risk is changing over time. ((ul))For example, although we did not find African-American youth to be at heightened risk for bias-based victimization in our national survey, as noted above, there may be particular communities in which their risk is higher.((/ul)) Additionally, there may be trends in understudied subgroups of youth who may not have been a significant focus of previous research. ((ul))((hl))Immigrant youth and Islamic youth may be seeing heightened bias victimization in recent years, as political and cultural climates change((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) In general, ongoing research is needed measuring how risk for bias-based victimization for different vulnerable youth vary by local contexts (e.g., school and neighborhood climate and demographic make-up), and as a result of shifts in larger cultural and political contexts. Research is also needed to help understand how to prevent the perpetration of bias-based peer harassment and other bias victimization. For example, research is needed to understand which youth are more likely to perpetrate bias-based harassment. ((ul))((hl))Research has already identified links between early homophobic name calling behavior and later sexual harassment perpetration((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) (Espelage et al., 2017).((/ul)) Similarly, future research might examine whether early bias-based harassment is linked to later perpetration of more serious bias-based assaults and hate crimes. There also may be protective factors across ecological levels that, if better understood, could provide clues to developing preventive interventions to reduce victimization, or negative impact on victims (Hong & Espelage, 2012). ((ul))Parent-child relationships, peer relationships, and peer group dynamics, for example, all may mediate the experience and impact of bias-based victimization.((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))For schools and policy-makers, the findings suggest the importance of expanding the focus on youth victimization beyond just bullying (Finkelhor, Shattuck, Turner, & Hamby, 2016). ((ul))Bullying has received a lot of attention from researchers, school professionals and parents, but the current study suggests that bias-based harassment can also be distressing for youth.((/ul)) ((ul))An incident of harassment that includes bias language, may not necessarily meet the typical criteria for bullying (repeated aggression by a perpetrator who is more powerful than the victim) (Gladden et al., 2014; Olweus, 2007), and therefore could be dismissed by caregivers and school professionals. While the use of explicit racial slurs at school might attract adult intervention, many other bias-based harassment incidents may be dismissed as ‘common name-calling’((/ul)). Our data suggest that the use of bias language in a harassment incident should signal to caregivers and school professionals that careful follow-up is called for and intervention may be warranted. It is critical that schools work to prevent bias-based victimization through social-emotional learning programs and diversity and inclusiveness education. Researchers must help to identify educational programs and strategies that are most effective in reducing this kind of victimization. Additionally, schools can be proactive in identifying victims of bias-based harassment by asking questions about bias language during incident inquiries. ((ul))If present, this and other research suggests that the youth may need additional emotional support and assistance.((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))Positively, there are indications that bias victimization may be declining at least for some types of victimization. The School Crime Survey finds rates of youth exposure to hate language have dropped from 12% in 2001 to 7% in 2015 (Zhang et al., 2016). Similarly, the 2015 National School Climate Survey found that the percentage of students hearing homophobic remarks dropped from over 80% in 2001 to less than 60% in 2015, although LGBTQ students reported a higher incidence of negative remarks about gender expression in 2015 compared to 2013 (Kosciw et al., 2016). This is encouraging but also emphasizes the importance of research that tracks youth experiences with bias victimization by asking detailed questions about multiple kinds of victimization experiences as part of national surveys. ((ul))((hl))Bias-based harassment victimization is a common occurrence for youth, with over one-half of harassment incidents containing bias language((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). Study findings indicate that such incidents are linked with elevated distress and negative social and school consequences for targeted youth((/ul)). Data show that these harassment incidents may not meet formal definitions of bullying, but nonetheless have significant negative impact on youth, suggesting that prevention and intervention policies need to incorporate these into bullying education efforts.

Why should the world mourn the “premature” end of the “American Century”?

There is nothing surprising about that vote for anyone who honestly examines the history of “U.S. foreign affairs,” to use a common elite euphemism for American imperialism. Still, by far and away world history’s most extensive empire, the U.S. has at least 800 military bases spread across more than 80 foreign countries and “troops or other military personnel in about 160 foreign countries and territories.” The U.S. accounts for more than 40 percent of the planet’s military spending and has more than 5,500 strategic nuclear weapons, enough to blow the world up 5 to 50 times over. Last year it increased its “defense” (military empire) spending, which was already three times higher than China’s, and nine times higher than Russia’s. Think it’s all in place to ensure peace and democracy the world over, in accord with the standard boilerplate rhetoric of U.S. presidents, diplomats and senators? Do you know any other good jokes? A Pentagon study released last summer laments the emergence of a planet on which the U.S. no longer controls events. Titled “At Our Own Peril: DoD Risk Assessment in a Post-Primary World,” the study warns that competing powers “seek a new distribution of power and authority commensurate with their emergence as legitimate rivals to U.S. dominance” in an increasingly multipolar world. China, Russia and smaller players like Iran and North Korea have dared to “engage,” the Pentagon study reports, “in a deliberate program to demonstrate the limits of U.S. authority, reach influence and impact.” What chutzpah! This is a problem, the report argues, because the endangered U.S.-managed world order was “favorable” to the interests of U.S. and allied U.S. states and U.S.-based transnational corporations((ul)). Any serious efforts to redesign the international status quo so that it favors any other states or people is portrayed in the report as a threat to U.S. interests. ((/ul))To prevent any terrible drifts of the world system away from U.S. control, the report argues, ((ul))the U.S. and its imperial partners((/ul)) (chiefly its European NATO partners) ((ul))must maintain and expand “unimpeded access to the air, sea, space, cyberspace, and the electromagnetic spectrum in order to underwrite their security and prosperity.” ((/ul))The report recommends a significant expansion of U.S. military power. ((ul))The U.S. must maintain “military advantage” over all other states and actors to “preserve maximum freedom of action” and thereby “allow U.S. decision-makers the opportunity to dictate or hold significant sway over outcomes in international disputes,” with the “implied promise of unacceptable consequences” for those who defy U.S. wishes.((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))“America First” is an understatement here. The underlying premise is that Uncle Sam owns the world and reserves the right to bomb the hell out of anyone who doesn’t agree with that((/ul)) (to quote President George H.W. Bush after the first Gulf War in 1991: “What we say goes.” It’s nothing new. From the start, ((ul))((hl))the “American Century” had nothing to do with advancing democracy((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) As numerous key U.S. planning documents reveal over and over, the ((ul))((hl))goal of that policy was to maintain and((/hl))((/ul)), if necessary, ((ul))((hl))install governments that “favor[ed] private investment of domestic and foreign capital, production for export, and the right to bring profits out of the country((/hl))((/ul))((ul)),”((/ul)) according to Noam Chomsky. Given the United States’ remarkable possession of half the world’s capital after World War II, ((ul))Washington elites had no doubt that U.S. investors and corporations would profit the most. Internally, the basic selfish national and imperial objectives were openly and candidly discussed. ((/ul))As the “liberal” and “dovish” imperialist, top State Department planner, and key Cold War architect George F. Kennan explained in “Policy Planning Study 23,” a critical 1948 document: We have about 50% of the world’s wealth, but only 6.3% of its population. … In this situation, we cannot fail to be the object of envy and resentment. Our real task in the coming period is to devise a pattern of relationships which will permit us to maintain this position of disparity. … To do so, we will have to dispense with all sentimentality and day-dreaming; and our attention will have to be concentrated everywhere on our immediate national objectives. … We should cease to talk about vague and … unreal objectives such as human rights, the raising of the living standards, and democratization. The day is not far off when we are going to have to deal in straight power concepts. The less we are then hampered by idealistic slogans, the better. ((ul))The harsh necessity of abandoning “human rights” and other “sentimental” and “unreal objectives” was especially pressing in the global South((/ul)), what used to be known as the Third World. ((ul))Washington assigned the vast “undeveloped” periphery of the world capitalist system—Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia and the energy-rich and thus strategically hyper-significant Middle East((/ul))—a less than flattering role. ((ul))It was to “fulfill its major function as a source of raw materials and a market((/ul))” (actual State Department language) ((ul))for the great industrial (capitalist) nations((/ul)) (excluding socialist Russia and its satellites, and notwithstanding the recent epic racist-fascist rampages of industrial Germany and Japan). ((ul))It was to be exploited both for the benefit of U.S. corporations/investors and for the reconstruction of Europe and Japan as prosperous U.S. trading and investment partners organized on capitalist principles and hostile to the Soviet bloc.((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))“Democracy” was fine as a slogan and benevolent, idealistic-sounding mission statement when it came to marketing this imperialist U.S. policy at home and abroad. Since most people in the “third” or “developing” world had no interest in neocolonial subordination to the rich nations and subscribed to what U.S. intelligence officials considered the heretical “idea that government has direct responsibility for the welfare of its people” (what U.S. planners called “communism”), Washington’s real-life commitment to popular governance abroad was strictly qualified, to say the least. “((ul))Democracy” was suitable to the U.S. as long as its outcomes comported with the interests of U.S. investors/corporations and related U.S. geopolitical objectives. It had to be abandoned, undermined and/or crushed when it threatened those investors/corporations and the broader imperatives of business rule to any significant degree.((/ul)) As President Richard Nixon’s coldblooded national security adviser Henry Kissinger explained in June 1970, three years before the U.S. sponsored a bloody fascist coup that overthrew Chile’s democratically elected socialist president, Salvador Allende: “I don’t see why we need to stand by and watch a country go Communist because of the irresponsibility of its own people.” ((ul))The U.S.-sponsored coup government((/ul)) that murdered Allende ((ul))would kill tens of thousands of real and alleged leftists with Washington’s approval((/ul)). The Yankee superpower sent some of its leading neoliberal economists and policy advisers to help the blood-soaked Pinochet regime turn Chile into a “free market” model and to help Chile write capitalist oligarchy into its national constitution. “Since 1945, by deed and by example,” the great Australian author, commentator and filmmaker John Pilger wrote nearly nine years ago: “((ul))((hl))The U.S. has overthrown 50 governments, including democracies, crushed some 30 liberation movements and supported tyrannies from Egypt to Guatemala((/hl))((/ul)) (see William Blum’s histories). ((ul))Bombing is apple pie((/ul)).” Along the way, Washington has crassly interfered in elections in dozens of “sovereign” nations, something curious to note in light of current liberal U.S. outrage over real or alleged Russian interference in “our” supposedly democratic electoral process in 2016. Uncle Sam also has bombed civilians in 30 countries, attempted to assassinate foreign leaders and deployed chemical and biological weapons.

((ul))No militaries were enhanced to address power vacuums, no security dilemmas drove insecurity or arms races, and no regional balancing occurred once the stabilizing presence of the U.S. military was diminished.((/ul)) The rest of the world acted as if the threat of international war was not a pressing concern, despite the reduction in U.S. capabilities. Most of all, the United States and its allies were no less safe. The incidence and magnitude of global conflict declined while the United States cut its military spending under President Clinton, and kept declining as the Bush Administration ramped the spending back up((ul)). No complex statistical analysis should be necessary to reach the conclusion that the two are unrelated.((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))Military spending figures by themselves are insufficient to disprove a connection between overall U.S. actions and international stability. Once again, one could presumably argue that spending is not the only or even the best indication of hegemony, and that it is instead U.S. foreign political and security commitments that maintain stability. Since neither was significantly altered during this period, instability should not have been expected. Alternately, advocates of hegemonic stability could believe that relative rather than absolute spending is decisive in bringing peace. Although the United States cut back on its spending during the 1990s, its relative advantage never wavered. ((ul))However, even if it is true that either U.S. commitments or relative spending account for global pacific trends, then at the very least stability can evidently be maintained at drastically lower levels of both. In other words, even if one can be allowed to argue in the alternative for a moment and suppose that there is in fact a level of engagement below which the United States cannot drop without increasing international disorder, a rational grand strategist would still recommend cutting back on engagement and spending until that((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))level is determined.((/ul)) Grand strategic decisions are never final; continual adjustments can and must be made as time goes on. Basic logic suggests that the United States ought to spend the minimum amount of its blood and treasure while seeking the maximum return on its investment. And if the current era of stability is as stable as many believe it to be, no increase in conflict would ever occur irrespective of U.S. spending, which would save untold trillions for an increasingly debt-ridden nation. It is also perhaps worth noting that if opposite trends had unfolded, if other states had reacted to news of cuts in U.S. defense spending with more aggressive or insecure behavior, then internationalists would surely argue that their expectations had been fulfilled. If increases in conflict would have been interpreted as proof of the wisdom of internationalist strategies, then logical consistency demands that the lack thereof should at least pose a problem. ((ul))As it stands, the only evidence we have regarding the likely systemic reaction to a more restrained United States suggests that the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))current peaceful trends are unrelated to U.S. military((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))spending((ul)).

Furthermore, ((ul))co((/ul))((ul))((hl))nditions in immigrant detention facilities have been widely criticised as violating international law((/hl))((/ul))((hl)). ((/hl))((ul))((hl))Sexual minorities in detention often face social isolation, physical and sexual violence directed at them because of their gender identity, and harassment((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) by both facility staff and other detainees((/ul)). In most prison settings, ((ul))sexual minorities face ((/ul))((ul))((hl))a heightened risk of targeted physical and sexual violence((/hl))((/ul)). Transgender women1 are particularly vulnerable to this abuse because they are usually housed with men; ((ul))in the US, for instance, they are thirteen times more likely to be sexually assaulted than other detainees. LGBTI ((/ul))((ul))((hl))detainees are often placed in ‘administrative segregation’((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) in response to complaints of sexual or physical violence or as a preventive measure((/ul)). Although segregation may seem to be the only available means of protecting sexual minority migrants from violence, in many detention centres it is indistinguishable from solitary confinement, involving confinement for 23 out of 24 hours a day in a tiny cell with extremely limited access to the outdoors, exercise or other people. This practice can lead to severe mental health after-effects and may exacerbate Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) or other conditions developed in response to violence in the country of origin or during migration. (((ul))In some cases, LGBTI detainees may selfisolate so as to avoid stigmatisation by refugees from their countries of origin((/ul)).) ((ul))Such solitary confinement is ((/ul))((ul))((hl))held by international human rights bodies as amounting to torture((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), inhuman or degrading treatment when it deprives detainees of meaningful access to detention centre services or, although it is widely termed ‘non-punitive isolation’, is tantamount to conditions of penal solitary confinement.((/ul)) The medical needs of sexual minorities in detention, whether or not they require a regular regimen of HIV medication or hormone therapy, are rarely met. In many migrant detention facilities, only urgent medical care is provided; interpreters are rarely provided during medical procedures; there are insufficient private spaces for medical consultations; and medical expenses are borne by the detainees. LGBTI migrants in detention face significant risk of HIV infection and exposure to other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). ((ul))((hl))Some arrive in detention infected,((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) often due to a history of sex work or exposure to sexual violence. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Others are infected in detention, where rates of((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) HIV, AIDS and other ((/ul))((ul))((hl))STIs tend to be higher((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) than the rate in the general ((/ul))((ul))population. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Infection as a result of sexual violence in detention is of particular concern to transgender women, who are often housed with men((/hl))((/ul)). ((ul))((hl))Detention also increases exposure to other infectious diseases, which heightens risk of HIV-related morbidity((/hl))((/ul))((hl)). ((/hl))((ul))((hl))The lack of medical care available is also evidenced by the limited access of transgender detainees to hormone and other treatment associated with gender transition.((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) In the US, however, according to recent guidelines, transgender immigrant detainees may receive hormone treatment but only if they were undergoing such treatment prior to being detained. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Transgender migrant detainees also report invasive and voyeuristic medical examinations((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) by officials who are unfamiliar with their medical needs or have had little exposure to individuals with gender non-conforming identities. Sexual minority migrants, who experience high levels of physical and sexual violence in countries of origin, often suffer serious mental health after-effects. Detention conditions – including the loss of physical liberty (particularly when segregated), staff abuse, marginalisation by other detainees, lack of access to appropriate medical care, substandard hygiene, combined with the often indefinite nature of immigration detention – exacerbate mental illness.((/ul)) Voyeuristic or offensive questioning of LGBTI migrants by migration authorities also detrimentally affects their mental health. ((ul))Since ((/ul))((ul))((hl))access to mental health counselling((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) in migrant detention ((/ul))((ul))((hl))is extremely rare((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), sexual minorities not only suffer ongoing after-effects of harm experienced in countries of asylum but also are often retraumatised by experiences in detention. While LGBTI detainees – particularly those who are transgender – are often so visible in immigration detention systems that they are put at grave physical risk, they remain invisible where their protection concerns matter most: in the policies and guidelines that are designed to protect all detainees from harm and process migrants equitably and with dignity under international law.((/ul)) The core elements of protection in human rights law that relate to detainees include the prohibition on torture, the prohibition on arbitrary detention, limits on detention time, non-discrimination clauses, and the right to liberty. Both the UN Human Rights Committee and the UN General Assembly have confirmed that these tenets of human rights law must be applied without discrimination to all peoples, including migrants. Other refugee-specific legal standards promulgated by UNHCR prohibit penalising migrants for illegal entry or presence, and assert that detention of asylum seekers should only be contemplated as a last resort. In October 2012, UNHCR issued new guidelines governing the detention of refugees. Intended as guidance to governments, legal practitioners, decision-makers and others, they provide valuable leadership on the special concerns of LGBTI asylum seekers in detention. Guideline 9.7 states that: Measures may need to be taken to ensure that any placement in detention of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or intersex asylum-seekers avoids exposing them to risk of violence, ill-treatment or physical, mental or sexual abuse; that they have access to appropriate medical care and counselling, where applicable; and that detention personnel and all other officials in the public and private sector who are engaged in detention facilities are trained and qualified, regarding international human rights standards and principles of equality and non-discrimination, including in relation to sexual orientation or gender identity. Where their security cannot be assured in detention, release or referral to alternatives to detention would need to be considered. In this regard, solitary confinement is not an appropriate way to manage or ensure the protection of such individuals.2 Although extremely welcome, UNHCR’s new ((ul))((hl))Detention Guidelines alone are insufficient to address the severe problems((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) that characterise the detention of sexual minority migrants((/ul)). Ultimately, ((ul))states must provide alternatives to detention for all self-identifying sexual minorities – establishing non-custodial measures and alternative sentencing procedures.3 In addition, migrant detention facility staff and management must be trained on and sensitised to the protection needs of LGBTI migrants. Access to appropriate health-care, welfare and contact with the outside world – including legal counsel, medical attention and external LGBTI support systems – must be ensured. LGBTI detainee safety and the ending of discrimination and abuse, both by other detainees and by prison officials, must be the highest priority.((/ul))"],"stats":{"highlightedWords":168}},{"tag":"Outing DA: people who have to hide their identity aren’t granted asylum","cite":"Hanna ’05 Fadi Hanna 01/01/05 Fadi holds a law degree from Yale Law School, and a B.S from Duke University.

In articulating a demand to reverse cover, Soto Vega is not an outlier so much as the continuation of a disquieting trend in sexual-orientation-based asylum law. ((/ul))The case employs elements of the reasoning used in the landmark decision Hernandez-Montiel v. INS, in which the Ninth Circuit distinguished between subsets of the Mexican homosexual population. 14 The court granted the asylum application of a man who began dressing and acting like a woman at age twelve.' 5 It characterized his \"'particular social group'\" as \"[g]ay men with female sexual identities,\" which it called a \"subset of the gay male population,\"'16 and based its decision on the claim that female-acting homosexual men are subject to higher levels of abuse than male-acting homosexual men.' 7 The Ninth Circuit has since reconfirmed this reasoning, in Reyes-Reyes v. Ashcroft. 1 8 ((ul))In granting asylum to an effeminate gay man precisely because he was so effeminate, the Hernandez-Montiel court rewarded reverse covering. Standing alone, that decision said nothing about gay men who did cover; effeminacy simply helped to articulate the social group narrowly.19 But when the IJ in Soto Vega actually punished covering, the other shoe dropped. Taken together, Hernandez-Montiel and Soto Vega suggest that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))courts perceive gay asylum applicants on a covering spectrum stretching from those who \"act straight,\" or cover, to those who \"act gay,\" or reverse cover((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). Grants of sexual-orientation-based asylum increasingly depend on where the applicant lies on this covering spectrum.((/ul)) Soto Vega involved a gay man with a male sexual identity who was thus denied asylum. In Hernandez-Montiel and Reyes-Reyes, on the other hand, the applicants were effeminate, and so the courts looked on them more favorably.2 The rest of this Comment will argue that the covering-spectrum framework incorrectly assumes that homosexual men who cover are less vulnerable to persecution and unjustifiably treats gays who cover as a social group distinct from those who don't. The covering spectrum is fundamentally about visibility. Among asylum applicants, those who do not or cannot cover are more visibly gay, and are thus seen as more vulnerable to persecution and ultimately more deserving of asylum than those who cover. The visibility requirement is neither unique to asylum law21 nor, within it, to sexual-orientation-based asylum. Of the four enumerated grounds for asylum-race, nationality, religion, and political opinion22-the last two are likely to be invisible characteristics. Yet political asylum cases have considered it important that an individual was \"a highly visible member\" of the party or group whose opinions were disfavored.23 Similarly, for religious asylum, courts have considered whether the petitioner's religion can be \"readily identified., 24 Importing this reasoiing to the ill-defined social group category, 2 courts have observed that, like \"race, religion, nationality and political opinion[,] the attributes of a particular social group must be recognizable., 26 Visibility is not an independent requirement for asylum but a means of ascertaining whether persecution occurs \"on account of\" the protected characteristic.27 In asylum cases, a nexus must exist between an asylum applicant's persecution and his protected characteristic. To satisfy this requirement, courts have suggested that at a minimum, it is necessary that \"the persecutor could become aware\" of the protected characteristic. 28 Visibility is the most obvious and convenient way of showing that this possibility exists. Thus, in cases such as Reyes-Reyes, appearance becomes the requisite nexus between fear of persecution and homosexuality.29 It seems superficially reasonable to conclude that, for a gay individual who appears and acts heterosexual, sexuality will never trigger persecution. However, well-founded fear of persecution is the central inquiry in any asylum claim. Denying asylum to gays who cover overlooks the possibility that they hide their sexual identity out of fear of the persecution that would result if they did not. For many homosexuals, gay visibility is inversely related to fear; when fear increases, visibility decreases. 30 A study of homosexual persecution in Egypt documents how an increasing public awareness that \"colored underwear, long hair, and tattoos were all telltale signs\" of homosexuality led the gay community to avoid these things.31 In another case, fear of persecution led a homosexual couple in Bangladesh to \"conduct[] themselves in a discreet manner,\" 32 because being conspicuous would lead to \"the possibility of being bashed by the police. 33 In these cases, invisibility, not visibility, serves as a nexus between the individual's fear of persecution and his homosexuality.34 When covering is the result of fear,35 denial of asylum based even in part on gay visibility contravenes the central goal of asylum law. Sexualorientation-based asylum seeks to protect a person's right to be homosexual when threatened by fear of official persecution.36 If we accept that covering is burdensome for gay individuals, 37 any voluntary assumption of this burden is then arguably evidence that a well-founded fear exists. Covering motivated by fear-what I call \"reactionary covering\"-is, in fact, more than mere evidence of fear of persecution: It constitutes persecution. Although the cases discussed thus far have dealt with \"gay\" traits (such as effeminate dress or bearing), \"gay\" acts (such as homosexual sex) can also reveal one's sexual orientation. As a result, covering can lead to the avoidance of all emotional and physical contact with the same sex, both public and private. When fear forces a gay individual to live like a straight one, covering approaches outright conversion, which has been seen by American courts as persecution that meets the fear-based standard.38 The High Court of Australia has taken the next logical step and recognized reactionary covering as grounds for granting asylum. 39 Treating covering as grounds to deny asylum, as in Soto Vega, is a troubling anomaly that needs to be undone. That the visibility requirement for sexual-orientation-based asylum overlooks the possibility of reactionary covering is reason enough to abandon it. More fundamentally, however, the problem with the visibility requirement is that it conceptualizes homosexual identity in a way that is inconsistent with the immutability element of asylum law. In Soto Vega and other cases that apply the covering spectrum, judges assume that sexual orientation is expressed through action-through the doing of all those \"stereotypical things that society assesses to gays. 4 ° In placing applicants along a covering spectrum, the absence of gay behavior becomes indicative of a fundamental difference in gay identity. Within the framework of asylum law, however, one is either gay or not. Homosexuality is not treated as a behavior that is subject to gradations, but as an immutable trait. Several circuits, along with the BIA, have held that an immutable characteristic is sufficient to establish a particular social group.41 It is on this basis that homosexuals are recognized as a particular social group: homosexuality is immutable.42 An immutability-based legal standard for those persecuted on the basis of their sexual orientation must recognize that while some gay people are capable of resisting any expression of that orientation, they are still gay and not necessarily immune from fear of persecution. While the link between action and identity has been emphasized in other contexts,43 it has no place in sexual-orientation-based asylum. A \"performative model\"' 4 4 of identity would suggest that someone cannot be eligible for asylum on the grounds of sexual orientation unless he manifests his orientation through his appearance or behavior. This is not how homosexuality has been treated in asylum law. In In re Acosta, the BIA defined an immutable characteristic as one that individuals \"either cannot change, or should not be required to change. 45 It is their core sexual identity, separate from action, that immigration courts have long recognized the inability of gay men to change.46 When courts deny asylum to gay individuals who do not act gay, using a performative model, they wrongly assume that homosexual identity is constituted by action.47 When gender-conforming homosexuals are less intensely persecuted in a specific country, it does not negate the fact that they are fundamentally persecuted for their homosexuality. 48 Crucially, immutable homosexual identity is distinct from social perception of what is \"gay.\" A performative model contravenes the immutability standard because it relies on variable social and cultural perceptions 49 of what actions characterize homosexuality. American courts, driven by the immutability requirement, should focus on that which is temporally and culturally constant-an applicant's core homosexual identity. The sexual identity that asylum law seeks to protect is unchanged by covering and unrelated to visibility.

This information reveals that LGBT immigrants are being held in detention for long periods of time, in unsafe conditions, and at a far greater risk of sexual violence than the general population.((/ul)) These facts indicate that Laura’s story is not unique under the Trump administration’s policy of treating every unauthorized immigrant as a deportation priority. ((ul))((hl))LGBT immigrants in detention report high rates of sexual assault and sexual abuse((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))ICE’s 2014 Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) regulations require an annual publication of sexual assault data. Making the data publicly available is important as a means of helping advocates hold ICE accountable for its response to sexual assault in detention. While ICE has not yet publicly released any of the required annual data since 2014, Rep. Rice requested data from ICE on sexual assault of people in detention, and these findings are staggering—even compared with the high rate of sexual victimization of LGBT people in U.S. jails and prisons((/ul)). ICE reported to Rep. Rice that it received 227 reports of sexual abuse and assault in FY 2017. Twenty-eight of these reports involved an LGBT victim. In FY 2017, ICE detained 323,591 people. ICE reported to Rep. Rice that in FY 2017, 467 immigrants disclosed being LGBT during intake to a detention facility. This means that although LGBT people were 0.14 percent of the people ICE detained in FY 2017, they accounted for 12 percent of victims of sexual abuse and assault in ICE detention that year. In other words, assuming each report of sexual violence is substantiated and involves a separate victim, LGBT people in ICE custody are 97 times more likely to be sexually victimized than non-LGBT people in detention. ((ul))((hl))ICE is housing transgender immigrants in unsafe situations((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))ICE is placing LGBT immigrants in harm’s way by not releasing them from detention when they should be and has reverted to its practice of detaining transgender women with men or in solitary confinement, contrary to its own rules((/ul)). In recognition of their heightened vulnerability to sexual abuse, DHS’ PREA rule requires an individualized placement determination for transgender people. In its response to Rep. Rice, ICE claims it is making these assessments. However, the custody data that Rep. Rice received indicate this is not the case. ((ul))((hl))Despite the continued existence of an Obama-era memo on caring for transgender immigrants, not one of the nearly 250 facilities ICE detains immigrants in is bound to comply with this guidance. Rather than automatically applying across DHS detention facilities, this guidance requires a contractual agreement with the facility((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). ICE opened a pod for transgender immigrants in Cibola County, New Mexico, but that facility’s contract with ICE does not include a requirement that it comply with the transgender care memo((/ul)). ICE reported to Rep. Rice that it detains transgender women in 17 facilities. Four are all-male facilities. Thirteen have a mix of male and female populations. Except for the transgender pod at Cibola, ICE has not provided information about whether ICE detained transgender women with other women, with men, or in isolation in these facilities. The average amount of time transgender people were detained in FY 2017 was 99 days, more than double the 43.7 day average all immigrants spent in ICE custody. With nearly 80 countries criminalizing LGBT people, the extended period of time they spend in detention may be due to waiting for a judge to review their cases for relief from deportation, such as asylum. Rep. Rice’s office also obtained information about the use of solitary confinement for LGBT immigrants in detention. In recognition of the risks that come with placing vulnerable populations, such as LGBT people, in solitary confinement, ICE’s own rules stipulate that solitary should only be used as a last resort. In those cases, solitary confinement should “not ordinarily exceed a period of 30 days.” According to Rep. Rice’s office, 1 in 8 transgender people detained by ICE were placed in solitary confinement in FY 2017. The United Nations recognizes the placement of LGBT people in solitary confinement for their own protection as a form of torture. After 15 days, solitary confinement may cause irreversible psychological damage. According to the information that ICE provided Rep. Rice, LGBT immigrants who were detained in solitary for more than 14 days spent an average of 52 days in solitary confinement."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":69}},{"tag":"Abuse is rampant – the aff’s mechanism is amoral ","cite":"Hananel 18","text":["5-30-18 Sam Hananel - Associate Director of Media Relations at Center for American Progress. “RELEASE: LGBT Immigrants in Detention Centers at Severe Risk of Sexual Abuse, CAP Analysis Says” https://www.americanprogress.org/press/release/2018/05/30/451380/release-lgbt-immigrants-detention-centers-severe-risk-sexual-abuse-cap-analysis-says/","((ul))Disturbing new government data shows that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))LGBT immigrants held at federal detention centers are 97 times more likely to be sexually assaulted than other detainees,((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) according to an analysis by the Center for American Progress.((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))The CAP analysis is based on data from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that was requested by Rep.

Oscar is a regular contributor to Newsweek magazine, where he often writes about LGBT rights. His work has also been featured on Huffington Post, Narratively, and Posture Magazine. “For LGBTQ Refugees in the United States, “Visibility is a Two-Sided Sword”” http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2017/06/28/for_lgbtq_refugees_to_the_u_s_newfound_visibility_can_be_problematic.html","((ul))Growing up in a small town in Nigeria, Oliver Anene had always tried to make his sexuality invisible.((/ul)) “Kissing a guy on the street would be suicide,” says the 33-year-old on the phone from New York City, where he now lives. “It was difficult to hide.” ((ul))Still, that didn’t stop him from fighting for equality((/ul)): When he moved to the capital city of Abuja, he began to campaign for LGBTQ rights with a local organization called Alliance Rights Nigeria. But the anonymity of a being in a big city didn’t last long: During World AIDS Day in 2005, Anene says Nigeria’s then-president was visiting a health fair in Abuja where ARN had a booth. “One of the reporters yelled ‘Are you gay?’ ” Anene recalls. “The head of our organization admitted ‘Yeah, I’m gay’ on national TV. That was the beginning of the backlash.” Anene says that this moment of queer visibility ignited a national movement to crackdown on LGBTQ expression, despite the fact that gay sex was already illegal. The campaign culminated in the Same-Sex Marriage Prohibition Act of 2014, which imposes a 10-year prison sentence on anyone who “registers, operates or participates in gay clubs, societies, and organization.” The public persecution made Anene’s work increasingly risky: “I tried to keep a low profile,” he says. “But when you show up on the news, it starts to get really dangerous.” After being harassed and receiving multiple death threats, Anene says he began to fear for his life. So, during a visit to the United States five years ago, he reached out to Immigration Equality, a New York–based nonprofit organization that provides free legal representation to LGBTQ people, and began the process of seeking asylum. “My mom has a saying,” he says. “ ‘He who fights and runs away, lives to fight another day.’ ” ((ul))Like Anene, thousands of people around the world are forced to flee their home country every year because of their sexual orientation or gender identity, and an increasing number end up in the United States.((/ul)) According to a 2012 report from the Heartland Alliance, an estimated 3,500 LGBTQ refugees arrive in the U.S. annually: Every year, 1,250 queer people are granted asylum. ((ul))But attaining refugee status is a complex and difficult journey, throughout which asylum-seekers like Anene must constantly negotiate visibility. Because while being out back home could get you killed or thrown in jail, during the asylum process, visibility can be the only way to prove you need protection. And even if their claim is successful, LGBTQ refugees are forced to confront the reality of a country that can often be hostile to immigrants, queers, and people of color.((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))“((/ul))((ul))((hl))Visibility is a double-sided sword((/hl))((/ul))((ul)),”((/ul)) says Siobhán McGuirk, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University whose research focuses on migration and sexuality. “((ul))((hl))Being visible becomes necessary for a case, but ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))it also puts people at risk((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).”((/ul)) Under international asylum law, to qualify for refugee status, asylum-seekers need to prove that they are members of a minority group and have a “well-founded fear of persecution.” To prove their membership to this marginalized group, in this case being LGBTQ, refugees have to show both visibility and immutability—the fact that their status is unchanging. “I don’t know what ‘looking gay’ means—it’s ridiculous.” Oliver Anene ((ul))But for LGBTQ asylum-seekers, both of these criteria can be problematic. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Immutability often discounts people that are bisexual or sexually fluid,((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) says McGuirk, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))and as for visibility, “Why would anyone be visible if visibility means persecution or death?”((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) But in an interview with an adjudicator, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))asylum-((/hl))((/ul))((ul))seekers are required to offer evidence of their sexuality or gender identity.((/ul)) “You might be asked for photos of you and your partner,” says Jackie Yodashkin, Public Affairs Director at Immigration Equality. “But often people don’t take them, and why would you keep them when it’s so dangerous?” Anene, from Nigeria, was lucky. While the visibility of his activism made him a target in Nigeria, it afforded him ample evidence for his asylum case, and his refugee status was approved relatively quickly. But for many people, the process can be much longer and more difficult. “((ul))Sometimes it ((/ul))((ul))((hl))hinges on telling your story((/hl))((/ul)),” says Yodashkin. “People get asked really invasive questions. It can be a harrowing process of recounting persecution.” Marja, 33, is a gay woman from Eastern Europe, where she was constantly trying to hide who she was: “I became a master of deflection,” she says. But eventually, the fear of being found out became too much. “I had to find an escape to save myself, to save my sanity, my life.” Diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder, she is seeking asylum in the U.S. But putting together her case has meant reliving the trauma she was trying to leave behind. “I came here to forget and to heal, so it’s hard to go through everything again,” she says. “It’s emotionally exhausting. The burden on top of the mountain of burdens.” ((ul))McGuirk, the Georgetown professor, says ((/ul))((ul))((hl))asylum-seekers must also confront preconceived notions of what an LGBTQ person looks like((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) in the interview process: “Being out and proud is understood in a very homonormative, mainstream way,” she says. According to Anene, such attitudes mean asylum-seekers may try to conform to an adjudicator's stereotyped expectations. “The other day a friend was asking me if he should wear makeup or a dress to the interview to look more gay,” he says with a laugh.((/ul)) “I don’t know what ‘looking gay’ means—it’s ridiculous.” While attitudes like these are improving in places like New York or San Francisco with large queer communities, McGuirk says that in the South, it can be more challenging to get past these kinds of outdated ideas about queer visibility: “The differences can be quite shocking,” she says. “There’s no consistency across asylum adjudication.” According to the report from Heartland Alliance, in 2010, there were 4,168 LGBT asylees living in California, versus just 263 in Texas. And while the national average for asylum approval is 48 percent, in states like Georgia it can be as low as 2 percent. This disparity disproportionately affects Latinx asylum-seekers, who are more likely to arrive as undocumented by crossing into the U.S. over land, and it privileges more financially stable refugees who can fly into places like New York. ((ul))((hl))Among those((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) undocumented LGBTQ ((/ul))((ul))((hl))people((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) who do make it into the U.S., McGuirk says that all too often, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))they are thrown in detention((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents ((/ul))((ul))((hl))before even knowing that asylum is an option((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).((/hl)) “((ul))They’re immediately forced into the defensive((/ul)),” she says. A report from the Center for American Progress titled \"ICE Officers Overwhelmingly Use Their Discretion to Detain LGBT Immigrants\" found that “LGBT immigrants were detained with startling regularity regardless of legal requirements, vulnerability to abuse, or even the absence of flight risk or risk to public safety.” Immigration activists fear this could get worse under the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. “People are scared to go to Pride this year,” says Yodashkin. “They’re scared to be visible.” ((ul))If detained, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))trans women especially face much greater dangers than cisgender immigrants((/hl))((/ul))((ul)): A November 2013 Government Accountability Office report found that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))one-fifth of confirmed sexual assault cases((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) between 2009 and 2013 in detention facilities ((/ul))((ul))((hl))involved trans immigrants((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) “It’s dangerous for anyone to be in an immigration detention center,” says Yodashkin. “But trans folks are especially targeted for violence. It’s just not a safe place.” ICE has attempted to address this issues by placing trans people in special individual pods, but this can lead to isolation, and, according to the CAP report, “even with this precaution, abuse persists.” The Trump administration’s travel ban, recently reinstated by the Supreme Court until it can consider the order’s constitutionality in October, is another major concern for LGBTQ asylum-seekers. The executive order, which bars entry to anyone from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, or Yemen and places a 120-day ban on refugees, could be particularly damaging to LGBTQ people, who may be fleeing anti-gay laws and persecution in these countries. “It disproportionately affects queer people,” says Yodashkin of the travel ban. “And it could leave people stuck in countries where it’s not safe. We’re talking about life or death here.” ((ul))“((/ul))((ul))((hl))People get asked really invasive questions. It can be a harrowing process.”((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))Jackie Yodashkin ((ul))But even for those asylum-seekers lucky enough to gain entry to the U.S. and have their asylum claim filed, meaning they can legally remain in the U.S. during processing, the hardship is far from over: Unlike in countries like the U.K., the U.S. government doesn’t offer any kind of financial support during the asylum process, and without legal access to work, asylum-seekers often end up on the street((/ul))((ul)). “((/ul))((ul))((hl))People are forced into being visible by the system,” says McGuirk. “But they’re not given the kind of complex support they need((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).”((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))With nowhere to go after filing his asylum claim, Anene, the Nigerian refugee, ended up in a homeless shelter in New York. “It was terrifying,” he says. “The term ‘faggot’ was thrown around a lot. I was fleeing Nigeria so I could stop hiding who I was, and here I was again trying to pretend to be straight.” Marja was lucky: She got taken in by a lesbian couple for her first few months in the U.S. “Seeing how they as a couple were so accepted by society, in a church setting, was extremely beneficial,” says Marja. “The beginning of stopping to hate myself for being gay. To see that you can be loved.” Once she got her work permit, Marja was able to find a steady job and move into her own place: She now lives with a gay Russian couple who are also applying for asylum. But working hasn’t been without difficulties. “I have a lot of coworkers who come from countries with similar views towards gay people,” she says. “I’m not comfortable being out and proud.” This, too, is common: According to Scott Pohl, Senior Community-Based Protection Advisor for UNHCR, LGBTQ refugees can often face discrimination even within immigrant communities: “When people flee, the stigma that they experienced prior to their flight can come with them.” After spending three months in the homeless shelter, Anene’s asylum application was accepted: that year, he marched in New York Pride for the first time. “To say we are Nigerians and we’re gay in public was so overwhelming,” he says. “To represent Nigerians and other Africans was elating.” He’s gone to every New York Pride since. But according to Yodashkin, marching in Pride and ((ul))being so visible may be too big a step for some asylum-seekers: “A lot of people just aren’t ready,” she says. “((/ul))((ul))((hl))It can feel like you’re lining up to be a target.”((/hl))((/ul)) Marja says that she went to Pride in Washington, D.C. this year, and while she enjoyed watching it, she didn’t feel comfortable marching in the parade. “I guess I’m not OK with being gay—it’s part of the healing process,” she says. “I feel part of the gay community, but the part that’s not loud and proud.” Others face even greater challenges at Pride events that have become increasingly mainstream. McGuirk says she’s spoken to many LGBTQ Muslims who are “appalled by the comments made to them” at Pride events. “LGBTQ Muslims do want to engage and talk about transphobia and homophobia in their community,” she says. “But they’re also forced to talk about Islamophobia and transphobia in the gay community, and that can be very draining.” Anene, too, admits that “gay culture can be overwhelming.” But for him, the most difficult part of living in the U.S. has been confronting racism. “When you grow up in Africa as a gay man, that’s the only difference you have,” he says. “The color of your skin isn’t important. Then you move here and you start to see the inequality that’s happening.” For McGuirk, this is a part of the conversation on asylum that too often gets left out. “Being a black immigrant who is also LGBT, the U.S. is not a safe place for you,” she says. Yodashkin agrees: “There are so many different levels of discrimination that people have to navigate. It’s always a dance.” Despite his background in activism, Anene and his Nigerian friends found it hard at first to relate to the Black Lives Matter movement: “We don’t consider ourselves African American,” he says. “We didn’t feel like we should engage in the conversation.” But after experiencing discrimination firsthand too many times, Anene began to realize that racism doesn’t discriminate. “The system is rigged to deprive people of color of a healthy life,” he says. “A police officer isn’t going to be like ‘Oh, you’re from Africa, you’re OK.’ It’s not going to happen.” Still, Anene’s main focus continues to be LGBTQ rights, and he is working with and volunteering at several organizations in New York. But ultimately he wants to return to Nigeria, as soon as he gets American citizenship. “Going with a U.S. passport will offer me some protection, so I can get more involved, be louder,” he says. “Hopefully one day Nigeria will become more accepting. But people have to fight for it. That’s why I have to go back.” "],"stats":{"highlightedWords":143}},{"tag":"((hl))No war – leaders have incentives to contain escalation – any claim to the contrary assumes the old guard((/hl))  ","cite":"((hl))Malin 12((/hl)) [Martin Malin is the Executive Director on Project on Managing the Atom at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard, 5-28-2012, “Unconventional Wisdom”, The Bulletin,  http://thebulletin.org/unconventional-wisdom] ","text":["((ul))As negotiations with Iran over the future of its nuclear program inch toward a possible deal, another intractable Middle East problem with a nuclear dimension is likely to start getting more serious attention. It is the question of whether there is any chance that Israel, Iran, and their Arab neighbors will agree to discuss establishing a regional zone free of all nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and their delivery systems((/ul)).¶ Earlier this month in Vienna, Jaakko Laajava, a Finnish diplomat and the facilitator of the proposed 2012 Middle East WMD-Free Zone Conference, reported to the Non-Proliferation Treaty preparatory committee meeting that although he had conducted more than 100 meetings -- both inside and outside the region -- he had yet to secure an agreement from all relevant states on participation. News of Laajava's no-news statement was met with another round of eye-rolling and finger-pointing: ((ul))The likely holdouts are Israel and Iran, with a major question mark hanging over Syrian participation.((/ul))¶ After decades of backsliding, proliferation, and conflict in the Middle East, ((ul))the conventional wisdom says the current round of efforts will fail.((/ul)) I think ((ul))the conventional wisdom is wrong.((/ul))¶ ((ul))In the past, many leaders in the Middle East have seen chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons as an attractive answer to their problems. But this logic is changing.((/ul)) ((ul))Developments in the region are creating conditions that make progress on arms control and disarmament more possible, not less.((/ul))¶ Reviewing matters within. Internal conditions throughout the Middle East are becoming less conducive for either sparking or sustaining WMD programs. Arab protesters are demanding less corruption and more government accountability. Large, secretive WMD programs supporting unaccountable military-industrial cliques will be harder to support in the region's emerging political economies((hl)).((/hl)) ((ul))((hl))The domestic political struggles underway across the Middle East have both leaders in power and their opponents focusing inward on reform, not outward toward old enemies((/hl))((/ul)).¶ ((ul))If democratic processes begin to take root ((/ul))(and, admittedly, it is premature to say that they will), ((ul))what effect will this have on the perceived role of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons? ((/ul))Research by political scientists Harald Müller and Andreas Schmidt suggests that democratizing states, in need of international acceptance and support, are particularly sensitive to nonproliferation norms and loathe to violate them.¶ ((ul))((hl))Regional evolution. The region's historic military rivalries have receded and the security rationale for WMD is receding with them((/hl))((/ul)). Iraq, which was once Iran's bitterest enemy and in US crosshairs for its WMD programs (real and imagined), now closely coordinates its policies with both Tehran and Washington. ((ul))Tension in the Saudi-Iranian relationship requires the attention of leaders in Riyadh and Tehran, but in no way resembles the military rivalry that once existed between Iran and Iraq.((/ul))((ul))¶((/ul))((ul)) Inter-Arab animosity has also moderated.((/ul)) In April, when demonstrations erupted outside its embassy in Cairo, Saudi Arabia quickly withdrew its ambassador, Ahmed Qattan. But within a week, Riyadh reinstated Qattan and promised a major aid package to Egypt. Contrast that incident with Saudi-Egyptian relations in the 1960s, when Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser deployed his country's troops in Yemen to defeat Saudi proxies and used poison gas to do the job. Times have changed¶ T((ul))he Arab-Israeli conflict, the original driver of Israel's nuclear weapons program, has been reduced((/ul)) to two issues: the core question of Israeli-Palestinian relations and the future of the Golan Heights. ((ul))Although ((/ul))each problem ((ul))is vexing, neither is any longer the spark that can ignite region-wide conflict and threaten Israel's very existence.((/ul)) Israel's peace with Egypt may cool even further, but neither of Egypt's presidential candidates calls for abrogating the treaty because the treaty is as much an anchor of Egypt's national security as it is of Israel's.¶ Israeli and Iranian calculations. As Israel considers how best to secure its future, it must choose among three strategic options.¶ ((ul))Israel can try to extend its nuclear monopoly by attacking or sabotaging the nuclear projects of Iran and perhaps other states down the road. This option((/ul)), Israel's policy for the past several decades, ((ul))is becoming increasingly untenable. In the short- to medium-term, bombing carries the risk of retaliation, and the unintended consequence of fueling the nuclear ambitions it is trying to stamp out.((/ul)) And Israel can only bomb what it knows about. But the long-term problem is more profound: Can Israel sustain a policy of militarily preventing nuclear development in a neighborhood of growing interest in nuclear power and a progressive diffusion of technology?¶ Israel's second option -- deterrence -- carries the price of eventually abandoning nuclear ambiguity, since maintaining an active deterrent through periods of crisis and change in Iranian capabilities will require explicit statements and even demonstrations of Israeli capability. Such demonstrations will threaten and provoke Arab states in a way that Israel's nuclear weapons now do not, further raising the costs and risks of deterrence.¶ In light of the above choices, Israel may come to see the third option as the least unpalatable: Entering into negotiations with its neighbors to establish rules for limiting the possession of WMD across the region, eventually putting its own capabilities on the negotiating table. Discussing a WMD-free zone would allow Israel to prolong its nuclear weapons monopoly with the fewest challenges for an interim period, while negotiating the terms of a transition to a nuclear and WMD free Middle East. It can also use a forum on regional arms control as a venue to raise its concerns about proliferation elsewhere in the region.¶ Iran has important security interests in pursuing a WMD-free zone. Tehran has a long-term strategic interest in denuclearizing Israel, and, odious as it might seem to Iran's leaders, direct negotiations with Israel on regional security and a WMD ban are the only way to do that. Iran would find other security benefits from engaging diplomatically on the issue: ((ul))((hl))Regional security discussions can help Iran break out of its isolation.((/hl))((/ul)) In WMD-free zone discussions, Iran can split the US-Arab coalition against it and focus attention on Israel's nuclear weapons. ((ul))((hl))The creation of a zone -- if it were to occur in the next several years -- would leave Iran far ahead of its Arab neighbors in its nuclear knowledge and experience, preserving an important security hedge, while reducing the incentives for its neighbors to attempt to match its expensive fuel-cycle investment((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul))((ul))¶((/ul)) Wild cards. If the current P5+1 negotiations with Tehran collapse and Israel or the United States attack Iran, then both the political and security justifications for proliferation will be reinforced across the region. Voices within Iran calling for an operational deterrent will gain traction. And similar arguments will reverberate in Riyadh, Cairo, and possibly elsewhere. Failure of the proposal to hold a conference in 2012 on a Middle East WMD-free zone will be the least of concerns.¶ ((ul))Syria also presents potential problems. In the short-term, having suspended its membership in the Arab League for its violent crackdown on protesters, many Arab states would prefer not to reward the Assad regime with a platform at a conference to discuss weapons of mass destruction. In the long-term, competitive external intervention in a Syrian civil war could help reverse the trends supporting the move toward WMD disarmament.((/ul)) Syrian behavior, together with its chemical weapons stocks, should remind everyone why the discussion of a WMD-free zone and regional security more broadly in the Middle East is urgent. The short-term political costs of Syrian participation are trivial by comparison.¶ Predictions. In capitals across the Middle East, policy makers will soon be pressed for their responses to a proposal to meet in Finland to discuss a regional WMD ban, possibly in December. Though Tehran and Jerusalem will grasp at old arguments to insist that the idea is foolish or unnecessary, a cold, hard look at emerging security interests in the new Middle East will take a bite out of old dogmas. Invitations to Helsinki will bring Israel and Iran to the negotiation table. Undoubtedly((ul)), the process will be long and frustrating.

It is part of an attempt to make critical evaluation an intrinsic element of responsibility. Responsibility to this more fundamental ethic gives the ethic of consequences meaning. Consequentialism and responsibility are here drawn into what Schluchter, in terms that will be familiar to anyone conversant with constructivism in International Relations, has called a 'reflexive principle'. In the wilful Realist vision, ((ul))scepticism and consequentialism are linked in an attempt to construct not just ((/ul))a more substantial vision of ((ul))political responsibility, but also the kinds of actors who might adopt it, and the kinds of social structures that might support it((/ul)). A consequentialist ethic is not simply a choice adopted by actors: it is a means of trying to foster particular kinds of self-critical individuals and societies, and in so doing to encourage a means by which one can justify and foster a politics of responsibility. ((ul))The ethic ((/ul))of responsibility in wilful Realism ((ul))thus involves a commitment to both autonomy and limitation, to freedom and restraint, to an acceptance of limits and the criticism of limits((/ul)). Responsibility clearly involves prudence and an accounting for current structures and their historical evolution; but it is not limited to this, for it seeks ultimately the creation of responsible subjects within a philosophy of limits. Seen in this light, the Realist commitment to objectivity appears quite differently. Objectivity in terms of consequentialist analysis does not simply take the actor or action as given, it is a political practice — an attempt to foster a responsible self, undertaken by an analyst with a commitment to objectivity which is itself based in a desire to foster a politics of responsibility. ((ul))Objectivity in the sense of coming to terms with the 'reality' of contextual conditions and likely outcomes ((/ul))of action ((ul))is not only necessary for success, it is vital for self-reflection, for sustained engagement with the practical and ethical adequacy of one's views((/ul)). The blithe, self-serving, and ((ul))((hl))uncritical stances of abstract moralism((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))or rationalist objectivism ((ul))((hl))avoid self-criticism by refusing to engage with the intractability of the world 'as it is'. Reducing the world to an expression of their ((/hl))((/ul))((hl))t((/hl))heoretical models, political platforms, or ((ul))((hl))ideological programmes, they fail to engage with this reality, and thus avoid the process of self-reflection at the heart of responsibility((/hl))((/ul)). By contrast, Realist objectivity takes an engagement with this intractable 'object' that is not reducible to one's wishes or will as a necessary condition of ethical engagement, self-reflection, and self-creation.7 Objectivity is not a naive naturalism in the sense of scientific laws or rationalist calculation; it is a necessary engagement with a world that eludes one's will. ((ul))((hl))A recognition of the limits imposed by 'reality' is a condition for a recognition of one's own limits — that the world is not simply an extension of one's own will((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).((/hl)) ((ul))But it is also a challenge to use that intractability as a source of possibility, as providing a set of openings ((/ul))within which a suitably chastened and yet paradoxically energised will to action can responsibly be pursued. In the wilful Realist tradition, the essential opacity of both the self and the world are taken as limiting principles. ((ul))Limits upon understanding ((/ul))provide chastening parameters for claims about the world and actions within it. But they also ((ul))provide challenging and creative openings within which diverse forms of life can be developed: the limited unity of the self and the political order is the precondition for freedom. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))The ((/hl))((/ul))ultimate((hl)) ((/hl))((ul))((hl))opacity of the world is not to be despaired of: it is a condition of possibility for the wilful, creative construction of selves and social orders which embrace the diverse human potentialities((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))which this lack of essential or intrinsic order makes possible.8 But it is also to be aware of the less salutary possibilities this involves.

Any number of policies might work, and others, although seemingly consistent with the moral principle, will fail utterly. That deontological principles are an inadequate basis for environmental policy is evident in the rather significant irony that most forms of deontologically based environmental laws and regulations tend to be implemented in a very utilitarian manner by street-level enforcement officials. Moreover, ignoring the relevant costs and benefits of environmental policy and their attendant incentive structures can, as alluded to above, actually work at cross purposes to environmental preservation. (There exists an extensive literature on this aspect of regulatory enforcement and the often perverse outcomes of regulatory policy. See, for example, Ackerman, 1981; Bartrip and Fenn, 1983; Hawkins, 1983, 1984; Hawkins and Thomas, 1984.)

The answer is that we did not, as Hume and Moore anticipated, attempt to derive an \"ought\" from and \"is.\" That is, our method has been inductive rather than deductive. We have inferred on the basis of the available evidence that the phenomenon of rationalist deontological philosophy is best explained as a rationalization of evolved emotional intuition (Harman, 1977).((ul)) Missing the Deontological Point ((/ul))I suspect that ((ul))rationalist((/ul)) ((ul))((hl))deontologists((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) will remain unmoved((/ul)) ((ul))by the arguments presented here((/ul)).

It's about treating others as fellow rational creatures rather than as mere objects, about acting for reasons rational beings can share. And so on (Korsgaard, 1996a; Korsgaard, 1996b).((ul))This is, no doubt, how many deontologists see deontology.

((ul))Consider the following analogy with religion. When one asks a religious person to explain the essence of his religion, one often gets an answer like this: \"It's about love((/ul)), really. It's about looking out for other people, looking beyond oneself. It's about community, being part of something larger than oneself.\" ((ul))This sort of answer accurately captures the phenomenology of many people's religion, but it's nevertheless inadequate for distinguishing religion from other things((/ul)). This is because many, if not most, non-religious people aspire to love deeply, look out for other people, avoid self-absorption, have a sense of a community, and be connected to things larger than themselves. In other words, secular humanists and atheists can assent to most of what many religious people think religion is all about. From a secular humanist's point of view, in contrast, what's distinctive about religion is its commitment to the existence of supernatural entities as well as formal religious institutions and doctrines. And they're right. These things really do distinguish religious from non-religious practices, though they may appear to be secondary to many people operating from within a religious point of view. In the same way, I believe that most of ((ul))((hl))the standard((/hl))((/ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((ul))((hl))deontological/Kantian self-characterizatons((/hl))((/ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((ul))((hl))fail to distinguish deontology from other approaches to ethics((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).((/hl)) (See also Kagan (Kagan, 1997, pp. 70-78.) on the difficulty of defining deontology.)

This is not to say that consequentialists and deontologists don't differ. They do. It's just that the real differences may not be what deontologists often take them to be. What, then, distinguishes deontology from other kinds of moral thought? A good strategy for answering this question is to start with concrete disagreements between deontologists and others (such as consequentialists) and then work backward in search of deeper principles. This is what I've attempted to do with the trolley and footbridge cases, and other instances in which deontologists and consequentialists disagree.

((ul))((hl))The self stretches towards the Other, as life stretches towards the future; neither can grasp what it stretches toward, but it is in this hopeful and desperate, never conclusive and never abandoned stretching((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))‑((/hl))((/ul))toward that the self is ever anew created and life ever anew lived((ul))((hl)).((/hl))((/ul)) In the words of M. M. Bakhtin, it is only in this not‑yet accomplished world of anticipation and trial, leaning toward stubbornly an‑other Other, that life can be lived ‑ not in the world of the `events that occurred'; in the latter world, `it is impossible to live, to act responsibly; in it, I am not needed, in principle I am not there at all.\" Art, the Other, the future: what unites them, what makes them into three words vainly trying to grasp the same mystery, is the modality of possibility. A curious modality, at home neither in ontology nor epistemology; itself, like that which it tries to catch in its net, `always outside', forever `otherwise than being'. The possibility we are talking about here is not the all‑too‑familiar unsure‑of‑itself, and through that uncertainty flawed, inferior and incomplete being, disdainfully dismissed by triumphant existence as `mere possibility', `just a possibility'; possibility is instead `plus que la reahte' ‑ both the origin and the foundation of being. The hope, says Blanchot, proclaims the possibility of that which evades the possible; `in its limit, this is the hope of the bond recaptured where it is now lost.\"' The hope is always the hope of being fu filled, but what keeps the hope alive and so keeps the being open and on the move is precisely its unfu filment. One may say that the paradox of hope (and the paradox of possibility founded in hope) is that it may pursue its destination solely through betraying its nature; the most exuberant of energies expends itself in the urge towards rest. Possibility uses up its openness in search of closure. Its image of the better being is its own impoverishment . . . The togetherness of the being‑for is cut out of the same block; it shares in the paradoxical lot of all possibility. It lasts as long as it is unfulfilled, yet it uses itself up in never ending effort of fulfilment, of recapturing the bond, making it tight and immune to all future temptations. In an important, perhaps decisive sense, it is selfdestructive and self‑defeating: its triumph is its death. The Other, like restless and unpredictable art, like the future itself, is a mystery. And being‑for‑the‑Other, going towards the Other through the twisted and rocky gorge of affection, brings that mystery into view ‑ makes it into a challenge. That mystery is what has triggered the sentiment in the first place ‑ but cracking that mystery is what the resulting movement is about. The mystery must be unpacked so that the being‑for may focus on the Other: one needs to know what to focus on. (The `demand' is unspoken, the responsibility undertaken is unconditional; it is up to him or her who follows the demand and takes up the responsibility to decide what the following of that demand and carrying out of that responsibility means in practical terms.) Mystery ‑ noted Max Frisch ‑ (and the Other is a mystery), is an exciting puzzle, but one tends to get tired of that excitement. `And so one creates for oneself an image. This is a loveless act, the betrayal.\" Creating an image of the Other leads to the substitution of the image for the Other; the Other is now fixed ‑ soothingly and comfortingly. There is nothing to be excited about anymore. I know what the Other needs, I know where my responsibility starts and ends. Whatever the Other may now do will be taken down and used against him. What used to be received as an exciting surprise now looks more like perversion; what used to be adored as exhilarating creativity now feels like wicked levity. Thanatos has taken over from Eros, and the excitement of the ungraspable turned into the dullness and tedium of the grasped. But, as Gyorgy Lukacs observed, `everything one person may know about another is only expectation, only potentiality, only wish or fear, acquiring reality only as a result of what happens later, and this reality, too, dissolves straightaway into potentialities'. ((ul))Only death, with its finality and irreversibility, puts an end to((/ul)) the musical‑chairs game of ((ul))the real and the potential ((/ul))((ul))‑((/ul)) it once and for all closes the embrace of togetherness which was before invitingly ((ul))open ((/ul))and tempted the lonely self.\" `Creating an image' is the dress rehearsal of that death. But creating an image is the inner urge, the constant temptation, the must of all affection . . . It is the loneliness of being abandoned to an unresolvable ambivalence and an unanchored and formless sentiment which sets in motion the togetherness of being‑for. But what loneliness seeks in togetherness is an end to its present condition ‑ an end to itself. Without knowing ‑ without being capable of knowing ‑ that the hope to replace the vexing loneliness with togetherness is founded solely on its own unfulfilment, and that once loneliness is no more, the togetherness ( the being‑for togetherness) must also collapse, as it cannot survive its own completion. What the loneliness seeks in togetherness (suicidally for its own cravings) is the foreclosing and pre‑empting of the future, cancelling the future before it comes, robbing it of mystery but also of the possibility with which it is pregnant. Unknowingly yet necessarily, it seeks it all to its own detriment, since the success (if there is a success) may only bring it back to where it started and to the condition which prompted it to start on the journey in the first place. ((ul))The togetherness of being((/ul))((ul))‑((/ul))for is always in the future, and nowhere else. It is no more once the self proclaims: `I have arrived', `I have done it', `I fulfilled my duty.' The being‑for starts from the realization of the bottomlessness of the task, and ends with the declaration that the infinity has been exhausted. ((ul))This is the tragedy of being((/ul))((ul))‑((/ul))for ((ul))‑((/ul)) the reason why it cannot but be death((ul))‑((/ul))bound while simultaneously remaining an undying attraction. In this tragedy, there are many happy moments, but no happy end. ((ul))((hl))Death is always the foreclosure of possibilities((/hl))((/ul)), and it comes eventually in its own time((ul)),((/ul)) even if not brought forward by the impatience of love. ((ul))((hl))The catch is to direct the affection to staving off the end((/hl))((/ul))((ul)),((/ul)) and to do this against the affection's nature. What follows is that, if moral relationship is grounded in the being-for togetherness (as it is), then it can exist as a project, and guide the self's conduct only as long as its nature of a project (a not yet-completed project) is not denied. ((ul))((hl))Morality, like the future itself, is forever not((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))‑((/hl))((/ul))yet((ul)).((/ul)) (And this is why the ethical code, any ethical code, the more so the more perfect it is by its own standards, supports morality the way the rope supports the hanged man.)

It is because of our loneliness (which is only belied, not overcome, by the hubbub of the being‑with) that we turn into moral selves.

On the continent, democratic and nationalist uprisings swept through France, Germany, and its neighbors, as reformists joined with middle- and working-class agitators to overturn monarchy and despotism. They won a few victories, but the reactionaries weren’t weak—in short order, forces led by Prussia and the Habsburgs in Vienna would crush the revolts and scatter these liberal movements to the winds. Meanwhile, in Ireland, a blight destroyed the potato crop and threatened millions with starvation, as British officials refused to help or intervene. Both events sparked mass migrations to the United States, as hundreds of thousands of Germans and Irish left their homes to escape political persecution, conflict, and famine. They followed a decade of similar but more modest immigration, stretching back to the 1830s, when the first major waves of German and Irish immigrants reached American shores. The Americans who met them were conflicted. On one hand, they believed in the Christian universalism, democratic equality, and its attendant faith in assimilation—the conviction, writes late historian John Higham in Strangers in the Land: Patterns of American Nativism, 1860–1925, “that this new land would bring unity out of diversity as a matter of course.” On the other, however, these migrants were alien, possessed of a religion—Catholicism—that seemed incompatible, if not hostile, to republican government. More than 3 million people came to American shores in the decade after 1845—the greatest increase in our history, relative to the overall population—and they exerted an immediate impact on American life and institutions, transforming cities across the Northeast and bringing a new wave of aggressive nativism, culminating in the anti-immigrant “Know-Nothing” movement, which spawned a political party. Its platform? “Repeal of all naturalization laws … War to the hilt, on political Romanism … Hostility to all Papal influences, when brought to bear against the Republic … The sending back of all foreign paupers.” The Know-Nothings burned hot—affiliated candidates swept several state legislatures in the 1854 elections—and quickly died out. By the end of the decade, sectional conflict over slavery had overcome immigration as the central issue of American politics. In the South, the Know-Nothing “American Party” dissolved in the face of Democratic dominance, and in the North, anti-slavery Know-Nothings were pulled into the nascent Republican Party. Despite the end of the Know-Nothings, ((ul))((hl))nativism persisted in national life, as part of the deep ambivalence and fear Americans have felt towards migrants, immigrants, and refugees of various stripes.((/hl))((/ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((ul))((hl))You saw it in violent form((/hl))((/ul)), for example, ((ul))during the waves of Chinese immigration((/ul)) in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when Chinese immigrants faced exclusion, discrimination, and outright pogroms from mobs of angry, resentful European Americans (some, no doubt, descended from Irish and German immigrants). You saw it ((ul))((hl))in the late 1930s, when Americans faced Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany((/hl))((/ul)), and had to choose: Would we take the victims of Hitler’s anti-Semitism, or reject them? On the question of refugee children, at least, Americans said no: 67 percent opposed taking in 10,000 refugee children from Germany, according to a 1939 poll from Gallup. They were similarly unmoved by earlier groups of Jewish refugees, and their fears evoked the anxieties of their predecessors in 1848 and beyond. Americans, and their counterparts in Western Europe, feared foreign influence and dangerous ideologies like communism and anarchism. (Just a few decades earlier, in the living memory of many adults at the time, an anarchist killed an American president.) Again and again, ((ul))when faced with the question of refugees and immigrants, Americans are ambivalent and sometimes hostile.((/ul)) In 1975, for example, 62 percent said they feared Vietnamese refugees would take their jobs. Four years later, just as many said they didn’t want to admit “boat people” from Vietnam, who were fleeing the country’s repressive communist government. Americans said the same for Cuban refugees in the 1980s, Haitians in the 1990s, and most recently, the wave of refugee children from South America, which brought protests and fears of disease and infection. You can even apply this dynamic to the Great Migration, the huge movement of black Americans from the South to cities and towns across the country. These Americans were internal refugees, fleeing lawlessness and racist terrorism. When they reached their destinations—cities like Detroit and Chicago—they faced deep hostility from existing residents, who blamed them for crime and economic disadvantage. The broad point—((ul))the reason to focus on the these patterns of hostility—is to emphasize the extent to which they are part of the American tradition.((/ul)) In calling for acceptance of Syrian refugees, President Obama, Sen.

Their medical needs must be addressed, and both children and adults have to be educated in preparation for entry into local labor markets. Before they are ready to work, financial support is also necessary. The ensuing boost to government spending and fiscal transfers will give domestic demand a shot in the arm. According to estimates from the IMF, by the end of 2017 GDP in Austria, Germany and Sweden—three countries which have received large numbers of refugees per capita—will have been boosted by 0.5%, 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively. In Germany, by far the largest recipient in absolute terms, refugee-related expenditure amounted to more than EUR 20 billion last year. In the longer term, the picture becomes far murkier. This isn’t just because little is known about the current cohort of refugees, such as their average level of education or how long they will remain in their host countries. It is also because ((ul))the long-term economic impact of refugees rests largely on how successful countries are at weaving them into the economic fabric of their societies.((/ul)) The more refugees who find jobs, and the better paid these jobs are, the greater the positive impact on labor supply, the public coffers and economic growth. ((ul))Upon arrival((/ul)), however, ((ul))asylum seekers face myriad problems which hinder their integration into the labor market.((/ul)) Many find that the ((ul))qualifications they held in their home countries are no longer recognized((/ul)), and even those who hold valid qualifications are ((ul))faced with a language barrier((/ul)); the vast majority of the refugees who have reached the European Union in the last few years lack basic competence in their host country’s language. ((ul))The process of applying for and being granted asylum is also a protracted one, often lasting around six months((/ul)). In some European nations, it is even longer, as ((ul))the sudden influx of refugees has led to a huge backlog of unprocessed claims.((/ul)) ((ul))((hl))In many countries, asylum seekers are not normally allowed to work while their claims are being processed, increasing the risks of demotivation and deskilling((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) Even ((ul))in Germany((/ul)), which is known for the efficiency of its bureaucracy and labor market, ((ul))only around 500,000 of the 1.2 million refugees had completed the first stages of the integration process and signed up as job seekers by March 2017. Of these refugees, a mere 12% had found employment((/ul)). If past experience is anything to go by, the full economic integration of refugees will prove an arduous task. ((ul))Studies from many developed countries have repeatedly shown that refugees tend to earn less, have worse employment prospects and hold lower occupational status than native workers or economic migrants.((/ul)) Even in Sweden, a country with a relatively strong track record of integrating refugees, a study of those arriving between 1997 and 2010 found that fewer than 20% had found employment after one year. Ten years down the line, only between 50% and 60% were working, significantly below the corresponding figure for Swedish natives. However, there is much that nations can do to help refugees integrate more seamlessly into society. For instance, Germany’s integration law, which was approved by its parliament in 2016, provides culture and languages classes for newcomers. This policy is similar to Sweden’s longer-standing introduction program, which includes an interview with the Public Employment Service (PES) in order to create a tailored action plan for each refugee, and provides personalized training, employment assistance, and financial and housing support. Special measures in the labor market could also be considered, in order to overcome any initial jitters employers may have about hiring refugees. Wage subsidies for firms who hire refugees have proven effective in several Nordic countries. The experience of refugees in the Netherlands has shown that work at temporary agencies can be another useful stepping stone, helping new arrivals adjust to labor market conditions. Enabling asylum seekers to hit the ground running and apply for jobs upon arrival, provided certain conditions are met, would also help; this is currently the case in Sweden, for example. ((ul))((hl))Policies which boost the labor market participation rate more generally will likely have an outsized effect on refugees. Improving the geographical mobility of migrants, making labor markets suppler and thus more adaptable to tumultuous technological change, and avoiding welfare traps due to an overlap between the benefit system and the tax system would all help refugees get their foot on the employment ladder.((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))"],"stats":{"highlightedWords":87}},{"tag":"((hl))Influx of refugees creates a litany of constraints and issues for host countries ((/hl))","cite":"((hl))Shellito((/hl)) 20((hl))16((/hl)) [Kevin Shellito, University of Pennsylvannia, 2016 \"The Economic Effect of Refugee Crises on Host Countries and Implications for the Lebanese Case,\" Joseph Wharton Scholars, https:// repository .upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&context=joseph_wharton_scholars // wyo-rrt]","text":["((ul))Refugee crises may also bring negative ((/ul))economic((ul)) consequences.((/ul)) Although this view is commonly heard in political punditry, existing academic literature has also identified many mechanisms in which these consequences occur, three of which are discussed below. ((ul))((hl))First, refugees can strain the services systems of host countries.((/hl))((/ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((ul))((hl))These strains occur in the task of processing and receiving refugees as well as integrating them into the host country. Examples of expenses include housing, healthcare, education, food, water, and utilities((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))(Aiyar et al. 2016). Understandably, the quality of a specific service may go down as it becomes strained to accommodate more people. ((ul))For example, in Turkey, increases in Syrian refugees have been associated with declines in quality of education and healthcare services((/ul)) (Goksel and Ozturkler 2015). Similarly, in Europe, the IMF estimates that refugees will cost EU countries nearly 0.1 percent of GDP on average (Aiyar et al. 2016). ((ul))The heavy amount of literature((/ul)) (on the 1990s Balkan crisis, for example) ((ul))that discusses “burden-sharing”—the cooperative process of one state taking responsibility for refugees that would usually fall under the purview of a different, but currently resource-strained,((/ul)) state—also suggests that this public service strain is a serious and relevant concern. (Suhrke 1998; Shimizu and Sandler 2002; Hartley and Sandler 1999; Barutciski and Suhrke 2001). Similarly, in today’s crisis, those countries facing the largest strain 17 from refugees (for example, Turkey, Jordan, and Lebanon) have called upon the international community for more support and diffusion of financial responsibility (Lowe 2016; “In Jordan…” 2015). And while this paper earlier highlighted that some public expenditures may strengthen the long-term infrastructure of a country, this does not come without the short-term cost, namely increased taxation to pay for the project as well as the opportunity cost of foregoing other potential investment opportunities (Zetter 2012). ((ul))((hl))Second((/hl))((/ul))((ul)),((/ul)) and related to strained services, ((ul))((hl))is the issue of overcrowding in the host nation((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) When hundreds of thousands of refugees arrive in a concentrated area, disease can quickly break out (Caldwell 2015). ((ul))The UN has reported that overcrowding has turned refugee camps((/ul))—in South Sudan, for example—((ul))from a welcoming refuge to a squalid encampment teeming with outbreaks of Hepatitis, cholera, malaria, and jaundice((/ul)) (Sinha 2012). ((ul))This has((/ul)) immediate negative economic effects, but can also have ((ul))long-term((/ul)) economic ((ul))effects by negatively impacting maternal and early childhood health((/ul)) (Baez 2011). In line with this idea of a lack of physical space, ((ul))refugees may also crowd out natives in local economic markets—from food to housing—and distort prices((/ul)) (Hatton and Williamson 2003). Turkey, for example, has seen dramatic increases in rental prices for housing as a result of the refugee crisis (Orhan and Gundogar 2015). ((ul))In some cases, unscrupulous—but opportunistic—landlords have kicked out lower income Turkish tenants in favor of Syrians, many of which may have a higher willingness and capacity to pay (((/ul))Orhan and Gundogar 2015). Additionally, while the aforementioned study of refugees from Rwanda and Burundi in Tanzania showed that an increase in food prices benefitted local producers, it ((ul))hurt local net-consumers of food, often requiring them to rely heavily on food aid from organizations such as the UN World Food Programme((/ul)) (Alix-Garcia & Saah 2010). 18 Further, overcrowding can lead to environmental degradation, which has become a serious concern in areas faced with a large influx of refugees((ul)). ((/ul))((ul))((hl))The UNHCR concedes that refugee-affected areas may face increased issues of “deforestation, soil erosion, pollution, and depletion of water resources”((/hl))((/ul)) (“Refugees and the Environment” 2001). Jayna Smith notes that these environmental consequences also have spillover effects, stating that “In a refugee situation, excessive damage to the environment not only causes deterioration of refugees' welfare but also leads to competition with local communities over scarce resources” (Smith). ((ul))This idea of competition can lead to a toxic “us against them” mentality, which is the kind of social strife((/ul)) that the next paragraph of this paper seeks to address. ((ul))A third concerning implication for refugee crises is((/ul)) the disruptive negative economic impact ((ul))that can emerge as a result of societal strife and potential civil conflict((/ul))((ul)). On a broader level, refugees may increase the potential for internal conflict and war in the host nation((/ul)) (Salehyan and Gleditsch 2006). For example, in the Horn of Africa, famine-driven refugee crises have often led to conflicting tribal and ethnic groups confined to a small geographic area (Salehyan 2008; Bakewell 2007; De Largy 1990). ((ul))On a smaller scale than all-out war, refugees can create social tensions, especially in cases where the refugees have distinct religious, political, or ethnic identities from the citizens of the host country ((/ul))(Tornkvsit 2015). This has been seen most recently in Sweden—a fairly homogeneous nation—through the torching of refugee shelters (Traub 2016). Aside from the refugee-native dynamic, ((ul))societal strife grow between factions of the native population over how to deal with the refugees.((/ul)) ((ul))This can most recently be seen in the case of the European Union, where countries like Sweden and Germany have adhered to more of an open door policy((/ul)), while some, like Hungary, have completely closed off their borders (Traub 19 2016). This has resulted in a lack of burden-sharing that has frustrated the more open countries. In the process, these countries have violated the multilateral Schengen Agreement for a “borderless” Europe, potentially undermining the very credibility of the European Union as a unified institution (Traub 2016). As a perennially divisive issue, refugee crises are liable to cause this kind of social strife no matter where they occur((ul)). Even in countries where the refugees have roughly similar ((/ul))(vis-à-vis the above Sweden example) ((ul))identities to the citizens of the host country, resentment, and sometimes even violence, may still surface among the natives.((/ul)) For example, Peshawar, a Pakistani city located near the border with Afghanistan, is home to thousands of Afghan refugees. Fleeing the Soviets, the Taliban, and the American war, these refugees have settled in nearby Pakistan. However, ((ul))((hl))despite the close geographic proximity, shared languages, and similar religious backgrounds, Afghan refugees have been subject to police brutality, discrimination, and lack of access to basic medical resources. They’ve also faced backlash and blame for Taliban attacks((/hl))((/ul)), such as the 2014 shooting at a Peshawar school that killed over 130 schoolchildren (Abid 2015; Saifi and Botehlo 2014). This potential for—and realization of—conflict and hostility can destabilize a host country and prevent meaningful economic development from gaining any traction: the World Bank estimates that any kind of extended civil conflict can deprive a developing country of up to the equivalent of 30 years of GDP growth (World Development Report 2011)"],"stats":{"highlightedWords":108}},{"tag":"((hl))Refugee’s bear a large cost on U.S. tax payers – status squo humanitarian aid is a better option and helps more than just a few((/hl)) ","cite":"((hl))Krikorian((/hl)) 20((hl))15((/hl)) [Mark Krikorian is a nationally recognized expert on immigration issues and has served as the Executive Director of the Center for Immigration Studies since 1995, 11-18-2015, “The Syrian Refugee Crisis and Its Impact on the Security of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program”, Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), https://cis.org/Testimony/Syrian-Refugee-Crisis-and-Its-Impact-Security-US-Refugee-Admissions-Program // wyo-rrt]","text":["In addition to the security threats that refugee resettlement poses, any effort to extend humanitarian assistance to refugees must consider how effective it will be. This question also has two facets. A) More can be helped abroad. Bringing refugees into our country makes us feel good about ourselves. Newspapers run heart-warming stories of overcoming adversity; churches embrace the objects of their charity; politicians wax nostalgic about their grandparents. But ((ul))the goal of refugee assistance is((/ul)) not to make us feel good. It is ((ul))to assist as many people as possible with the resources available.((/ul)) And resettling a relative handful of them here to help us bask in our own righteousness means we are sacrificing the much larger number who could have been helped with the same resources. ((ul))The difference in cost is enormous.((/ul)) ((ul))((hl))The Center for Immigration Studies has calculated that it ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))costs 12 times as much to resettle a refugee in the United States((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) as it does to care for the same refugee in the neighboring countries of first asylum, namely Turkey, Jordan, and Lebanon((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).((/hl))11 ((ul))The five-year cost to American taxpayers of resettling a single Middle Eastern refugee in the United States is conservatively estimated to be more than $64,000, compared with U.N. figures that indicate it costs about $5,300 to provide for that same refugee for five years in his native region.((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))In other words, each refugee we bring to the United States means that 11 others are not being helped with that money. ((/ul))Faced with 12 drowning people, only a monster would send them a luxurious one-man boat rather than 12 life jackets. And yet, with the best of intentions, that is exactly what we are doing when we choose one lucky winner to resettle here. ((ul))Some will object that we can do both – relocate some refugees here and care for others in their native region. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))But money is not infinite((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) Every dollar the government spends is borrowed and will have to be paid back by our grandchildren. What's more, the U.N. estimates that there are 60 million refugees and internally displaced people around the world. Clearly, whatever amount we allocate to refugee protection will provide for only a fraction of the people in need. ((ul))Given these limitations on resources((/ul)), I submit that it is wrong — morally wrong — to use those resources to resettle one refugee here when we could help 12 closer to their home. There is little we can do to minimize the costs of resettling refugees. True, the private contractors the State Department pays to oversee the process are making a good living off of refugee resettlement, but reining them in won't make much difference. ((ul))((hl))Most of the costs come from social service((/hl))((/ul))((ul))s; according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, more than 90 percent of refugees from the Middle East receive food stamps and nearly three-quarters are on Medicaid or some other taxpayer-funded health care.((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))This dependence on taxpayer handouts should come as no surprise. Refugees arrive destitute and often traumatized. They have little education (those from the Middle East have an average of only 10.5 years of schooling), which means that even if they find work, it will pay little. And because they're poor – almost all have incomes only slightly above the poverty line – they pay little in taxes. Of course, we don't resettle refugees for economic reasons but for humanitarian ones. And since the goal is humanitarian, a wise steward must use his resources so that they generate the greatest humanitarian return. It's also true that refugees brought here will live better than those even in well-run refugee camps in the region.

However, the total number of deportations has not increased as much. In fact, ((ul))((hl))the total number of pending cases in immigration courts nationwide has increased steadily((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) since 2006((/ul)), in a judicial backlog that immigration advocates and enforcement hawks alike agree is an inefficient system. In November 2017, the backlog ticked up to 650,411 pending immigration cases, a number which has increased nearly 25 percent in this fiscal year alone, and tripled since former President Barack Obama took office in 2009. As a result, the average number of days a case must currently wait to be heard is 691 days, although in several states such as Colorado and Illinois the waiting period to receive a final ruling is closer to 3 years. At this rate, the average immigration judge has a caseload of about 1,900 cases per year. For comparison, the average caseload of district court judges is around 440 cases per year. Although ((ul))the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Department of Justice has increased its hiring((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) this year, growing the corps of immigration judges to approximately 330, officials have indicated that it would take nearly 700 total judges before witnessing a significant shift in the number of pending cases. In ((/ul))((ul))((hl))demonstrating its efforts to “slash the backlog((/hl))((/ul))((ul)),” the DOJ has cited ((/ul))((ul))((hl))a 16 percent increase in efficiency((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) of final decisions since FY2016. In a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee, Attorney General Jeff Sessions claimed that in the last 2 or 3 months, DOJ has “almost” not added to the immigration court backlog, and that by January 2018 the department will be reducing the backlog. ((/ul))Despite these advances, to effectively reduce and manage its pending cases, the immigration court system must undergo much greater reform than simply hiring additional immigration judges. ((ul))((hl))To address this((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))crippling ((/ul))((ul))((hl))backlog, DOJ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))’s Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))has outlined a series of initiatives((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) for FY2018.((/ul)) ((ul))These include initial pilot testing of the long-awaited electronic filing and adjudicating system, expanding the efforts of the Fraud and Abuse Prevention Program under a new fraud attorney and investigator to eliminate frivolous and fraudulent cases, hiring additional field supervisors to improve oversight and communication, establishing an EOIR Office of Policy, and introducing a streamlined hiring process which is expected to bring in 61 new immigration judges in early 2018. The Trump administration has also proposed establishing performance metrics and numerical quotas for immigration judges as part of its larger immigration reforms. ((/ul))Despite backlash from both the advocacy community and the National Association of Immigration Judges claiming that these proposals threaten judicial independence, EOIR has not commented on reports that they would be imposing case-completion quotas on judges. In a November 2017 congressional hearing before the House Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security, Acting EOIR Director James McHenry did not reject claims that the EOIR would be using numerical and time-based quotas to assess immigration judges’ performance. Democratic members of the subcommittee pressed McHenry on the controversial nature of these completion quotas, arguing they would further exacerbate the challenges judges face in deciding more difficult cases. McHenry defended EOIR’s right to do so by referring to the quotas set by the Immigration Nationality Act as well as standards set by the Government Performance and Results Act in assessing the efficient completion of court rulings. He also affirmed that EOIR was “looking into” implementing numerical metrics for individual judges’ performance with unions like the National Association of Immigration Judges. In the weeks after the subcommittee hearing, Sessions issued a memo publicly affirming the DOJ’s emphasis on increased productivity. The memo criticized unnecessary delays in case rulings, and encouraged EOIR personnel to prioritize “timely and efficient adjudication of immigration cases.”"],"stats":{"highlightedWords":44}},{"tag":"Increasing asylum applications overwhelm immigration courts, creates massive backlog.","cite":"Andrew Becker / June 4, 2017 Reveal “Nearly 600,000 immigration cases clog courts, study finds” https://www.revealnews.org/blog/nearly-600000-immigration-cases-clog-courts-study-finds/ Becker's reporting has appeared in The Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, Newsweek/The Daily Beast and on National Public Radio and PBS/FRONTLINE, among others.

(JM)","text":["Racked with a backlog approaching 600,000 cases, the nation’s 58 immigration courts over the last decade have taken longer to rule on deportations, asylum claims and other matters despite hiring more judges and more than doubling their annual budget, according to a new Government Accountability Office report((ul)). ((/ul))Government auditors said that the Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review, which oversees the immigration court system, has been plagued by inefficiencies((ul)),((/ul)) its own foot-dragging in hiring new judges and an increasingly complex and changing legal landscape spurred by recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions and lawsuits brought by immigrants facing deportation. ((ul))((hl))Between 2006 and 2015 the court system’s caseload more than doubled((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), growing steadily each year under the Obama administration, while judges completed nearly one-third fewer cases, the report states((/ul)). The study was conducted at the request of congressional Republicans and Democrats. That spells bad news for President Donald Trump as he pushes his central political agenda to crack down on illegal immigration and beef up border security. The report underscores that ((ul))((hl))the already bogged-down immigration courts could become a major obstacle((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) to his objective of removing 2 million to 3 million people from the country((/ul)). But the good news for immigrants is that ((ul))judges are ordering deportation for a smaller percentage of immigrants, down to 52 percent in 2015 compared to 77 percent((/ul)) in 2006. Judges are also more frequently ending cases, or ruling in an immigrant’s favor. Overall, judges now decide fewer cases based on the actual merits of arguments than they did a decade ago. ((ul))Despite smaller individual caseloads for judges, immigration hearings are being scheduled years into the future((/ul)), including five years out in at least one court, according to the report. Such ((ul))((hl))delays a((/hl))((/ul))((ul))lso ((/ul))((ul))((hl))put a strain on immigrants’ legal rights by making it more difficult to produce witnesses or documents in their defense,((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) potentially jeopardizing their legitimate claims to avoid deportation. Sometimes people who may have had a good claim against deportation lost their eligibility over time because their circumstances changed((/ul)), the report states. In other instances, immigrants who don’t have a solid argument to stay in the country avoid deportation longer because their hearings are delayed. “The effects of the case backlog are significant and wide-ranging, from ((ul))some respondents waiting years to have their cases heard to immigration judges being able to spend less time considering cases((/ul)),” the report concludes, adding that technology could help the court tackle the backlog. A surge of unaccompanied children arriving at the border starting in 2014 has also exacerbated the challenges faced by immigration judges. Those cases, which usually take longer because of different legal options, are given priority over matters that may be resolved faster. The median number of days to complete a deportation case, accounting for nearly all of the court system’s caseload between 2006 and 2015, grew 700 percent from 42 days to 336 days. Auditors concluded that those ((ul))((hl))delays are also due to judges delaying decisions more by continuing cases((/hl))((/ul)). Continuances are grouped into about 70 different categories, including more time needed because of illness of an immigrant, their witness or attorney, delays in background investigations or security checks, and insufficient time to complete a hearing. While apprehensions of border jumpers have ebbed to their lowest point in decades, ((ul))immigration enforcement jumped 37.6 percent in the first 100 days of the Trump administration compared to the same time period a year befor((/ul))e, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ((ul))Deportations, however, were down about 12 percent. Although the Trump administration has called for hiring dozens of additional judges, the mounting caseload could be further intensified by a wave of judges retiring. Almost 40 percent of immigration judges are now eligible for retirement. The office’s budget is about $440 million for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, up from $199 million in 2005((/ul)). The study also explored the question of whether an independent immigration court could better handle deportation cases, appeals, immigration-related discrimination complaints and other matters than the current system run by the Justice Department. The association that represents immigration judges for years has advocated for such independence, but has not persuaded a federal judicial panel to make the change. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who earlier this year directed prosecutors to prioritize immigration offenses for prosecution, announced recently the appointment of an acting director to take over the 1,000-person immigration office. James McHenry, who had served as deputy associate attorney general with a focus on immigration litigation, replaces Juan Osuna, who ran the office for much of the Obama administration."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":55}},{"tag":"Clogged courts forces waiting immigrants into detention centers indefinitely, regardless of their innocence/legitimacy","cite":" Jonathan Blitzer June 20, 2017 The New Yorker, “What Will Trump Do with Half a Million Backlogged Immigration Cases?” https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-will-trump-do-with-half-a-million-backlogged-immigration-cases Jonathan Blitzer is a staff writer at The New Yorker.

((ul))U.S. immigration courts are facing a backlog of over half a million cases—and each one, on average, takes almost two years to close. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))These delays mean that everyone((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) from asylum seekers to green-card holders ((/ul))((ul))((hl))faces extended stays in detention((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) while awaiting rulings. Speaking about the problem, one immigration judge recently told the Times, “((/ul))((ul))((hl))The courts as a whole lose credibility.”((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))Much of the backlog can be traced back to the Obama Administration, when spending on immigration enforcement went up, while Congress dramatically limited funds for hiring more judges. The number of pending cases grew from a hundred and sixty-seven thousand, in 2008, to five hundred and sixty thousand, in 2017, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse. The broader trend, though, goes back farther. Since the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, in 2002, ((ul))the increase in resources allocated for border security and immigration policing has always significantly outpaced funding for the courts((/ul)). (Immigration courts are part of the Department of Justice.) As more and more people have been arrested, detained, and ordered deported, the courts have remained understaffed and underfunded. “We’ve always been an afterthought,” Dana Leigh Marks, the president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, told me. Roughly three hundred judges nationwide are responsible for the entire immigration caseload, and hiring is slow—filling a vacancy typically takes about two years, according to the Government Accountability Office. In Nogales, Sessions said that he would try to streamline the hiring process. But until that happens the Administration has been relocating judges to areas where they’re deemed most necessary. “We have already surged twenty-five immigration judges to detention centers along the border,” Sessions said, as if talking about military troop levels. Since March, New York City, for example, has had at least eight of its twenty-nine immigration judges reassigned, at least temporarily, to Texas and Louisiana, WNYC has reported. But in relocating them ((ul))the federal government is exacerbating the city’s own significant backlog: roughly eighty thousand pending cases and an average delay of six hundred and twenty-five days per case. “((/ul))((ul))((hl))Letting political forces impact the courts’ docketing strategy disrupts our system((/hl))((/ul))((ul)),” Marks said. “The temporary assignments to the border courts have been extremely problematic. There’s no one to backfill those slots.”((/ul)) The situation reminded her of a move made by the Obama Administration in 2014, when tens of thousands of unaccompanied children showed up at the U.S. border seeking asylum. The Department of Justice sent immigration judges to the border states to handle the sudden spike in cases, leaving their home states in the lurch. “We cleared the desks,” Marks said. “We pushed back cases that were ready to be heard, and we heard cases that weren’t ready to be brought to completion. There’s only so fast you can go and still allow due process.” The Trump Administration’s significant enforcement push is putting another sudden strain on the system. So far this year, federal immigration authorities have made forty per cent more arrests than they did at an equivalent point in 2016, and ((ul))the Department of Homeland Security has eliminated all the guidelines for how Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ice) is supposed to prioritize the people it targets for arrest. “The largest federal law-enforcement agency in the country, which is seeking more funding and less accountability, is given carte blanche to go after who it wants((/ul)),” Avideh Moussavian, a lawyer at the National Immigration Law Center, said of ice and Customs and Border Protection. “It’s creating this ballooning problem of subjecting so many more people to detention, ((ul))with no interest from the federal government in providing resources to insure that they have fair proceedings.”((/ul)) Immigration proceedings are civil matters rather than criminal ones, so ((ul))the protections generally afforded to criminal defendants don’t apply to individuals with cases before immigration judges.((/ul)) If a defendant wins in a criminal case, the government can’t appeal. Nor can authorities hold a person in prison after an exonerating ruling. In immigration court, however, ((ul))ice can appeal if a judge decides to close a case, and often ((/ul))((ul))((hl))an individual will remain in detention while that process runs its course((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).((/hl)) The Supreme Court is currently weighing a case in which a large class of litigants are seeking mandatory bond hearings every six months for anyone in immigrant detention. As it stands now, ((ul))individuals are held indefinitely while they wait((/ul))((ul)) for a judge to rule on their situation, whether it’s an asylum claim or a contested deportation order. (Being detained doesn’t mean their cases are wea((/ul))k; according to Justice Department figures, roughly twenty per cent of all deportation cases resolved in 2016—some twenty thousand cases—ended in the immigrants’ favor, with the deportation orders being dropped.) ((ul))In immigration cases((/ul)), Anthony Enriquez, a lawyer with the Immigrant Defense Project, told me, ((ul))people “wear the same jumpsuits as criminal defendants. They’re put in the same cells. Still, they don’t have the same protections.”((/ul)) Earlier this month, in the Bronx, I met ((ul))Christian Yarleque, a forty-seven-year-old lawful permanent resident who came to the U.S. from Peru three decades ago, when he was fourteen. In 2008, he was arrested for drug possession, a misdemeanor((/ul)), and he served six months in jail. One morning, seven years after his release, ((ul))ice agents showed up at his apartment, in the Bronx, with a deportation order.((/ul)) He let the agents inside because they told him they were with the police. “They deceived me,” he said. When they arrested him, he told them that he’d already served his time. “Not with us,” they responded. (An ice spokesperson told me, “ice deportation officers will identify themselves appropriately on each arrest.”) ((ul))After three and a half months in detention, an immigration judge heard the case and decided to close it, effectively quashing ice’s order of deportation. ice decided to mount an appeal. Because of the court backlog, it took more than a year before another judge ruled on the appeal, and though the judge set bond, it was well beyond what Yarleque could afford to pay. During that time, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Yarleque((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))remained in a detention center((/ul)), in Newark, while his family struggled—he had been the family’s primary breadwinner. Each week, his wife came to visit him, bringing him money for food and phone time, so that he could speak to his kids regularly. On Tuesdays, ice officers came to meet with inmates who were considering accepting a deportation order just to escape detention. “I thought about throwing in the towel at one point,” he said. “I had no idea when I’d be able to get out.” Yarleque was comparatively fortunate: through a program called the New York Immigrant Family Unity Project, ((ul))((hl))he had a lawyer.

He was released, and is now back in the Bronx with his family; soon he’ll begin a new job, as a janitor at a local hospital. He can start work just as soon as D.H.S. returns his green card. When I asked him when that would be, he turned to his lawyer, who had joined us for the conversation. “It’s hard to know,” he said. “((ul))((hl))There are bureaucratic delays.”((/hl))((/ul))"],"stats":{"highlightedWords":57}},{"tag":"Privately run, for-profit detention centers present deplorable conditions for immigrants awaiting trial by utilizing opaque fraudulent contracts issued by ICE – turns case","cite":"Robin Urevich June 28, 2018 Capital and Main, “The Rise and Fall of an Immigration Detention Empire” https://capitalandmain.com/the-rise-and-fall-of-an-immigration-detention-empire-0628 Robin Urevich is a journalist and radio reporter whose work has appeared on NPR, Marketplace, the San Francisco Chronicle and the Las Vegas Sun. (JM)","text":["((ul))In 2016 two immigrant detainees died after receiving care at facilities run by Emerald Correctional Management, a small Louisiana-based for-profit prison firm that at the time managed detention centers for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ((/ul))A Russian asylum seeker, 46-year old Igor Zyazin, died of a heart attack several days after medical staff at Emerald’s San Luis Regional Detention Facility near Yuma, Arizona failed to adequately treat his severe chest pain. (See “Could an Undocumented Russian’s Life Have Been Saved?”) Olubunmi Joshua, 54, passed away after enduring eight months of medical errors and treatment delays at the Rolling Plains Detention Center in Haskell, Texas. (See “Anatomy of an ICE Death.”) Emerald operated three ICE detention centers and a county jail before going out of business in early 2017. A Capital & Main investigation has found ((ul))Emerald took in millions of government dollars as it skimped on essential expenses and damaged detainees, its own employees and, likely, taxpayers while ICE officials looked the other way. Like other for-profit prison companies, Emerald did business with ICE through secretive no-bid contracts using city governments as middlemen. Critics charge these contracts allow ICE to avoid legal responsibility—for deaths, injuries and sexual abuse that occur in detention—and play a role in the government’s see-no-evil approach to detention abuses. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Since 2003, ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))183 detainees have died in ICE custody((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)). The federal government depends on profit-driven prison companies,((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) including smaller firms like Emerald and corrections giants, such as CoreCivic and the Geo Group, to run its sprawling, 200-plus-prison detention network. At Emerald, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))chaos reigned in the form of wage theft, poor medical care and crowded, unsanitary conditions. But ICE officials didn’t intervene((/hl))((/ul)), and it’s rare that it does at other facilities with serious problems. Between 2010 and 2017, just two of more than 200 detention centers received failing or “deficient” ratings from ICE inspectors. The government’s failure to act against these facilities is partly the result of an insatiable hunger for lockups, said Mark Fleming, an attorney with the National Immigrant Justice Center. Fleming contended that without the capacity to warehouse thousands of immigrants in facilities run by private prison companies, the government would face “an existential crisis.” In a rush to create detention space, ICE has used opaque noncompetitive contracts called Intergovernmental Service Agreements to quickly bring beds online. Now, as ICE seeks to expand family detention, it is likely to turn to IGSAs just as it did in 2014, when a wave of Central American children and families sought asylum in the U.S. It is reportedly planning to house families at the Fort Bliss Army base in Texas. Critics argue that ((ul))the sole purpose of some of these agreements is to avoid public protest and federal contracting rules that officially are aimed at ensuring transparency and avoiding overpayment by the government. ((/ul))Immigration detention has expanded fivefold in the past 23 years, and with the Trump administration’s deportation surge, is growing larger. But when Emerald got its start in 1997, the immigration detention system was just ramping up, and immigration detention contracts were a reliable source of business for the company – even as Emerald’s blunders were getting it ousted from county jails and knocked out of the running for state and local bids to operate jails and prisons nationwide. The company drummed up some of its business by convincing small towns that jails and prisons would revive their dying economies. In the 1980s and ’90s, Raywood J. LeMaire, one of the company’s four partners, learned firsthand as the five-term Vermilion Parish sheriff that ((ul))there was money to be made in renting out jail beds to relieve state-prison overcrowding((/ul)). Louisiana sheriffs like LeMaire generated money and power for their offices by housing state prisoners in their jails—often on the cheap and in poor conditions. “As long as you didn’t feed them too well – grits and beans and cold bologna — you could make some money,” alleged Keith Nordyke, a Louisiana attorney who has long represented prisoners. Asked about his partnership in Emerald, LeMaire, now in his late 70s, told Capital & Main, “I got out of it in January,” before refusing to talk further and hanging up the phone. Emerald’s other partners, Glenn Hebert, who also once worked for the Vermilion Parish Sheriff’s Office, Clay Lee, W.T. Lee and former CEO Steve Afeman couldn’t be reached for comment. Hull Youngblood, an attorney who represented the company, didn’t return calls or answer emails. Red flags had warned of trouble inside the company at least since 2003, when Emerald took over operations at the Rolling Plains Detention Center from another private firm. “We saw things go to hell,” said Judy Morrell, who worked as a guard at Rolling Plains. Food for detainees was scarce, she alleged: “They would feed these people chicken bones and rice. If you don’t feed them, they’ve got to get money to buy [from] the commissary.” Morrell noted that Emerald profited from its in-prison store. “But you take people who didn’t have money, by God, they didn’t eat. They’d get to stealing and thieving.” Now 70, Morrell said that when she started with Emerald she knew how prisons were supposed to run, having put in five years with the Texas prison system. Morrell publicly complained about bad food and overcrowding, and quit her job in 2004. Federal officials were quoted in local media at the time as pledging to investigate her accusations. Three years later, a habeas corpus petition filed on behalf of five members of a Palestinian family alleged they were the victims of sexual harassment, inadequate medical treatment, excessive use of solitary confinement and religious intolerance. Over the years at Rolling Plains, Texas Commission on Jail Standards ((ul))((hl))inspectors found repeated incidents of overcrowding, unsafe and unsanitary conditions, failure of medical staff to follow doctors’ orders, understaffing and failure of staff to perform regular checks on detainees((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).((/hl)) (ICE inspectors became more critical of the facility only in its later years, noting dozens of violations of its standards but, based on available inspection reports, never appears to have given Rolling Plains an overall deficient rating.) Cases of egregious neglect by Emerald have included: — The 2016 suicide of a 77-year-old county inmate, Kennie Moore, who hanged himself using his boxer shorts as a noose. — Emerald’s 2012 ousting, by a Louisiana sheriff, from the Riverbend Detention Center when his officers discovered a mother lode of drugs, cellphones and shanks during a shakedown. — A lawsuit filed by workers at the West Texas Detention Facility against Emerald that alleged they were forced to work off the clock and weren’t paid for overtime; it was eventually settled out of court. By 2016 the company had abandoned or been fired from more detention contracts than it maintained. As early as 2005, local and state governments in Florida, Vermont and Texas began to turn down the company’s bids to house prisoners or build facilities, citing its record. What’s more, the prison building boom was winding down as states tried to reduce their prison populations. But ICE was Emerald’s ace in the hole. In 2016, Emerald finished construction on the $60 million Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, Texas and began managing the 700-bed facility for the agency. Prairieland replaced Rolling Plains, whose location was too remote for adequate staffing and transportation of detainees, said one former ICE official. ((ul))Perhaps ICE could overlook the company’s checkered history because technically the federal agency wasn’t in business with Emerald((/ul)). Emerald’s contract was not with the government, but rather with Alvarado, a town of 4,000 near Fort Worth, which has no actual role in running the detention center. ICE spokesman Carl Rusnok didn’t address Capital & Main’s questions about whether it reviewed Emerald’s record before approving it as the operator of the Prairieland facility. He wrote in an email that new facilities contracts must meet the latest ICE standards, which require that all facilities “vigorously investigate all claims of abuse, and mistreatment of detainees by staff and other detainees.” Like all Intergovernmental Service Agreements, ((ul))the deal was made without the transparency that federal contracting rules dictate((/ul)). ICE signed the agreement with Alvarado city officials, but city officials have no role in operating Prairieland. “If you told me today that I’d have to start running the jail tomorrow, that wouldn’t work,” said Rick Holden, Alvarado’s city manager. “We’re not set up for that.” Holden is new on the job, having arrived in early May. Still, he said that after six weeks in office he hadn’t visited Prairieland. “We don’t manage it from here. Nobody out there reports to me,” Holden said. “ICE is the agency that has the facility.” If Holden would find it daunting to manage a detention center in his backyard, imagine the task that would face city officials in Eloy, Arizona. On paper, Eloy manages the 2,400-bed South Texas Family Residential Center, which is located more than 900 miles away in Dilley, Texas. But last February, the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general found that Eloy doesn’t actually run the detention center, and didn’t even negotiate the agreement with ICE. Private prison operator CoreCivic did. CoreCivic appears to have engineered the whole deal by asking the Eloy City Council to modify an existing ICE contract to also include the South Texas facility. The town of Eloy was simply a middleman that was paid more than $400,000 annually by CoreCivic for the job, the inspector general concluded. The IG noted that a lack of accountability is built into this particular contracting arrangement: “Because ICE’s agreement and legal relationship is with the city of Eloy, CCA’s [Core Civic’s] performance is effectively insulated from government scrutiny.” The absurdity of a small city like Eloy overseeing a massive detention center in another state may be apparent, but the basics of its contract don’t differ much from a number of other IGSAs between ICE and local governments: Cities are routinely paid fees to act as middlemen between ICE and private companies. Still, for the most part, the inspector general’s office limited its criticism to the Eloy agreement. But it did express its disapproval of ICE’s handling of IGSAs in general. “((ul))ICE has no assurance that it executed detention center contracts in the best interest of the Federal Government, taxpayers, or detainees((/ul)),” the report observed. Eloy isn’t the only city supposedly overseeing detention operations from afar. In California, the city of Adelanto, in San Bernardino county, signed a 2014 agreement to provide guard services for a family detention center in New Mexico for a year. The services were provided by the for-profit prison firm, the GEO Group, not the city of Adelanto. The small San Joaquin Valley town of McFarland has a long-standing IGSA with ICE to operate the Mesa Verde Detention Center in Bakersfield, nearly 30 miles away. The legitimate purpose of IGSAs is to allow government agencies to fill urgent needs by piggybacking onto services a local government already offers. In many cases, ICE does exactly that by signing an agreement with a local sheriff to rent beds in a county jail. However, in other cases, ICE has used IGSAs only to rapidly bring detention facilities online by skirting federal contracting rules, which require an open bidding process that ensures transparency and competition. ((ul))((hl))About a third of all immigrant detainees are housed under these sort of agreements between ICE and cities((/hl))((/ul)). Attorney Mark Fleming believes these are sham contracts, especially in cases where the city doesn’t even own the facility, much less operates it. “((ul))These are fraudulent contracts to allow ICE to float money to a private company to avoid federal procurement laws((/ul)),” Fleming said. “That’s a fraudulent contract because the locality has nothing to offer.” For example, the Adelanto Detention Center in San Bernardino County is operated under an IGSA between the city of Adelanto and ICE. The city, however, doesn’t run the detention center. The for-profit GEO Group does."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":84}},{"tag":"Backlog stabilizing now ","cite":"Sacchetti 17","text":["11-3-17 Maria Sacchetti covers immigration for The Washington Post.

((/ul))Officials, who briefed reporters on condition that they not be identified by name, said ((ul))the effort is part of the Trump administration's broad plan to more efficiently handle cases of undocumented immigrants((/ul)), who number 11 million nationwide. The administration has reversed Obama-era policies that allowed prosecutors to indefinitely postpone low-priority cases, which the Justice Department officials said allowed some immigrants to delay \"inevitable\" deportations. In other cases, they said, immigrants who deserved to win their cases were delayed for years because of the backlog((ul)). The immigration court backlog has tripled since 2009,((/ul)) the year former president Obama took office, to more than 630,000 cases in October. \"((ul))That is what this administration is committed to, getting this done right, ensuring that we're never in this place again((/ul)),\" a Justice Department official said. \"Really and truly, when you look at the numbers . . . it reflects the fact that the last administration likely wasn't as committed to ensuring that the system worked the way that Congress intended it to.\" ((ul))The agency, which oversees the administrative immigration courts, said it plans to hire new immigration judges, use technology such as videoconferencing, and increase judges' productivity by setting case-completion guidelines((/ul)), though officials would not give details.

((ul))The Justice Department ((/ul))((ul))((hl))is tapping retired judges to fill((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) those ((/ul))((ul))((hl))courts((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). ((/ul))The immigration court overhaul comes as the Trump administration is carrying out policies that could generate even more cases in coming months. Arrests and deportations from the interior of the United States are rising sharply, and the Trump administration has ended Obama-era protections for some undocumented immigrants, including 690,000 undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United States as children. By Monday, the Trump administration is also expected to say if it will renew temporary protected status for thousands of longtime immigrants from Honduras and Nicaragua whose permits expire next year. The Justice Department officials said they are no longer widely using certain protections for undocumented immigrants, including a tool known as prosecutorial discretion that allowed the government to set aside low-priority deportation cases. DOJ officials criticized immigration lawyers, saying they \"have purposely used tactics designed to delay\" immigration cases. As of 2012, the officials said, there were an average of four continuances for each case before the court. Gregory Chen, director of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said the administration's plan to cut the backlog would \"undermine judicial independence\" in the immigration courts. \"This administration has been extremely hostile toward the judiciary and the independence of immigration judges, as well as other judges,\" Chen said. Speeding up cases depends partly on congressional funding. It also rests partly on the actions of immigration judges, who have expressed concerns about due process for immigrants, many of whom are facing deportation to some of the world's most violent countries. Immigrants are not entitled to a government-appointed lawyer in these courts and often handle cases on their own. The Justice officials would not comment on reports that they will impose case-completion quotas on judges, which raised an outcry from the judges' union. But the officials said they would give judges clear standards to complete cases and add more supervisors. ((ul))((hl))Officials((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) say they are ((/ul))((ul))((hl))already seeing results from efforts this year to improve efficiency((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).

U.S. border officials are trying to work through the backlog, but they can go only as fast as migrants can be processed and moved from temporary holding cells to immigration detention. ((/ul))An official with U.S. Customs and Border Protection said the agency remains committed to meeting the care and safety needs of people in custody, and is working actively with partners, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to resolve the backup. “There are potentially a number of reasons causing the San Diego area ports of entry to reach capacity; we do not have a definitive reason to offer at this time,” the official added. ((ul))Because of the backlog, close to 100 migrants lined up((/ul)) last week in the plaza outside the walkway that leads to PedWest, the pedestrian border crossing that opened earlier this year, Tijuana media outlets reported. ((ul))Migrants slept in line, afraid of losing their places and having to wait longer for CBP to process them((/ul)). Then, Mexican officials told them they couldn’t stay in the plaza. On Monday of last week, about 25 migrants were jailed overnight for waiting in the plaza outside the port, according to several Eritrean migrants. In the days since, some found refuge in Tijuana’s migrant shelters, particularly the Casa del Migrante. Each morning, they return to the port to ask if there is room in CBP’s processing area. When they’re turned away, they walk over to a nearby plaza and wait until shelters open for the night. “We can’t give up. We don’t have option,” said Mesfin Tesfaldet, a 33-year-old man from Eritrea seeking asylum in the U.S., who has been waiting to be processed for at least a week. He was again shooed out of El Chaparral plaza on Friday along with about a dozen others from Eritrea and Cameroon. ((ul))When someone arrives at a port without documents for entry, CBP officials interview that person, take photographs and fingerprints and check law enforcement databases for records. If that person reports being afraid to go back to his or her home country, CBP is required by law to transfer that migrant to other federal agencies for a potential asylum case. Most of the asylum process happens once the person has been transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement — or ICE — custody, and back-ups in that transfer system can leave CBP with limited space in its temporary holding cells at the border.

((/ul))In the fall of 2016, San Diego’s ports were overwhelmed by thousands of Haitian migrants. In partnership with Mexican officials, CBP established a ticketing system that scheduled appointments for migrants to be processed. As of November, the most recent data available from CBP, arrivals hadn’t reached the levels of the wave of arriving Haitians. In October 2016, ((ul))more than 6,000 people came to San Diego’s ports of entry asking to come in despite not having documents((/ul)) permitting entry to the U.S. ((ul))That number included asylum seekers — CBP does not distinguish between those seeking asylum and other “inadmissibles” in its data collection((/ul)). (In addition to asylum seekers, inadmissibles are those looking for better economic opportunities or anyone else who has asked to enter the U.S. at a port without the proper documents.) In November 2017, the number of people deemed inadmissible was 2,824, more than double the low of 1,313 reached in March of this year. Under current policy, ((ul))((hl))asylum seekers are ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))detained by ICE until they get results from credible fear interviews((/hl))((/ul)), which determine the likelihood that they will win their cases in immigration court.

Some((/hl)) are released from detention on parole or by paying bond while they wait for their turns to tell their stories to immigration judges. Asylum seekers, like refugees, must prove that they’ve been persecuted or fear persecution because of their race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group. Tesfaldet said he fled Eritrea to Sudan after he was jailed for his political views. In Sudan, he said, he couldn’t go to a refugee camp because the two governments were working together to send Eritreans back to their home country. He hid for several years before finding a way to fly to Brazil. From there, he followed a grueling and potentially fatal migrant trail up to Tijuana. “It was hard. It’s very bad, that jungle. Many people is dying, especially in the river,” Tesfaldet said. “We sacrificed ourselves already. We don’t expect to have a problem when we get here.” He saw children swept away by the water at river crossings — pulled right out of their mothers’ arms, he said. He left his 5-year-old daughter in hiding in Sudan while he made the journey because he didn’t want to risk losing her on the way. He hopes that if he is able to win his asylum case in the U.S., he’ll be able to bring her to join him. He thinks about his daughter every day, he said. He doesn’t care where he lives in the U.S. as long as he is allowed in. “I want safe. I want peaceful,” Tesfaldet said. Some of the migrants from African countries expressed frustration that they were the ones left outside after Mexican officials intervened. “We are human beings,” said one man from Eritrea. “They don’t respect. I’m feeling racism here, a big discrimination here. We don’t want to be here in Mexico. Our target, our way is USA.” When Tijuana media first reported the line of migrants, many of those interviewed were Mexican asylum seekers fleeing gang violence in other parts of the country. By Friday, most of them did not appear outside the port. An official from Mexico’s immigration agency told a Mexican media outlet that his agency had asked CBP to find a way to take in more people because of concerns about how migrant children waiting in line could be affected when temperatures drop overnight. The group of Eritreans and Cameroonians outside El Chaparral on Friday said many of those who didn’t make it into the U.S. had traveled on to Mexicali or even Texas to try at other ports.

The NTA is issued by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and USCIS. It must be served to the individual and presented to the immigration court for removal proceedings to be triggered. When someone receives an NTA, they must appear before an immigration judge at an assigned date and location to determine if they are eligible to remain in the country legally or should be removed. NTAs are traditionally issued under certain situations, such as terminations of conditional permanent residence, referrals of asylum cases, and positive credible fear findings. Beginning immediately, NTAs will also be issued by USCIS: For denials of an initial application or re-registration for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) or a withdrawal of TPS when the applicant has no other lawful immigration status. When fraud, misrepresentation, or evidence of abuse of public benefit programs is part of an individual’s record, even if the application or petition has been denied for other reasons.

Like more than half the people facing immigration charges, Rivas couldn’t afford an attorney. A friend accompanied him to court, where he said he was always confused. “I never really understood. ... The only reason I do now is because I have a lawyer,” he says. Rivas had a police report to prove he’d gone to authorities in Honduras. Doing that was risky in Honduras; Rivas says he's certain that's why he was targeted by his attackers.

Facing deportation, he saved up money to hire a lawyer to appeal.

The mostly first-time hearings last no more than three minutes each. Almost all are postponed — some for years. “Please state your name,” Judge Salinardi asks for the record. “Is Spanish your first language?” If so, he says, a translator will be provided. He verifies a few facts about the case. “Will you be available on August 18th of 2021?” ((ul))The immigration courts — there are more than 50 nationwide — have had big backlogs since well before Trump took office.

Right now, the backlog stands at 658,728. “This is a new era. This the era of Trump,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced last year in remarks at the U.S. Mexican border. ((ul))President Trump’s executive order expands the authority of immigration officials to deport non-U.S. citizens at the border. It also limits the discretion of prosecutors to prioritize cases as more or less urgent and takes away the ability of judges to close some cases temporarily to make room for more pressing ones.

Yet more and more of them have no legal representation. Like Rivas, they can’t afford an attorney or don’t have the time to find one. Pro-bono lawyers are maxed out. Alberti herself has 175 cases right now. Many of those who represent themselves find the convoluted tangle of U.S. immigration laws confusing. Bradley Jenkins, a pro bono attorney with the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, says there’s a good reason for that. “Immigration law is complex,” he says. “It’s more complex than the tax code.” “Many conscientious judges are very worried about getting it right and afraid of getting it wrong (with) these pressures to get through increased cases,” he adds. Justice Department spokesman Devin O’Malley says the administration inherited a massive number of deportation cases. “In 2010, longstanding immigration court benchmarks for non-detained cases were abruptly abandoned, and since that time — perhaps not coincidentally — the caseload has tripled,\" O’Malley explained in an email. Prioritizing cases that \"can be resolved more quickly in favor of cases that often take longer to complete\" will reduce the caseload, he says. The administration also is bringing back previously abandoned performance goals for courts and judges, another way to address the backlog, O'Malley says. He describes the administration's measures as \"a series of common-sense reforms that aim to reduce the so-called \"backlog\" by realigning the agency towards completing cases, increasing both productivity and capacity and changing policies that lead to inefficiencies and waste.\" Retired immigration Judge John O’Malley, a former Jackson County judge who became the first immigration judge in Kansas City in 2009 (and no relation to Devin O'Malley), is concerned about how that will play out.

(JM)","text":["((ul))President ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Trump unleashed an aggressive attack Sunday on unauthorized immigrants and the judicial system((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) that handles them, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))saying that those who cross into the United States illegally should be sent back immediately without due process or an appearance before a judge. ((/hl))((/ul))((hl))“((/hl))((ul))We cannot allow all of these people to invade our Country,” Mr. Trump tweeted((/ul)) while on the way to his golf course in Virginia. “((ul))When somebody comes in, we must immediately, with no Judges or Court Cases, bring them back from where they came.”((/ul)) It was another twist in a head-spinning series of developments on immigration since the administration announced a “zero tolerance” policy two months ago, leading to the separation of children from parents who cross the border illegally and an outcry from Democrats and many Republicans. Mr. Trump signed an executive order to end the separations last week, but the sudden shifts have led to confusion along the border about how children and parents will be reunited and to turmoil in Congress as the House prepares to vote on a sweeping immigration bill this week. Still, the president, who has always dug his heels in when criticized, has not backed back down from his hard-line talk, even amid a national outcry over a detainment policy that has resulted in the separation of more than 2,300 children from their families. ((ul))He has instead gone on the offensive, complaining to aides about why he could not just create an overarching executive order to solve the problem((/ul)), according to two people familiar with the deliberations. Aides have had to explain to the president why a comprehensive immigration overhaul is beyond the reach of his executive powers. ((ul))And privately, the president has groused that he should not have signed the order undoing separations((/ul)). “((ul))Our system is a mockery to good immigration policy and Law and Order,” Mr. Trump tweeted((/ul)) Sunday, adding, “((ul))Our Immigration policy, laughed at all over the world, is very unfair to all of those people who have gone through the system legally and are waiting on line for years! Immigration must be based on merit((/ul)).” But ((ul))Mr. Trump’s call to ignore due process faced both constitutional questions and dissension from Republicans in Congress, some of whom have insisted that the number of judges be increased so migrant families can have their cases heard more quickly. Federal immigration courts faced a backlog of more than 700,000 cases in May, and cases can take months or years to be heard. ((/ul))Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, has proposed doubling the number of judges to roughly 750, while Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin and chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” that he believes an additional 225 judges are needed. He noted that only 74 of the current immigration judges are serving at the border. “We need to increase that,” Mr. Johnson said. “The Trump administration is going to try and come up with another 15,000 beds for family units. But none of this is easy.” The House bill up for a vote this week would beef up border security and provide a path to citizenship for the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers, while also effectively codifying Mr. Trump’s executive order by allowing migrant families to be detained together indefinitely. Many on Capitol Hill believe legislation is necessary to deal with the order, since it allows indefinite detentions((ul)). Under a 1997 consent decree known as the Flores settlement, migrant children can be detained for no more than 20 days, leaving the order’s status in court in doubt. ((/ul))But the president’s conflicting statements are complicating legislative efforts, said Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona. “It makes it very difficult,” Mr. Flake said on ABC’s “This Week,” continuing, “It’s difficult in any event, right, in an election year where the president has decided to have this at the forefront of the Republican election strategy to paint the Democrats as soft on immigration.” He added: “((ul))I don’t know how in the world we’re going to fix this in the short term, given the Flores decision and given the lack of infrastructure, judges to process these claims. It’s really a big mess((/ul)).” Mr. Trump’s tweets on Sunday threw new legal questions into the puzzle. Laurence H. Tribe, a constitutional law professor at Harvard, said in an email that the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that “the due process requirements of the Fifth and 14th Amendments apply to all persons, including those in the U.S. unlawfully.” “((ul))((hl))Trump is making the tyrannical claim that he has the right to serve as prosecutor, judge and jury with respect to all those who enter our country((/hl))((/ul)),” Mr. Tribe said. “((ul))((hl))That is a breathtaking assertion of unbounded power — ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))power without any plausible limit.”((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))The Fifth Amendment mandates the due process of law, and the 14th Amendment, in part, expanded due process rights for immigrants, with case law asserting those rights dating back to 1886. But Justice Department lawyers under both Democratic and Republican administrations have argued that noncitizens apprehended at the border lack due process protections, said Adam Cox, a law professor at New York University, and the Supreme Court has never clearly resolved the dispute. ((ul))Since Mr. Trump was elected, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))his administration has been working to expand the terms of a 1996 statute that allows immigration officials to quickly deport undocumented immigrants((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) as well as those whose papers are believed to be fraudulent((/ul)). The Trump administration has the ability to expand the statute to encompass the entire country and apply it to any noncitizen who has not been in the country for more than two years, Mr. Cox said. “((ul))One of the things that is being considered is an expanded expedited removal to the full statutory limi((/ul))t,” he said, adding that “((ul))it is already true that a lot of people show up at the border get removed with no access to immigration courts or the judicial process.” ((/ul))Mr. Cox said ((ul))the president could be reacting to seeing a high number of people held in detention centers claiming they face harm back home((/ul)). The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether the president knew the legal ins and outs of his demand. “Many members of the administration seem to think that the high rate necessarily means a lot of fraud,” Mr. Cox said of asylum claims, “so what they could like to do is remove that process.” Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has made illegal immigration a focus of his career, has moved to back up the president’s words with action in recent months. In April, ((ul))Mr. Sessions announced a “zero tolerance” immigration policy, which set off the mass separation of families((/ul)) that the president sought to end with his executive order last week. ((ul))Criminal prosecutions for illegally crossing the southwestern border jumped to 8,298 in April, the month Mr. Sessions announced the zero-tolerance policy, an increase of 30 percent from March, according to data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a research institute at Syracuse University((/ul)). Last week, the Defense Department lent 21 lawyers to the Justice Department to focus on prosecuting a backlog in border crossing cases. And on Sunday, the defense secretary, Jim Mattis, said the Pentagon was looking at using two bases to hold an unknown number of migrants, though he would not comment on their location or whether they would house children. Omar Jadwat, director of the Immigrants’ Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union, called the president’s demand to dispense with due process illegal. “Any official who has sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution and laws should disavow it unequivocally,” he said. ((ul))M((/ul))((ul))r. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Trump’s call to end due process is not a total surprise — he has alluded to taking similar measures for weeks.((/hl))((/ul)) While in Las Vegas on Saturday, ((ul))Mr. Trump told supporters that he thought the immigration system needed fewer judges. Mr. Trump also suggested last week that he opposed adding judges because many of them could be corrupt.((/ul)) ((ul))He has long been a critic of immigration judges, saying they were not effective in stopping the flow of people coming into the country, sometimes using incorrect numbers to make his point. ((/ul))“((ul))We have thousands of judges. Do you think other countries have judges?” Mr. Trump said during a round-table discussion in May. “We give them, like, trials. That’s the good news. The bad news is, they never show up for the trial. O.K.?” There are actually fewer than 400 judges dedicated to such work((/ul)), according to the website PolitiFact. ((ul))Mr. Trump also tweeted on Friday that Republicans should “stop wasting their time” on the broad House immigration bill,((/ul)) but Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said on “Fox News Sunday” that he had spoken to the White House, which had assured him that Mr. Trump was “still 100 percent behind us.” Mr. Trump’s careening from one extreme to another has been a staple of his campaign and presidency, allowing people to hear what they want in what he says — and leaving his White House to sort through a messy pile of conflicting directives and Congress to grasp for clues about which bills he might support. The prospects for the House bill are iffy at best; some conservatives are balking at the citizenship provisions, which critics regard as “amnesty.” If it fails, Mr. McCaul said the House may be forced to consider a narrower measure — a so-called skinny bill — that would address only the issues surrounding detention of migrant families. “I think we at a minimum have to deal with the family separation,” Mr. McCaul said. “I’m a father of five.

((/ul))Williamson was a healthy 45-year-old man when he and Reynolds, held by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) pending deportation, arrived at the county-run Alabama jail after a snow-delayed, double-shackled trip from Massachusetts on Jan. 26, 2014. Reynolds said that months later, he brought food to the listless Williamson, propped him up so he could walk to the shower, contacted his ICE deportation officer, made entreaties to sheriff’s deputies and submitted written requests for medical care in his behalf. “IT’S THREE DAYS SINCE I HAVE ASK TO SEE THE DOCTOR,” Reynolds wrote on a request form sent in Williamson’s name on May 21, 2014. “. . . AND I’M PEEING BLOOD. CAN YOU PLEASE HELP ME.” The in-house medical staff eventually gave Williamson a strong antibiotic, but six days later it rejected his complaint that he “is unable to walk and feels funny all over” as “subjective,” according to medical records. Reynolds says a correction officer put it to him another way: “Medical is saying that, he’s—you know, he’s faking it. There ain’t nothing wrong with him.” “That place in Alabama, oh my God. That’s the worst place, that’s the worst place ever.” Reynolds reached out to a captain in the sheriff’s office for help—“I had to literally beg,” he says—and Williamson was held overnight in the jail’s clinic, then sent to a hospital in the morning for “general weakness.” Doctors there found that his urinary tract infection had spread throughout his body: It very nearly killed him. Within the hour he arrived in the emergency room, he suffered a heart attack due to septic shock, according to medical records. “Locked down my kidneys. It locked down my heart, and then it locked down my brain,” Williamson said in a recent telephone interview from Jamaica, where he was deported the week before Christmas last year. ((ul))He continues to suffer the medical consequences of his time at Etowah, but without the access to health care he’d have in the United States. ((/ul))“That place in Alabama, oh my God. That’s the worst place, that’s the worst place ever,” he said. ‘Not a Bed and Breakfast’ He’s not the only one saying that. ((ul))Advocates for immigrants have launched a campaign called Shut Down Etowah, calling for the federal government to end a contract begun some two decades ago. Significantly, a high-level Department of Homeland Security office—created by Congress to ensure that the agency upholds the public’s civil liberties—also urged ICE leaders to stop using the Etowah jail because of a long pattern of uncorrected civil rights violations. ((/ul))Located in Gadsden in northeastern Alabama, next to the courthouse where Judge Roy Moore began his judicial career by posting the Ten Commandments in his courtroom, ((ul))((hl))the Etowah County facility is emblematic of much of what’s wrong with the world’s largest immigration detention system((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)). The detainees are isolated from their families and from legal help, 500 miles from the immigration court. They’re held, longer than almost anywhere else in the system, in the wrong kind of facility((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). Like other jails, Etowah is meant for short-timers who are either awaiting trial or serving minor sentences, and not for civil detention—which is supposed to be non-punitive. So there is no outdoor recreation space. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Nor is there space for visitors to meet detainees((/hl))((/ul))((ul)); that’s done through video from an adjacent building. And pay for a sheriff’s detention deputy is $11.99 an hour, leading to turnover and an inexperienced staff. ((/ul))Now, the Trump administration is poised to ease the 18-year-old standards that county jails like Etowah must agree to maintain—rules that experts say are already weak and outdated. Meanwhile, a federal advisory council led by former FBI Director William Webster has urged ICE to do the opposite: Stop holding detainees in county jails for anything more than 72 hours. “IT’S THREE DAYS SINCE I HAVE ASK TO SEE THE DOCTOR… AND I’M PEEING BLOOD. CAN YOU PLEASE HELP ME.” “I think the Etowah facility should be closed,” Megan H. Mack, who headed Homeland Security’s Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties in the last two years of the Obama administration, told The Daily Beast. “It is not appropriate for housing immigration detainees and may be not for regular inmates either. The facility is inadequate.” A report released in June 2016 disclosed that that ((ul))the civil rights office of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which includes ICE, had called on the agency to stop holding detainees at Etowah. The office emphasized the gravity of the situation by issuing what it called its first “super-recommendation memorandum.” ((/ul))Mack had sent a May 28, 2015, memo to ICE leadership criticizing the agency for failing to respond to the changes her DHS office called for after on-site inspections of Etowah in 2006, 2008, and 2012. In the three years since the last inspection, her office said, 50 new complaints were under investigation. “We therefore conclude that serious problems persist,” the memo said. Given the findings of previous investigations, which were conducted by experts of national standing, the civil rights office concluded it “has strong reason to believe that many of these complaints identify real and continuing problems at the facility.” (DHS released a highly redacted version of the memo to the Adelante Alabama Worker Center and other non-profit organizations that filed suit for it under the Freedom of Information Act. The suit is continuing at U.S. District Court in Manhattan.) ((ul))Among these complaints were charges that spoiled food was served, and multiple reports of ICE officers roughing up handcuffed detainees to put their fingerprint on travel documents. ((/ul))Bryan Cox, a spokesman for ICE, said the agency “is aware of that report” and that other “inspections have consistently found the Etowah County Detention Center to operate in compliance with ICE’s rigorous national detention standards.” Even so, the most recent publicly available ICE Office of Detention Oversight compliance report for Etowah, based on a December 2016 inspection, found that the jail met only six of 15 standards surveyed, with deficiencies in food service and telephone access, which was overpriced. The 2016 report listed more more than twice as many deficiencies as the office’s previous report on Etowah, three years earlier. In recent months, the jail’s notoriety grew following disclosures that Etowah County Sheriff Todd Entrekin pocketed jail funding thanks to an Alabama law that allows sheriffs to keep surplus funds for food—money left over from serving meals that detainees say are so skimpy that they’re often hungry. Entrekin said that outside agencies frequently inspect his jail. “We have passed those inspections with flying colors each and every time,” he claimed in a March 23 news conference. Entrekin and his spokesperson have not returned numerous messages and calls seeking comment for this article. At the news conference, Entrekin insisted the food he serves is nutritious and healthy. The sheriff released his tax returns and answered reporters’ questions about his finances to demonstrate his contention that it was legal for him to take $750,000 over three years in “surplus” food money paid by the state and federal governments. “This is not a bed and breakfast,” he said, scoffing at detainees who said they were revolted by the food. Entrekin’s protestations did not impress Etowah County voters, who ousted him by a 2-to-1 margin in a June 5 Republican primary. The winner, Rainbow City Police Chief Jonothon Horton, pledged that he would not take any of the jail money for himself. ICE, however, has not taken a public stand on Entrekin’s use of the jail funds and did not respond to a request for comment . ‘A Step Backwards’ ((ul))Even setting aside the Etowah County jail’s checkered history, experts say it would still be a poor choice for jailing immigrants long-term. ((/ul))Kevin Landy, a former ICE assistant director who headed the agency’s Office of Detention Policy and Planning, said county jails like Etowah are intended for short-term detention of people awaiting trial or serving misdemeanor sentences, not for years of incarceration. “My opinion is the agency’s use of Etowah as a long-term detention facility is inappropriate,” he said. “((ul))Due to its remote location and the conditions at the facility, that jail should at most be used for the short-term detention of individuals apprehended nearby and awaiting transfer to a more suitable facility.((/ul)) That policy would result in a substantially reduced population at Etowah.” While ICE’s use of privately run facilities has drawn much criticism, its deals with county jails have received less attention. But, as an internal advisory council warned DHS in a December 2016 report, ((ul))many experts and government officials believe that “county jails are, in general, the most problematic facilities for immigration detention.”((/ul)) The Homeland Security Advisory Council, headed by Webster, recommended that ICE “use county jails only for short-term detention (less than 72 hours) before transfer to larger and higher-quality dedicated facilities”—that is, facilities used only to detain immigrants. “It won’t be an improvement overall if we phase out private facilities and it results in a greater use of county detention facilities,” said council member David Martin, former deputy general counsel to the Department of Homeland Security and professor emeritus of law at the University of Virginia. But, he added, “((ul))this administration, that’s not a priority for them. They’re looking to expand the use of detention and make more detention facilities available.” ((/ul))A spokeswoman for ICE, Danielle Bennett, said it would be “operationally infeasible” for ICE to limit detention in county jails to no more than 72 hours. In fact, ((ul))((hl))ICE is planning to make it easier for county-run facilities like Etowah to comply with federal standards for holding detainees long-term.((/hl))((/ul))"],"stats":{"highlightedWords":81}},{"tag":"Plan: The USFG should remove immigration courts from under the DOJ and place them in their own system in addition to hiring more judges\nRemoving immigration courts from DOJ and hiring more judges solves for backlog","cite":"((ul))Melanie ((/ul))Huettman, 2017,,\"The Causes of our Immigration Court Backlog, and How We Can Fix It,\" Niskanen Center, Melanie Huettman is a graduate of Iowa University and is editor in chief at the Journal of Gender, Race, and Justice, https://niskanencenter.org/blog/causes-immigration-court-backlog-can-fix-2/, WB","text":["The ((ul))((hl))number of cases pending in the immigration court system is currently at an ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))all-time high((/hl))((/ul)).

((ul))By expanding enforcement priorities without a corresponding expansion of court personnel, President Trump’s policies are making that backlog worse((/ul)). As a result, immigration-related arrests have skyrocketed, increasing by 38 percent this year, but adjudication rates have remained the same. The overflowing dockets of immigration judges have led to nightmarish scheduling delays. Currently, ((ul))according to TRAC, the average wait time for a Master Calendar hearing((/ul))((ul))—a preliminary hearing meant to provide a chance to plead and schedule an actual merits hearing—((/ul))((ul))is nine months. After that, many wait upwards of 670 days to have their case heard((/ul))((ul)). ((/ul))((ul))Some wait((/ul))((ul)) four to ((/ul))((ul))five years((/ul))((ul)). The huge backlog of cases is harming immigrants who are stuck in limbo as they wait to learn their fate. It can ruin their chances of receiving pro bono representation, which is usually necessary to win a case((/ul)). Worse still, asylum seekers have seen their backlog more than quadruple in the last five years. In the years they wait for a decision on their case, witnesses disappear and evidence becomes outdated, drastically reducing their chance of making a successful claim. Meanwhile, family members may be stuck in their dangerous home countries, waiting for the asylum case to be resolved to escape. Additionally, the existing backlog poses a potential threat to our public safety and national security, while also creating negative economic effects. The delays allow immigrants picked up for criminal convictions or charges to roam free in the United States for years afterward without much in the way of supervision. Further, while these individuals wait for their hearings, they often can’t work and have to rely on benefits—especially true for asylees((ul)). ((/ul))((ul))((hl))It is therefore in our interest to reduce the delays and get these cases through quickly((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)). ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))While the number of cases has increased, the main cause of the backlog is the failure to hire enough immigration judges to deal with the influx((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)).((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) There are currently ((/ul))((ul))only((/ul))((ul)) 58 immigration courts throughout the country, situated in 27 states, Guam, and Puerto Rico((/ul))((ul)).

((/ul))((ul))Attorney General Sessions ((/ul))((ul))has plans((/ul))((ul)) to hire 50 new judges this year, and 75 next year, ((/ul))((ul))in order to deal with the caseload((/ul))((ul)). However, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))this modest increase in judges will not((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))be enough to((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))cover the new influx of cases, much less ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))tackle((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) the existing backlog((/hl))((/ul)). According to a report by Human Rights First, the system needs over 500 judges completing at least 500 cases each year until 2023 in order to end the backlog. Since it currently takes close to two years to hire an immigration judge, it is unlikely that this backlog will be dealt with anytime soon. ((ul))Solutions There are a few things the((/ul))((ul)) Trump ((/ul))((ul))administration could do to reduce the backlog((/ul))((ul)) and improve the immigration court system. First, ((/ul))((ul))the administration should focus its resources on increasing the number of immigration judges. This would not only reduce the backlog, but also help alleviate the pressure on the existing judges, and allow them to focus more on individual cases rather than speeding through them((/ul))((ul)). ((/ul))Second, the administration should ensure that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)((ul)) is prioritizing criminals and dangerous undocumented immigrants rather than targeting all undocumented individuals. By focusing enforcement resources on removing only those who commit crimes and pose a real danger to society, the administration would not only further its goal of making our country safer, it would also reduce the backlog. Third, as the American Bar Association and the President of the National Association of Immigration Judges, the Hon. Dana Leigh Marks, ((/ul))((ul))suggested((/ul))((ul)), it could be beneficial if Congress were to remove the immigration court system from under the Department of Justice and allow it to be its own system, like the current system of bankruptcy court((/ul))((ul))s. This idea was ((/ul))((ul))first introduced((/ul))((ul)) in 1981 by the Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy. ((/ul))((ul))The new system would still handle immigration issues, but the judges would have more control over the system and their own dockets. It would also allow for the creation of both a trial and appellate division to better resolve any errors made during cases, as well as provide national, binding caselaw. Additionally, separating them from the Department of Justice would reduce much of the politicization entrenched within the system((/ul))((ul)). Many of President Trump’s current immigration policies serve only to further strain an already overburdened system((/ul)). By increasing the number of immigration judges and enforcing removal priorities, the backlog could be alleviated, hundreds of thousands of immigrants could be saved from years of waiting, and we could get dangerous criminals off of the streets.

This does not include the time a judge needs in camera to review the hundreds of pages of evidence in the record. In reality, a judge who completes one asylum case a day, and not three, is already extremely efficient. The real problem is not with how hard-working the immigration judges are. As I explained in a 2016 article, part of ((ul))the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))problem lies with understaffing((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). Instead of hiring a reasonable number of judges and law clerks, and otherwise investing in supporting the work of our Immigration Judges, the Administration is ((/ul))((ul))eliminating administrative closure((/ul))((ul)) and ((/ul))((ul))calling for administratively closed cases to be put back on the docket((/ul)), ((ul))actions that only serve to raise the number of pending cases.((/ul)) If, for example, the Department of Justice puts all the administratively closed cases back on the docket, it would increase the court backlog to over 1,000,000. These are cases of crime victims and DACA recipients and others where an immigration judge has already determined that it would not be a good use of judicial resources, or in the public interest, to litigate, usually because the person is eligible for some non-judicial form of immigration relief and has a case pending with USCIS. Re-calendaring these cases would not only unnecessarily increase the work of taxpayer-funded DHS Trial Attorneys but it would add more pressure to the already overworked immigration judges. The attorney general has also stepped into managing the immigration courts by restricting the use of continuances, which in the fast-paced detention context where my organization works are often necessary in order to have time to obtain crucial pieces of evidence and otherwise prepare for trial. While the attorney general is the boss and is responsible for the judges’ performance, he should have a little more faith in the good judgement of his immigration judges, who, unlike the attorney general, are looking at the situation-specific issues in the individual case before them. While the helpfulness of the attorney general’s methods for carrying out his job are questionable at best, ((ul))the underlying problem remains that, regardless of our political opinion on the administration’s policies, those policies are affecting the judicial independence of our immigration courts and putting due process in jeopardy((/ul)). What the attorney general says matters to the immigration judges working under him. In one recent case, the immigration judge cited him as saying there is a lot of fraud in the asylum process as evidence that the asylum seeker was lying. Not only was the attorney general’s statement not based on facts — at least not on facts made publicly available, or that anyone even claimed exist, and which statement runs in stark contrast to my six years of on-the-ground experience — but that statement had nothing to do with the truthfulness of the individual asylum seeker present before the court. Additionally, as stated by the former president of the National Association of Immigration Judges Dana Marks((ul)), ((/ul))((ul))((hl))there is a ‘‘((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))conflict of interest between the judicial and prosecutorial functions((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) [((/hl))((/ul))((ul))of the Department of Justice that] ((/ul))((ul))((hl))creates a significant((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) (and perhaps even fatal) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))flaw to the immigration court structure((/hl))((/ul)).’’ ((ul))It appears that the administration is looking for specific outcomes in cases with little regard to the merits of the claim. The attorney general has ((/ul))((ul))certified an unprecedented number cases to himself for review((/ul))((ul)) with the idea that he might change the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals((/ul)). This extraordinary power of one political-appointee to overturn the decision of trained immigration judges is fundamentally at odds with judicial independence. ((ul))Unfortunately, it appears that not only the review and firing of judges has become political, but their hiring too. Information has surfaced that the ((/ul))((ul))Department of Justice is asking candidates questions about their political party affiliation((/ul))((ul)), their position on same-sex relationships, and their opinion on abortion; preparing internal memos on those whose immigration views that do not align with the administration’s policies; slowing down review of applications where there are ideological differences; and withdrawing employment offers or delaying start dates by up to a one and a half years((/ul)).((ul)) Making judicial decisions subject to the political whims of the times, and not dependent on the accurate execution of the law, is a serious risk to the checks-and-balances system underlying our democracy. The need for independent immigration courts has never been clearer.((/ul))"],"stats":{"highlightedWords":79}},{"tag":"Recent polls suggest broad bipartisan support for asylum reform.","cite":" Eleanor Acer March 27, 2015 Human Rights First, “Americans Overwhelmingly Support Asylum Reform to Protect Refugees” https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/blog/poll-americans-overwhelmingly-support-asylum-reform-protect-refugees As the director of Human Rights First’s Refugee Protection program, Eleanor Acer oversees Human Rights First’s research and advocacy on issues relating to refugee protection, asylum, and migrants’ rights.

He is a partner at Dzubow & Pilcher, PLLC. (JM)","text":["The Republican Party Platform is finally here (yippee!). While the document does not bind either the party or its candidate, it does tell us something about Republican thinking on a wide variety of topics. Two paragraphs in the 54-page Platform cover asylum and refugee issues, and I want to discuss those here. ((ul))((hl))The RNC Platform would block “the gays” from receiving asylum in the U.((/hl))((/ul))((ul))S. It would also make it easier for them to get asylum FROM the U.S. ((/ul))Interestingly, the Platform itself does not call for a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” However, ((ul))it does view asylum through the prism of national security, and it does place extra scrutiny on people coming from “regions associated with Islamic terrorism.”((/ul)) The first paragraph of interest (found on page 26 of the Platform) reconfirms America’s commitment to assisting refugees, but with a few caveats– From its beginning, our country has been a haven of refuge and asylum. That should continue — but with major changes. ((ul))Asylum should be limited to cases of political, ethnic or religious persecution((/ul)). As the Director of the FBI has noted, it is not possible to vet fully all potential refugees. ((ul))To ensure our national security, refugees who cannot be carefully vetted cannot be admitted to the country, especially those whose homelands have been the breeding grounds for terrorism((/ul)). I take issue with a few points here. First, the Platform seeks to limit asylum to people who face “political, ethnic or religious persecution.” Under our current law, a person can qualify for asylum if she fears persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or particular social group. Presumably, “ethnic” persecution in the Platform refers to persecution on account of race or nationality under existing law, which means that four of the five protected categories are covered in the RNC document. ((ul))((hl))Conspicuously absent from the Platform’s language, however, is protection for people who are members of a “particular social group.”((/hl))((/ul)) This omission is significant for a few reasons. First, it ((ul))contravenes our treaty obligations (we are signatories to the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, which covers all five protected categories). If we seek to modify our obligations under the treaty, other countries may follow suit. This would have an unfortunate ripple effect on refugee protection throughout the world. It would also downgrade our leadership role with regards to refugee resettlement, and may signal a withdrawal of our leadership in world affairs more generally.((/ul)) Second, ((ul))the change would mean that we no longer offer refuge to many people who we now protect. Those who fear persecution on account of sexual orientation, female genital mutilation, and domestic violence are some prime examples of people we protect because they are members of a particular social group((/ul)) (“PSG”). Indeed, those refugees most affected by this change would be women and sexual minorities. I suppose this is consistent with the rest of the RNC Platform, which–to say the least–is not all that friendly towards women or LGBT individuals. Third, eliminating PSG as a protected category would effectively end any possibility for relief for the unaccompanied minors who have been arriving at our Southern border in large numbers since about 2012. Most of these young people are fleeing violence in Central America. They already have a difficult time obtaining protection in the U.S., but if the PSG category were eliminated, the likelihood that any of them could obtain asylum would become virtually nil. The second paragraph in the RNC Platform related to refugees appears on page 42 of the document– [We] cannot ignore the reality that border security is a national security issue, and that our nation’s immigration and refugee policies are placing Americans at risk. ((ul))To keep our people safe, we must secure our borders, enforce our immigration laws, and properly screen refugees and other immigrants entering from any country. In particular we must apply special scrutiny to those foreign nationals seeking to enter the United States from terror-sponsoring countries or from regions associated with Islamic terrorism((/ul)). This was done successfully after September 11, 2001, under the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System, which should be renewed now. I take issue with a number of points in this paragraph, but here I will discuss only those related to refugees. First, the paragraph echos Donald Trump, who has claimed that we don’t know where these refugees come from, or who they are. This is utterly false. In truth, we know far more about the refugees who come here than we know about other categories of immigrants or non-immigrant visitors. Refugees are subject to intensive screenings and multiple background checks. Indeed, we probably know more about the refugees (and immigrants) entering our country than we know about our own citizens, and most studies show that such people are less likely to commit crimes than the native born. I also disagree with the Platform’s plan to re-start the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System (“NSEERS”), which was suspended in 2011. Under NSEERS, men and boys from many Arab and Muslim countries were required to specially register with the U.S. government. The confusing system led to great difficulty for many of these people (and their families), but resulted in no terrorism-related convictions. In other words, there is basically no evidence that NSEERS made us any safer, but there is plenty of evidence that it harmed innocent people who happened to be from Arab or Muslim countries. Finally, there is one point in the Platform that I agree with: We must continue to screen refugees and others who come to our country from regions that produce terrorists (and from everywhere else as well). Of course, we already do this, and I don’t think there is anyone in American who thinks we should do otherwise. The RNC’s implied accusation here is that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have been letting un-vetted refugees enter our country. That is a lie, and anyone who follows the painfully-slow process of refugee admissions knows it. ((ul))((hl))What little the RNC has to say in its Platform is not good for refugees, and it is especially bad for refugees who happen to be women, children, LGBT individuals or Muslims.((/hl))((/ul)) If there is a silver lining here, I suppose it is that the Platform devotes only two paragraphs to refugee issues.

(JM)","text":["((ul))A few weeks ago, the contours of an immigration compromise looked clear: Republicans would let the “Dreamers” stay. Democrats would let Trump build his wall.((/ul)) Both sides would swallow something their bases found distasteful in order to get the thing their bases cared about most. Since then, ((ul))Trump has blown up the deal((/ul)). He announced on Wednesday that he would legalize the “Dreamers,” undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, only if Democrats funded his wall and ended the visa lottery and “chain migration.” ((ul))He would support a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants only if Congress brought the number of legal immigrants down. ((/ul))There’s an irony here, which was pointed out to me by CATO Institute immigration analyst David Bier. Until recently, Republican politicians drew a bright line between illegal immigration, which they claimed to hate, and legal immigration, which they claimed to love. Florida Senator Marco Rubio launched his presidential campaign at the Freedom Tower, Miami’s Ellis Island. Texas Senator Ted Cruz, who in 2013 proposed a five-fold increase in the number of H1B visas for highly skilled immigrants, declared in April 2015 that, “There is no stronger advocate for legal immigration in the U.S. Senate than I am.” Mitt Romney promised in 2007 that, “We’re going to end illegal immigration to protect legal immigration.” Trump has turned that distinction on its head. He’s willing to legalize the “Dreamers”—who came to the United States illegally—so long as the number of legal immigrants goes down. ((ul))He has not only blurred the GOP’s long-held moral distinction between legal and illegal immigration. In some ways, he’s actually flipped it—taking a harder line on people who enter the U.S. with documentation than those who don’t. ((/ul))What explains this((ul))? Trump’s great hidden advantage during the 2016 Republican presidential primary was his lack of support from the GOP political and donor class.((/ul)) This allowed him to jettison positions—in support of free trade, in support of the Iraq War, in support of cutting Medicare and Social Security—that enjoyed support among Republican elites but little support among Republican voters. He did the same on immigration, where ((ul))the “legal good, illegal bad” distinction turned out to be much more popular among the party’s leaders than among its grassroots.((/ul)) Cribbing from Ann Coulter’s book, Adios America, ((ul))((hl))Trump replaced the legal-illegal distinction with one that turned out to have more resonance on the activist right: ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))The distinction between white Christian immigrants and non-white, and non-Christian ones((/hl))((/ul)). The words “illegal immigration” do not appear in Trump’s presidential announcement speech. ((ul))Instead, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Trump focused on immigrants’ country of origin((/hl))((/ul)). “When Mexico sends its people,” he declared, “they’re not sending their best … They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists … It’s coming from more than Mexico. It’s coming from all over South and Latin America, and it’s coming probably—probably—from the Middle East.” Trump, who often says bluntly what other Republicans say in code, probably realized that “((ul))illegal immigrant” was, for many voters, already a euphemism for Latino or Mexican-immigrants.((/ul)) In their book White Backlash, the political scientists Marisa Abrajano and Zoltan Hajnal cite a poll showing that 61 percent of Americans believe that most Latino immigrants are undocumented even though only about a quarter are((ul)). “When Americans talk about undocumented immigrants, Latinos or immigrants in general,” they note, “the images in their heads are likely to be the same.” What really drove Republican opinion about immigration, Trump realized((/ul)), was not primarily the fear that the United States was becoming a country of law-breakers. (Republicans, after all, were not outraged about the lack of prosecution of tax cheats.) It ((ul))was the fear that the United States—which was becoming less white and had just elected a president of Kenyan descent—was becoming a third-world country. ((/ul))When the Public Religion Research Institute and Brookings Institution asked Americans in 2016 their views of immigration from different parts of the world, it found that ((ul))Republicans were only three points more likely than Democrats to want to reduce immigration from “predominantly Christian countries” and only seven points more likely to want to reduce immigration from Europe. By contrast, they were 33 points more likely to support reducing immigration from Mexico and Central America and 41 points more likely to support reducing immigration from “predominantly Muslim countries.” ((/ul))((ul))((hl))What really drives Republican views about immigrants, ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))in other words, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))is less their legal status than ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))their nation of origin, their religion, and their race((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)).((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))Trump grasped that during the campaign, and in coalition with a bevy of current and former Southern Senators—Jeff Sessions, David Perdue and Tom Cotton—he has used it to turn the GOP into a party devoted to slashing legal immigration. On Thursday, ((ul))when presented with a bill that traded the legalization of Dreamers for more border security but did not reduce legal immigration, only eight Republican Senators voted yes. However, 37 voted for a bill that legalized the “Dreamers,” added more border security, and substantially reduced legal immigration. ((/ul))But there’s another reason Trump has succeeded in erasing the “legal good, illegal bad” distinction that for years governed GOP immigration debate. ((ul))He’s made Republicans less concerned with legality in general.((/ul)) In 2012, the GOP—which was then-outraged by executive orders that supposedly displayed President Barack Obama’s contempt for the constitutional limits of his office—titled the immigration section of its platform, “The Rule of Law: Legal Immigration.” The seven paragraph-section used variations of the word “law” 14 times. That emphasis is harder now. In his ongoing battles with the FBI, Justice Department, judiciary, and Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Trump has convinced many Republicans that the “rule of law” is often a cloak for the partisan biases of the “deep state.” As a result, Republicans are now 22 points less likely to hold a positive opinion of the FBI than they were in 2015. What really matters for many Republicans in Trump’s standoff with Mueller and the FBI is not who has the law on their side, since the bureaucracy can twist the law to its own advantage. ((ul))((hl))What really matters is who enjoys the backing of “the people((/hl))((/ul))((ul)),”((/ul)) the authentic America that resides outside the swamp, a construct that definitely does not include the imagined beneficiaries of “chain migration” and the “visa lottery.” In the Trump era, ((ul))Republicans now justify their immigration views less by reference to law than by reference to tribe((/ul)).

Many countries have started developing and implementing national influenza pandemic preparedness plans. However, the level of preparedness varies among countries. Developing countries encounter unique and difficult issues and challenges in preparing for a pandemic. Deaths attributable to an influenza pandemic could be substantially higher in developing countries than in industrialized countries. Pharmaceutical interventions such as vaccines and antiviral agents are less likely to be available in developing countries. The public health and clinical infrastructure of developing countries are often inadequate to deal with a widespread health crisis such as an influenza pandemic. Such an event will inevitably have a global effect. Therefore, improving pandemic preparedness in every country, particularly developing ones, is urgently needed.Avian influenza, caused by influenza A virus (H5N1), continues to cause outbreaks among poultry and wild birds worldwide. It has spread from Asia to other regions, including Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. The number of cases of human subtype H5N1 infection also continues to rise. These historically unprecedented outbreaks have raised serious global concerns about the imminent arrival of an influenza pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) urges countries to develop and implement national pandemic preparedness plans to mitigate the health and social effects of a pandemic (1). However, the level of preparedness varies among countries. In general, developing countries have limited financial and technical resources to strengthen pandemic preparedness. They also face some unique and difficult issues, which make preparing for a pandemic more challenging. These have not been addressed adequately during planning. Effective and feasible strategies are needed to mitigate the impact of the next influenza pandemic in developing countries.When an influenza pandemic emerges, all countries worldwide will inevitably be affected. However, the impact may vary both between and within countries. The estimated deaths for various countries during the Spanish flu pandemic from 1918 to 1920 shows that mortality rates in Europe and North America were significantly lower than those in Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America (2,3). ((ul))A recent study that estimated the global impact of ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the Spanish flu((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) pandemic indicated that a considerable difference in mortality rates was observed between high- and low-income countries (((/ul))((ul))4((/ul))((ul))). Why ((/ul))((ul))the pandemic((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))caused such high mortality rates((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) in developing countries is not entirely clear. Several ((/ul))((ul))((hl))factors((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) may have been involved, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))includ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))ing ((/ul))((ul))((hl))lack of access to adequate medical care, weak public health infrastructures((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), social factors such as housing conditions and population density, and host factors such as nutritional status and co-existing medical conditions. Another potential factor likely to influence mortality in a future pandemic is the high HIV/AIDS prevalence in some developing countries. Excess deaths attributed to pneumonia or influenza are significantly higher((/ul)) in HIV-positive persons during influenza seasons (5). HIV co-infection with a pandemic virus can be associated with more severe infections, which may further raise death rates in countries with high HIV/AIDS prevalence.For these reasons, deaths associated with a future pandemic may be greater in developing countries than in industrialized countries. One study concluded that 96% of the estimated 62 million deaths in a future pandemic would occur in developing countries (4). The impact of such high mortality rates obviously needs to be taken into account when creating pandemic preparedness plans for developing countries. However, no appropriate model that can estimate the impact of an influenza pandemic in developing countries exists. Models are based on data from industrialized countries (6), which may underestimate the actual impact of a pandemic in developing countries.Several possible interventions can be implemented to control or mitigate the effects of an influenza pandemic, which include pharmaceutical interventions such as vaccines and antiviral agents, and nonpharmaceutical interventions such as quarantine, isolation, social distancing, and personal hygiene (7). Pharmaceutical interventions are needed for mitigating the impact of an influenza pandemic (8). Vaccines for subtype H5N1 viruses are currently being developed, and clinical trials are under way (9,10). However, worldwide vaccine production capacity is limited and is primarily in industrialized countries, where most seasonal influenza vaccine is produced (11). A recent WHO report estimated that the worldwide vaccine production capacity for current influenza vaccines is 350 million doses per year (12). That level of production is clearly insufficient to supply vaccines to all countries. Only a limited number of vaccine doses would be available, particularly in the early stages of the pandemic, and most of them would likely be supplied to industrialized countries. Many countries, especially developing countries, will be forced to confront the next pandemic with few or no available vaccines.Antiviral agents are also considered effective for an influenza pandemic. They are particularly useful in the early stages of a pandemic when there is a shortage of vaccines (13). Two groups of antiviral agents for influenza are currently available, including M2 ion-channel inhibitors (amantadine and rimantadine) and neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir). Neuraminidase inhibitors are preferred because some influenza viruses show high frequencies of resistance to M2 ion-channel inhibitors (14). Stockpiling of neuraminidase inhibitors is under way in many industrialized countries as part of national influenza pandemic preparedness (15). However, the ((ul))stockpiles of antiviral agents available in developing countries are small and limited((/ul)). WHO has global and regional stockpiles of antiviral agents, which are limited and are specifically used for early response and containment. The stockpile of antiviral agents is insufficient for a global pandemic.The most critical limiting factor for stockpiling of neuraminidase inhibitors in developing countries is their high cost. One treatment course of oseltamivir (i.e., 10 tablets) costs US $15, even at a discount rate (16), which is far too expensive for developing countries. Some industrialized countries have set a target to stockpile oseltamivir to treat 25% of the general population. To purchase adequate oseltamivir for 25% of the total population, only 0.11% of the total annual health expenditure is required in high-income countries. In low-income countries, however, the expense would be 12.9% of the annual expenditure (Table 1). Therefore, it is not feasible for low-income countries to allocate scarce resources to stockpile sufficient quantities of oseltamivir for an unpredictable influenza pandemic.The recent efforts to increase global availability of vaccines and antiviral agents can contribute to increasing the global availability of these pharmaceutical interventions. However, increased availability alone will not solve all the problems in many countries. Several other issues need to be addressed to implement pharmaceutical interventions. These pharmaceutical commodities, including syringes and needles for vaccines, should be delivered to healthcare facilities throughout the country. That is a difficult logistic challenge for many developing countries. Human resources are also required to implement these interventions. Yet, there are some uncertainties about the effectiveness of these pharmaceutical interventions. Even neuraminidase inhibitors may not be fully effective for a pandemic virus, whose pathogenesis in human hosts differs from that of seasonal influenza viruses. Another potential problem with the antiviral drugs is the risk that resistant strains will emerge. Vaccines may not be effective because of antigenic differences between a vaccine strain and a pandemic virus, or for other reasons. Full-scale implementation of pharmaceutical interventions that requires enormous financial and human resources may not be the best use of limited resources in developing countries. The governments, international organizations such as WHO, and donors should consider various factors when providing support for pharmaceutical interventions in developing countries. Maintaining a balance between pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical interventions is necessary to achieve the best use of limited resources. ((ul))((hl))During an influenza pandemic, morbidity and mortality may be extremely high. Healthcare facilities would be quickly overwhelmed with increased numbers of patients((/hl))((/ul)). In the United States alone, an estimated 18–42 million outpatient visits and 314,000–734,000 hospitalizations could occur (6). The surge capacity in healthcare systems will likely be insufficient to cope with this rise in patient numbers, even in industrialized countries (17,18). Healthcare resources such as the number of physicians, nurses, and available hospital beds are limited in developing countries. In some countries, resources are insufficient to cope with patients even during normal circumstances. Hospitals and clinics in developing countries will be easily overwhelmed by the increasing number of patients during an influenza pandemic.","Using the method described by Wilson et al. (19), we estimated the number of required hospital admissions for countries of varying economic status. The percentages of available hospital beds occupied by influenza patients at incidence rates of 15% and 35% were calculated by using FluSurge software, version 2.0 (20). (WHOSIS, www.who.int/whosis/en). Results are shown in Table 2. The percentage of hospital beds required for patients with pandemic influenza is much higher in low-income countries than in high-income countries. With an incidence rate of 35%, up to 79.1% of hospital beds are required for patients with pandemic influenza in low-income countries. In countries like Bangladesh and Nepal, >100% of beds would be required for patients with pandemic influenza, even at the incidence rate of 15% (data not shown). This model is based on data from the United States, and the difference in disease severity among the countries was not considered. This model may underestimate the hospital bed requirements in developing countries, where a pandemic virus may cause more severe infections. Some hospitalized patients will require mechanical ventilation (17), but few mechanical ventilators, if any, are available in many hospitals in developing countries.","During an influenza pandemic, additional essential medical supplies such as gloves, masks, syringes, antipyretics, and antimicrobial agents will also be required. These supplies are insufficient in healthcare facilities in developing countries, even in nonemergency situations. Lack of these supplies may hamper provision of adequate medical care for patients with pandemic influenza. Basic personal protective equipment such as disposable gloves and surgical masks are needed for protecting healthcare workers. Antimicrobial agents are expected to be effective for secondary bacterial pneumonia, which can be a major cause of death for patients with pandemic influenza (21). Therefore, proper treatment with antimicrobial agents can be crucial for preventing deaths. However, in some developing countries, sufficient stocks of essential drugs, including antimicrobial agents, are often unavailable.","In countries with limited healthcare resources, providing routine medical care for other conditions may become difficult during a pandemic. For example, the treatment for tuberculosis or the antiretroviral treatment for AIDS patients may not be provided because of disruption in healthcare systems. Maintaining other public health programs, such as vaccination, may also be difficult when most of public health resources are spent for the response to a pandemic.","To minimize the impact of an influenza pandemic, good preparedness plans need to be developed. With the increasing risk for a pandemic caused by the spread of influenza A virus (H5N1), most countries have started such planning. These national plans were recently reviewed from different perspectives (15,22–24). The level of planning in many developing countries is still inadequate to deal with such a major public health crisis. Some plans are based on the available plans of industrialized countries, or follow similar approaches to those of industrialized countries. As described above, the approaches used by industrialized countries may not be feasible or appropriate for developing countries. In addition, each country has specific issues, and therefore it should develop a plan based on its own requirements. This task can be difficult for most developing countries because they have little or no expertise with influenza and pandemic preparedness. For the few infectious disease experts working on infectious diseases in each country, numerous competing priorities exist, such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and vaccine-preventable diseases. Feasible, user-friendly tools are needed to assist these countries. WHO has developed several such tools, including a checklist for national preparedness (25). However, these tools describe the general approaches to pandemic preparedness and are not specifically designed for countries with limited resources. For developing countries more practical tools are needed, among them models to estimate the impact of a pandemic in developing countries, a list of feasible interventions to mitigate the impact of pandemic without available pharmaceutical interventions, and planning guidelines for hospitals with limited resources. ((ul))If the next pandemic occurs in a few years, vaccines and antiviral agents, particularly neuraminidase inhibitors, may not be available as a main intervention in developing countries((/ul)). Availability needs to be increased to fill the gaps between developed and industrialized countries. WHO recommends an increase in worldwide vaccine production to meet the demand during a pandemic (12). Several countries have initiated projects to improve influenza vaccine production with technical and financial support from WHO and donors. However, improved vaccine production capacity is not sustainable if only used for pandemic influenza vaccines. The use of seasonal influenza vaccines would also need to increase in these countries. However, the cost of the vaccines (US $3–$7 per dose) is a barrier in increasing their use (12). There is also little available evidence on the effectiveness and cost benefits of seasonal influenza vaccines in tropical developing countries. Further efforts should be made to reduce the cost and to collect additional scientific data to increase the use of seasonal influenza vaccines.Some approaches have been proposed and tested to reduce the amount of antigens per vaccine dose for pandemic vaccine so that more vaccines, including adjuvant and whole virion vaccines, can be supplied (10). The world is expected to have an increased capacity to produce vaccines for pandemic influenza viruses by 2010 (12). In some countries, the vaccines for the subtype with a pandemic potential are being produced and stockpiled as a prepandemic vaccine, which can be a useful tool to mitigate the impact of a pandemic (26). However, both pandemic and prepandemic vaccines would not be available in developing countries unless an international mechanism exists to share such vaccines with them at a low cost.","Some actions have also been taken to reduce the cost of neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir. It is being produced in sublicensing companies in developing countries to increase its supply at a lower cost. However, oseltamivir may still not be affordable for many developing countries. In industrialized countries, M2 ion-channel inhibitors are not considered a first choice of treatment because of the high rate of resistance to these inhibitors. However, amantadine is much cheaper than neuraminidase inhibitors and is more widely available. Most subtype H5N1 isolates that belong to clade 1 are resistant to amantadine, but many clade 2 viruses are still susceptible to amantadine (27). M2 ion-channel inhibitors can be a valid option for a pandemic, especially in developing countries (28). The value of M2 ion-channel inhibitors as a treatment option for an influenza pandemic should be evaluated further. The health consequences of a pandemic, including deaths, can be substantially reduced by providing better medical care. Several issues need to be addressed to provide adequate medical care during a pandemic. First, essential medical supplies such as masks, gloves, and antimicrobial agents should be available in hospitals and clinics. The stockpiles of these basic supplies can be more cost-effective in developing countries than the stockpiles of more expensive antiviral agents. Guidelines on the types and quantity of essential items that are required in hospitals and clinics should be developed. Second, healthcare personnel should be trained for infection control measures. Even surgical masks are not commonly used in many developing countries, and hand hygiene practices are not always followed. Basic training on infection control should be provided to improve pandemic preparedness in healthcare settings. Third, healthcare and public health systems need to be maintained to minimize the impact of a pandemic. These systems should be maintained to deal not only with a pandemic but also with other health problems such as malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV.More feasible and effective strategies should be developed as soon as possible to mitigate the negative impact of an influenza pandemic in developing countries. Since the availability of pharmaceutical interventions in developing countries is less likely, nonpharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing and personal hygiene may be the only available interventions. Public health measures such as school closure and household quarantine have been evaluated by using mathematical models for their effectiveness in mitigating the impact of a pandemic (29,30) and may have potential beneficial effects. However, the models suggest that substantial benefits of these measures require implementation with antiviral prophylaxis or vaccines (29,30). The evidence for effectiveness of public health measures is limited and is based primarily on experience in industrialized countries (31,32). For example, handwashing and hand hygiene have been highly publicized as a core management strategy for avian and pandemic influenza in developing countries (33). Although handwashing is effective in reducing the incidence of common diseases such as acute respiratory infections (34), data on its effectiveness specifically for community-acquired influenza infections are limited (31). Recommendations on nonpharmaceutical interventions have been based on available evidence (35). Accumulation of further scientific evidence for these measures, which can be implemented at a low cost, is urgently required. Many health programs in developing countries depend on financial support from donors. Influenza had little donor interest before the current avian influenza outbreaks. More donor funds are available for avian and pandemic influenza. These funds are often earmarked for specific activities. However, a more general approach is required to improve pandemic preparedness in developing countries. Improving pandemic preparedness without establishing a proper national program for seasonal influenza is unrealistic. For example, increasing the availability of pandemic vaccines without increasing the use of vaccines for seasonal influenza is difficult. It is also difficult to implement infection control measures in hospitals and personal hygiene during a pandemic if they are not routinely implemented for seasonal influenza and other infections.Lack of adequate infrastructure and technical expertise is a fundamental issue for developing countries, not only for influenza pandemic preparedness but also for any other infectious disease threats. Revised International Health Regulations (2005) were adopted at the World Health Assembly in 2005, under which each country is required to have core capacities for disease surveillance and response (36). Strengthening the core capacity in each country should be an essential step to improve preparedness for any public health emergency, including an influenza pandemic. Although some actions should be taken immediately to address urgent issues regarding a pandemic threat posed by influenza A (H5N1), a long-term vision is required to establish such core capacity in every country. ((ul))An influenza pandemic will spread to every corner of the world((/ul)); hence, every country must be prepared for such a global event. All human cases of infection with influenza A virus (H5N1) have so far occurred in less industrialized countries, and thus the pandemic virus is likely to emerge from these countries. Epidemiologic models have indicated the possibility of rapid containment of the virus with a pandemic potential (37,38). WHO has stockpiles of oseltamivir specifically for the early containment of a potential pandemic. However, the window of opportunity is narrow, and early containment operations should be initiated as soon as the initial sign of a potential pandemic is detected. Timely sharing of the virus strains and relevant information is essential for such containment to be successful.Sharing of the virus stains is also critical to develop pandemic vaccines. However, some countries do not share the virus strains with WHO reference laboratories. These countries argue that the virus strains from their countries would be used to develop pandemic vaccines that would only be available for rich countries (39). Developing countries have no incentives to share the virus strains if they do not benefit from the vaccines developed from these strains. The gaps in resources, including vaccine production capacity between the developing and industrialized countries, hinder the global effort to respond to a pandemic. Unequal distribution of resources, including antiviral stockpiles, could also be a major international issue when an influenza pandemic occurs. Countries with limited or no antiviral stockpiles and other resources may not be able to cope with the pandemic. ((ul))((hl))A pandemic poses a serious threat to global health security if large gaps in capacity and available resources continue to persist((/hl))((/ul)). Large numbers of people may attempt to cross international borders to obtain better medical care, including antiviral treatment, or to escape a chaotic situation. Preparing for a pandemic by simply strengthening preparedness within a single country is not possible. A pandemic is a global issue, and pandemic preparedness should be considered from a global perspective."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":64}},{"tag":"Doctors are leaving Syria now","cite":"Baker 14","text":["(Aryn Baker is reporter for Time and was correspondent for Middle East) Time “Syria’s Health Crisis Spirals as Doctors Flee” Published 2/4/14","http://time.com/3968/syrias-health-crisis-spirals-as-doctors-flee/ JP","It was the third week of an uprising in Syria that would eventually evolve into a brutal civil war and already the wounded were showing up at the hospital in the Damascus suburb where 29-year-old Ahmed was doing rotations during his medical residency. Ahmed, who asked that only one part of his name be published because he is afraid of repercussions from Syria’s security agencies, had only just started examining a young man with bruises and a deep puncture wound on his right side when two armed security officials burst into the examining room barking questions. Who was the patient, they wanted to know, and how did he get his injuries? When it emerged that the patient had been at a protest that afternoon against the government of Syrian President Bashar Assad the officials hauled the young man outside. Ahmed could do nothing. “I was so angry at myself,” he recalls, as he chain-smokes in a café in Lebanon nearly three years later. “Why didn’t I protect him? I was terrified. I was a coward.” That scene in Ahmed’s examining room would play out hundreds of more times across Syria as regime thugs hunted hospitals for wounded protestors, and then later, for rebels fighting against Assad’s government. When the rebel forces in Douma, the suburb where Ahmed’s hospital is located, grew in number and strength they then took to roaming the hospital corridors, seeking to finish off any regime supporters who had been injured in the vicious street fighting. In July 2012, the Syrian government passed an anti-terrorism law that effectively made it a crime to provide medical care to anyone suspected of supporting the rebels. Ahmed was caught between the Hippocratic oath — a doctor’s promise to treat every patient — and the growing pressure to take sides. “The regime said ‘Why are you helping the Free Army?’ and the Free Army said ‘Why are you helping the regime?’” Once a supporter of the revolution, Ahmed has come to the conclusion that neither side will be able to save Syria. So he is giving up, abandoning his “patient”— Syria— once again, he says with a wry smile. Instead, he has opted for a life in the United States; relatives already there are helping him to emigrate. “Yes, maybe I feel guilty,” he admits. “Maybe I am a coward for leaving Syria. But as a doctor it is impossible to work there. I have to live, I have to eat((hl)).” ((/hl))((ul))((hl))Ahmed is one of an estimated 15,000 doctors who have fled Syria over the past three years((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), according to a ((/ul))((ul))report released Feb. 2 by Physicians For Human Rights((/ul))((ul)) [PHR], ((/ul))((ul))((hl))representing half of the certified physicians in a country whose medical system was once the envy of the Arab world. The doctors who have fled have left behind a horrifying medical crisis.((/hl))((/ul)) According to the World Health Organization((ul)), more than half of Syrian hospitals have been destroyed or severely damaged. Syria’s largest city, Aleppo, once boasted 6,000 doctors. According to the PHR report, only 250 remained as of July 2013, serving a population of 2,500,000. In the Damascus suburbs where Ahmed worked, a pre-war population of 1,000 doctors had been cut down to 30 by December((/ul)), according to the PHR report. Nurses, technicians, ambulance drivers and medical support personnel have been forced to abandon their posts, the report says, unable to provide care in destroyed hospitals and clinics where supplies of life-giving medicine have run out. Even if the war were to end tomorrow, its medical legacy will last a generation. The U.N. estimates that more than half a million Syrians have suffered debilitating injuries that will require long-term care. Outbreaks of communicable disease are on the rise. Manageable chronic conditions, such as diabetes, kidney failure and heart disease, are escalating into life-threatening illnesses. When the war ends, Syria will need more physicians than ever before. Yet the likelihood of doctors returning from exile is slim. The longer the war lasts, the harder it will be for them to give up their new lives. The medical staff who have fled Ahmed’s hospital have settled in France, Germany, Dubai and Saudi Arabia. Some have lucrative contracts with local hospitals; others have set up private clinics. Many are going through the arduous process of getting recertified so they can work in the United States and Europe. “((ul))((hl))Most doctors will not go back after the crisis((/hl))((/ul)),” says Dr. Zaher Sahloul, a Chicago-based pulmonologist and head of the Syrian American Medical Society, an organization that raises funds to provide salaries and supplies to doctors still working in Syria. “Once you set up a new practice in a safe country it is a difficult decision to go back, especially since the economic situation will be so bad.” He says that around ((ul))((hl))1,000 to 1,200 Syrian doctors are already in the process of resettling in the U.S since the conflict started.((/hl))((/ul)) Though not all will continue in the medical field, it is a significant addition to the 7,000 Syrian doctors who were already in the U.S. prior to the war’s start. “It’s a huge brain drain,” Sahloul says. “I am not sure the Syrian medical system can recover from this.” ((ul))((hl))The shortage of doctors is taking an immense toll. Based on an assessment of mortality rates, hospital intake numbers, population and treatment rates for manageable diseases prior to the war((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), Sahloul estimates that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))some 200,000 people have died in Syria because they did not have access to routine medical care((/hl))((/ul)), what he calls a “secondary death toll” that is even higher than those killed by bombs and firearms. “These are the women who died in labor because there was no one to do a C-section, or the men who have a heart attack and can’t find a physician, or have complications from diabetes. People are dying of chronic diseases that three years ago would have been completely manageable.” The PHR report has found that 70,000 cancer patients and 5,000 dialysis patients have not been able to receive treatment. Oncologist Michel Abdallah fled for Jordan last year, and is now treating refugees as an employee of an aid group. The situation in Syria, he says, “is really bad. There are situations where a dermatologist might play the role of a dentist or a surgeon. We are losing patients who could have easily survived in normal circumstances. That’s not easy to come to terms with.”As Syria suffers, the American health system may benefit. Many Syrian doctors finished their advanced studies in the U.S. and are already licensed to work there. The U.S., with its high salaries and advanced medical care, has long been a magnet for doctors around the globe. Ahmed isn’t sure yet what he will do once he arrives in the U.S. After three years of war, he says he is tired of blood. “Real estate might be nice,” he muses. Still, he is hedging his bets. Unlike many doctors who fled, Ahmed is applying for official leave from his employer, the Syrian Ministry of Health. He hasn’t told them he is leaving the country, only that he is opening a private clinic. That way, if he does come back, he won’t be penalized. Sahloul thinks it’s unlikely that someone like Ahmed will ever return. That’s why, he says, it is so important to persuade the doctors still in Syria to stay. But he admits it’s a losing battle. “Doctors there not only have to deal with patients and disease, but politics and fighting groups and security. I can see why they are fleeing, but for the sake of Syria’s future, I wish they would stay.”"],"stats":{"highlightedWords":124}},{"tag":"Absence of Doctors leads to Chaos – Health system in Disarray","cite":"Phillips 16","text":["https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/fikraforum/view/syrias-compounding-healthcare-crisis JP","(Steven Phillips MD is a research scientist) The Washington Institute “Syria’s compounding  Health Care Crisis","A country’s optimal health care infrastructure comprises state of the art facilities staffed by well-trained providers with access to authoritative and current health science information. Prior to the civil war, the Syrian Arab Republic was close to this goal; it had five functioning medical schools, a National Health and Medication Plan, and thirty-seven medical libraries. During the decades preceding the Syrian civil war, access to and delivery of healthcare and healthcare information had steadily improved. According to the World Health organization, the life expectancy of the average Syrian in 2012 was 75.7 years, a leap from an average of 56 years in 1970. Pre-conflict health indicators amassed by the Syrian International Coalition for Health in 2012 noted substantial reductions in the death rate from all causes. The civil war has reversed this trend; ((ul))average life expectancy has fallen twenty years from the 2012 level. The United Nations now estimates that 12.2 million Syrians—including approximately six million children—require urgent humanitarian assistance((/ul)). Understanding the on-the-ground medical realities of the Syrian conflict, and how they differ from previous conflicts, is vital for both effective allocation of United States and international resources, and the development of medical plans for the days after the civil war.Throughout the history of modern conflicts, combatants have generally recognized medical personnel and facilities as non-combatants and spared them from attack. The Geneva Convention explicitly states that both military and civilian medical personnel exclusively assigned to medical duties must be respected and protected in all circumstances. Consequently, intentionally directing attacks against identifiable medical personnel and facilities constitutes a war crime.My personal experience in Vietnam supports the idea that the Geneva Convention Rules were, by and large, followed even in intense modern warfare scenarios. The Viet Cong and North Vietnamese regulars avoided attacking adequately identified medical facilities, probably due to United States’ military hospitals’ routine treatment for wounded enemy combatants. In 1968, while serving with the 101st Airborne, my medics and I were delivering a medical civic action program (MEDCAP) in a remote village. As dusk approached, the village chief told me a Viet Cong platoon was approaching and requested we leave immediately as the platoon did not want to harm a MEDCAP team. Though we feared an ambushed, we left the village unharmed. On another occasion my medical platoon was assigned to help re-open the civilian hospital in Hue City, which had been devastated by the TET offensive. There, we treated the general civilian population that undoubtedly included many enemies and enemy sympathizers. Our proper identification ensured that we were never harmed or even threatened during that three-month assignment.The Syrian conflict stands in sharp contrast to this model of healthcare during modern warfare. ((ul))((hl))The Syrian healthcare system, public health infrastructure, and health information resources have been devastated by the ongoing civil war, especially in rebel held areas.((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) Health care personnel, health care facilities, ambulances, manufacturers and suppliers of medical equipment and pharmaceuticals, including NGOs such as Doctors Without Borders, have been purposely and aggressively targeted on multiple fronts, primarily by the Syrian governmen((/ul))t. The Syrian government, which controls the skies, is responsible for 88 percent of recorded hospital attacks and 97 percent of medical personnel killed, with 139 deaths directly attributed to torture or execution. Rebel forces and ISIL have also been accused of targeting the health sector. In total, there have been 233 deliberate or indiscriminate attacks on 183 medical facilities. Russia’s entrance into the air campaign has dramatically increased hospital and clinic bombings. In October 2015, the first full month of Russian involvement, twelve medical facilities were purposely targeted and bombed. Early in 2016, Russian bombs targeted three hospitals, killing many and depriving thousands of Syrians access to care. ((ul))The effects of these bombings have cumulated into a national health crisis. According to the World Health Organization, approximately two-thirds of Syrian hospitals and clinics have been rendered useless or destroyed by the war. Remaining medical facilities are understaffed, poorly equipped, undersupplied, and overwhelmed with trauma care. Restrictions on travel and sanctions have resulted in drug, medical supplies, and equipment shortages((/ul)). With a shattered infrastructure, both doctors and patients have suffered tremendously. Nearly 700 healthcare workers have been killed or injured, and a full half of the country’s physicians have been forced to flee the country. More than one million Syrians have been wounded or killed, leaving hundreds of thousands with poorly managed chronic disabilities and a tragic lack of access to basic medical services. Deaths from treatable diseases and wounds have skyrocketed. Aside from combat-related challenges, treatments for chronic cardiovascular and renal diseases, cancer, diabetes, and non-urgent routine medical interventions are severely interrupted. “Elective” follow-up care for wounds, amputee prosthetics, infections, and other conditions can no longer be a priority and rarely receive attention. ((ul))((hl))The large-scale displacement of the Syrian population, unsanitary conditions, and contaminated water supply is fueling a resurgence of once-extinct communicable diseases: polio, cholera, typhoid, hepatitis, and parasitic infections((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). The mental trauma inflicted by this nearly six-year long civil war on the civilian population is incalculable.((/ul))The Syrian American Medical Society has been actively facilitating the rotation health care volunteers in Syria, but its doctors -- Dr. Samer Atar among them -- are chronicling the horrors of the field and the severe inadequacies of the medical situation that has led to the loss of many savable lives.Healthcare professionals are in many ways at a loss as to how the situation can be alleviated. Leonard Rubinstein, Director at the Bloomberg Center for Public Health and Human Rights at Johns Hopkins University, noted that the situation in Syria “is the worst concerted attack on healthcare in living memory… in places like Bosnia, Chechnya, Afghanistan, and the Gaza Strip, there has been nothing like what has happened in Syria.”The United States has provided more than $6.5 billion in humanitarian aid since the start of the crisis. This financial effort supports the operations of the United Nations and NGOs to provide emergency relief to Syria and its neighbors, which have been overwhelmed with the burdens of refugee assistance and have periodically closed their borders due to terrorist attacks. Closed borders prevent international medical humanitarian organizations like Doctors Without Borders from treating wounded Syrians. Though unconfirmed, it is reported that the Israeli army has set up a field hospital along the Syrian border on the Golan Heights to treat wounded Syrians.Though it is obvious that the Syrian crisis will not end soon, it is important to start thinking about the major international efforts that will be required to rebuild their public health and health care infrastructure. The Syrian medical community and supporting NGOs will have to shift from a crisis response mode to a strategic planning and recovery mode. The health sector that will be assembled to support this effort will require strong command and control to coordinate efforts, prioritize activities, and develop communication protocols that can accommodate an international task force. Critically important to this effort is the use of real time, open and free access to health information provided by the US National Library of Medicines (NLM) Disaster Information Management Research Center.Throughout the history of warfare, the medical respondents, both military and civilian, have intentionally been spared from attack. Even during the intense combat of World War I and World War II, periodic truces had been called to allow medical teams to evacuate and treat the injured; not so in Syria. The Syrian government has purposefully and intentionally targeted their own medical infrastructure, including humanitarian volunteer teams. ((ul))This violation of the Geneva Convention has resulted in the nearly complete destruction of a preconflict, modern Syrian health care system. The rebuilding of their devastated health structure will require a herculean effort by the international community, which should commit itself to decades of work.((/ul))"],"stats":{"highlightedWords":52}},{"tag":"Health care systems under attack in Syria.

((ul))((hl))We also((/hl))((/ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((ul))((hl))face the specter of novel and mutated pathogens that could spread and kill faster than diseases we have seen before((/hl))((/ul)). With the advent of genome-editing technologies, bioterrorists could artificially engineer new plagues, a threat that Ashton Carter, the former U.S. secretary of defense, thinks could ((ul))((hl))rival nuclear weapons in deadliness((/hl))((/ul)). The two of us have advised the president of Guinea on stopping Ebola. In addition, we have worked on ways to contain the spread of Zika and have informally advised U.S. and international organizations on the matter. ((ul))Our experiences tell us that the world is unprepared for these threats((/ul)). We urgently need to change this trajectory. We can start by learning four lessons from the gaps exposed by the Ebola and Zika pandemics. Faster Vaccine Development The most effective way to stop pandemics is with vaccines. However, with Ebola there was no vaccine, and only now, years later, has one proven effective. This has been the case with Zika, too. Though there has been rapid progress in developing and getting a vaccine to market, it is not fast enough, and Zika has already spread worldwide. Many other diseases do not have vaccines, and developing them takes too long when a pandemic is already under way. We need faster pipelines, such as the one that the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations is trying to create, to preemptively develop vaccines for diseases predicted to cause outbreaks in the near future. Poinkt-of-Care Diagnostics Even with such efforts, vaccines will not be ready for many diseases and would not even be an option for novel or artificially engineered pathogens. With no vaccine for Ebola, our next best strategy was to identify who was infected as quickly as possible and isolate them before they infected others. Because Ebola’s symptoms were identical to common illnesses like malaria, diagnosis required laboratory testing that could not be easily scaled. As a result, many patients were only tested after several days of being contagious and infecting others. Some were never tested at all, and about 40% of patients in Ebola treatment centers did not actually have Ebola. Many dangerous pathogens similarly require laboratory testing that is difficult to scale. Florida, for example, has not been able to expand testing for Zika, so pregnant women wait weeks to know if their babies might be affected. What’s needed are point-of-care diagnostics that, like pregnancy tests, can be used by frontline responders or patients themselves to detect infection right away, where they live. These tests already exist for many diseases, and the technology behind them is well-established. However, the process for their validation is slow and messy. Point-of-care diagnostics for Ebola, for example, were available but never used because of such bottlenecks. Greater Global Coordination ((ul))We need stronger global coordination((/ul)). The ((ul))responsibility for controlling pandemics is ((/ul))((ul))fragmented, spread across too many players with no unifying authority((/ul)). In Guinea we forged a response out of an amalgam of over 30 organizations, each of which had its own priorities. ((ul))In Ebola’s aftermath, there have been calls for a mechanism for responding to pandemics similar to the advance planning and training that NATO has in place for its numerous members to respond to military threats in a quick, coordinated fashion((/ul)). This is the right thinking, but we are far from seeing it happen. The errors that allowed Ebola to become a crisis replayed with Zika, and the ((ul))WHO, which should anchor global action, continues to suffer from a lack of credibility((/ul)). Stronger Local Health Systems ((ul))((hl))International actors are essential but ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))cannot parachute into countries and navigate local dynamics quickly enough to contain outbreaks((/hl))((/ul)). In Guinea it took months to establish the ground game needed to stop the pandemic, with Ebola continuing to spread in the meantime. We need to help developing countries establish health systems that can provide routine care and, when needed, coordinate with international responders to contain new outbreaks. Local health systems could be established for about half of the $3.6 billion ultimately spent on creating an Ebola response from scratch. ((ul))((hl))Access to ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))routine care((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) is also ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))essential((/hl))((/ul)) for knowing when an outbreak is taking root and establishing trust. For months, Ebola spread before anyone knew it was happening, and then lingered because communities who had never had basic health care doubted the intentions of foreigners flooding into their villages. The turning point in the pandemic came when they began to trust what they were hearing about Ebola and understood what they needed to do to halt its spread: identify those exposed and safely bury the dead. ((ul))With Ebola and Zika, we lacked((/ul)) these four things — vaccines, diagnostics, ((ul))global coordination, and local health systems — which are still urgently needed((/ul)). However, prevailing political headwinds in ((ul))the United States((/ul)), which ((ul))has played a ((/ul))((ul))key role in combatting pandemics around the world((/ul)), threaten to make things worse. The Trump administration is seeking drastic budget cuts in funding for foreign aid and scientific research. The U.S. State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development may lose over one-third of their budgets, including half of the funding the U.S. usually provides to the UN. The National Institutes of Health, which has been on the vanguard of vaccines and diagnostics research, may also face cuts. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has been at the forefront of responding to outbreaks, remains without a director, and, if the Affordable Care Act is repealed, would lose $891 million, 12% of its overall budget, provided to it for immunization programs, monitoring and responding to outbreaks, and other public health initiatives. ((ul))Investing in our ability to prevent and contain pandemics through ((/ul))((ul))revitalized national((/ul)) and international ((ul))institutions((/ul)) ((ul))should be our((/ul)) shared ((ul))goal((/ul)). However, if U.S. agencies become less able to respond to pandemics, leading institutions from other nations, such as Institut Pasteur and the National Institute of Health and Medical Research in France, the Wellcome Trust and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in the UK, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs have done instrumental research and response work in previous pandemics), would need to step in to fill the void. There is no border wall against disease. ((ul))((hl))Pandemics are an existential threat on par with climate change and nuclear conflict((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).((/hl)) We are at a critical crossroads, where we must either take the steps needed to prepare for this threat or become even more vulnerable.

It had been making the rounds among birds in Southeast Asia for years. An outbreak in 1997 Hong Kong and another in 2003 each called for the culling of thousands of birds and put virologists and health workers into a tizzy. Although the virus wasn't much of a threat to humans, scientists fretted over the possibility of a horrifying pandemic. Relatively few people caught the virus, but more than half of them died. What would happen if this bird flu virus made the jump to humans? What if it mutated in a way that allowed it to spread from one person to another, through tiny droplets of saliva in the air?

Durham theses, Durham University. Available at Durham E-Theses Online: http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/1898/","Despite the ubiquitous nature of photographic images, their pervasive influence may be hard to pin down. In a sceptical analysis, David ((ul))((hl))Perlmutter((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))(1998) ((ul))((hl))questions((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) the logic of ((/ul))((ul))((hl))'visual determinism'((/hl))((/ul)), ((ul))((hl))which argues for the role of images in policy decisions((/hl))((/ul)) - ((ul))the so-called 'CNN effect'((/ul)) which draws elected officials to the television set as they evaluate their ever-changing position in the public eye. According to Perlmutter, icons are selected and confirmed by a small section of society he calls 'discourse elites' - politicians, academics, and workers in the media. Because such privileged professionals work daily with images, control them, study them in broadsheet newspapers and believe in their effects, they tend to assume that the general public does likewise, often overestimating the familiarity of even the most famous images to the untrained or uninterested viewer. Choosing specific examples including Adams' image of General Loan in Tet and other'icons of outrage', ((ul))he argues that((/ul)) ((ul))((hl))the measurable effect of((/hl))((/ul)) visual ((ul))((hl))images is small and they do not ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))usually((/ul))((ul))((hl)) overturn policy((/hl))((/ul)), although, by contrast, some examples of decisions influenced by images are given in Taylor (1998: 136). So, ((ul))while ((/ul))((ul))((hl))many((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) blamed photographs ((/ul))like those made by Adams ((ul))for influencing public opinion in the United States against the war in Vietnam((/ul)), ((ul))Perlmutter argues for the reverse: that because public opinion was already turning against the war, it seized on the image ((/ul))of Loan as a confirmation of its new values. ((ul))Perlmutter's ((/ul))((ul))((hl))warn((/hl))((/ul))((ul))ing ((/ul))((ul))((hl))against((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) an ((/ul))exaggerated or ((ul))((hl))naive trust in the power of((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))image((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) is important, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))and((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) he is correct in stating that an((/ul)) ((ul))objective ((/ul))((ul))((hl))measurement of((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) the((/ul))((ul))((hl)) influence of images ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))on policy decisions((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) is hard to find((/hl))((/ul)). Nevertheless, his analysis does not preclude a more general awareness of certain regularly circulated photographs in society, and influence may also have more general effects than government policy decisions. Accordingly, Hariman and Lucaites (2001: 19) believe that, 'visual practices have long been important yet undervalued constituents of democratic culture precisely because they are media for emotional representation that lead to performative identification rather than rational deliberation'. I would concur that the value accorded to written documents and the official archive of materials is often denied the photographic image which, nevertheless, is so regularly witnessed that its pull on the emotions should not be dismissed. 5 Alongside his scepticism about the influence of photographs, ((ul))another side of Perimutter's critique is based on the premise that the term icon is sometimes used rather loosely to refer to group of images of important events rather than the single famous image itself.((/ul)) Icons of significant events may circulate widely, in the process losing captions and credits detailing the specificities of their making and becoming instead generalised symbols (Zelizer 1998: 98ý 121). ((ul))((hl))Perlmutter((/hl))((/ul)) distinguishes between the discrete icons, the unique image (even though there may be many millions of copies of this image) and the generic icon. He ((ul))((hl))expands on one((/hl))((/ul)) obvious ((ul))((hl))example, that of images of starving((/hl))((/ul)) African ((ul))((hl))children,((/hl))((/ul)) to explain that there is no one photograph of malnourished children that sticks in the public memory, but rather it is a generic concept that is pulled out every time a famine appears in the news media. He explains, 'certain elements are repeated over and over, from image to image, so that varying subjects, times, and locations, the basic scene becomes a familiar staple, a visual cliche' (1998: 11).

This may lead to an inattention to the specificities of each situation, and tends not to focus blame on the possible causes of, in this case, the ((ul))((hl))famine. Discussion of((/hl))((/ul)) multiple ((ul))((hl))images often leads to((/hl))((/ul)) questions about the possible negative effects of visual imagery, often expressed as compassion fatigue (as 6 for example in the title of Susan Moeller's 1999 work on the subject). Does repeated viewing anaesthetise the viewer against further feelings of shock, outrage and pity on seeing images of horror or pain? Perlmutter (1998: 81) speculates that 'icons of outrage' may lead not to moves to right the wrongs depicted, but to a weakened 'compassionspeak' that is merely a language of description rather than action. John Taylor (1998) refrains from blaming the media for compassion fatigue but suggests that a proliferation of imagery alone will not insure society against forgetting traumatic events, even quite soon after their occurrence. In a perceptive examination, Carolyn Dean (2003) notes the ((ul))((hl))tendency to condemn graphic portrayals((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))of dead, injured and dying human beings as 'pornographic', implying that they present an eroticised view of pain and suffering which is morally reprehensible as well as hinting at a prior state of affairs in which the human suffering was treated more respectfully. The classic example of this is the Holocaust, long a subject of polemic over the possibility of its representation even while its key images, of skeletal survivors, do not cease to circulate. According to Dean, ((ul))((hl))however((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)), ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))the usefulness of such ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))blanket ((/ul))((ul))((hl))condemnations((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) of images((/ul)) of horror as eroticised and commodified ((ul))((hl))is limited.((/hl))((/ul)) Thus far, I have discussed the origins of icons in general terms, and picked up on the clearest examples of photographic iconicity. In a nutshell, key factors have been identified as the wide circulation of a select few images, their strong emotional pull, and possible religious connotations. I have also pinpointed the lack of attention to the regional which may prejudice the consideration of photographic icons. Where do these remarks take us when we return to Latin America, a region which, Che aside, has been largely absent from the canon of classic images? How do images interact with the issues of memory which, as discussed in the previous chapter, are crucial in post-conflict societies? In my own consideration of iconic images, I will draw on the theories outlined above. One concern, however, is that most examination of significant images has been from the viewpoint of the European or US-based observer. With few exceptions, most images were directed at principally European and North American audiences, and detailed analyses like those conducted by Perlmutter and Hariman and Lucaites are extremely valuable but focus specifically on the North American context, as well as neglecting issues of memory. While the work of Hariman and Lucaites (2007) is explicitly based firmly in the United States, it does cover famous images from Vietnam, Iwo Jima, and Tiananmen Square, but only insofar as they are viewed by and have an influence on an American audience, neglecting issues of their reception elsewhere. The relevance of their findings in Latin America must therefore be evaluated carefully, in part because there is not such widespread access in the region to television, print media and the internet. While there is a small group of images whose fame has reached internationally, each country also has iconic images that are recognised in a national context but may not be well known beyond its borders. It is beyond the scope of this thesis to provide a definitive framework for iconicity in as diverse a region as Latin America, but in my juxtaposition of Peru and Argentina and their points of convergence and divergence, I aim to draw some conclusions about the significance of the icon in the commemoration of violence in Argentina and Peru. Moreover, while each Latin American nation has a specific history and culture, many of them share issues of postdictatorial development, and this project is thus a step towards an evaluation of memory images in the subcontinent. Firstly I would concur, with Hariman and Lucaites, that the right conditions come together to create an iconic image. A composition that is familiar and recognisable to the viewing audience, perhaps involving religious connotations; an emotional appeal and a relatively clear cut moral message all contribute to the strength of the image. Perlmutter (1998) adds another important factor: metonymy. The image must have the ability to stand in for the whole situation it represents: one starving child for the plight of millions in Africa, one heap of skeletal bodies for all Holocaust victims, and so on. It must also appear at an opportune moment and with the ability to be reproduced on multiple occasions, leaving room for an element of chance and the influence of the media and publishing industries. In fact, as will be examined in depth in chapter three of this thesis, Runia (2006) emphasises the significance of metonymy in memory debates, in which iconic images, sites, and people are made to stand in for a whole historical period. The ease with which photographs circulate, often unaccredited, and the ability to assimilate them in many different ways means that they often escape closer scrutiny.

This phenomenon results in significant socioeconomic consequences as a result of the continuous loss of practitioners and trainees as well as losing their social value and financial support to their country of origin. Many countries suffered from brain drain to variable extents particularly during the second half of the 20th century, following World War II. In contrast, many countries have markedly gained form this movement leading to remarkable development of their economy and educational systems due to the significant contributions made by the immigrating professionals to their respective fields. ((ul))((hl))Physicians’ brain drain had a substantial burden on developing countries over the past few decades due to the significant loss of medical professionals and health care providers in both clinical care and medical education fields((/hl))((/ul)). For example, the number of international medical graduates (IMGs) in the United States is estimated at 245,000 according the American Medical Association (AMA) statistics in 2007, representing an approximately 25% of the entire health workforce in the nation[1,2] where physicians immigrating from lower income countries constitute 60% of all practicing IMGs. India occupies the first rank among the source countries of IMGs in the United States with an emigration factor of 10.6%. (Emigration factor is defined as the number of physicians from a source nation practicing in a recipient country divided by the total number of physicians practicing in the source country.)[1,2] This is followed by a number of countries such as Philippines, Pakistan, and some Latin America and Middle East countries such as Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon.[1,2] ((ul))Between 2004 and 2008, the data from the AMA records indicated that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the total numbers of Syrian physicians practicing in the United States has increased((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) from approximately 3200 to 3900 representing 0.4% of the health workforce and 1.6% of IMGs((/ul)).[1,2] The Global Health Observatory data repository reported that ((ul))the total number of physicians in Syria was estimated at 31,000, according to the 2008 statistics, with an approximately 15 physicians per 10,000 capita.[((/ul))((ul))3((/ul))((ul))] This renders the emigration factor of Syrian physicians to the United States to be around 13%. A study published in((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))Health Policy((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))in 2007 analyzed the dynamics of international immigration patterns of physicians to the United States and found that Syria has a higher-than-expected physicians immigration rates((/ul)).[4] In fact, Syria was the sixth country among the top eight countries which have a higher-than-expected rate and the second Arab country after Lebanon when adjusting for the population size.[4,5] Recently, the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG) indicated in its 2010 annual report that a total of 140 certificates were issued to medical students who graduated from Syrian medical schools representing 1.5% of the total certificates issued in 2010. Also, a total of 240 exchange visiting student visas were issued for Syrian medical graduates in the 2009–2010 academic year.[6] ((ul))((hl))Major factors contribute to this trend on physicians’ immigration from Syria including the large differences in incomes and standards of living, the scarcity and instability of professional and academic opportunities, and the “culture of emigration” among physicians in training((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). The majority of the recipient countries provide a proper professional atmosphere, better academic freedom, and flexibility with much better overall living conditions.((/ul)) Unfortunately, some of these factors are difficult to counteract in a short-term intervention. Nevertheless, several measures can be done to increase the retention of practicing and graduating physicians or minimize the effect of brain drain on the health and medical education systems. Core modifications in health and education policy and professional atmosphere are essential to achieve broad societal changes and to reduce the rates of physicians’ emigration. Providing better academic and professional opportunities, allowing more flexibility to the health and education systems, promoting research and its infrastructure, establishing networks between professionals inside and outside the country, as well as encouraging the return of the emigrant physicians will minimize the effects of physicians’ brain drain which will ultimately improve the overall rating of the Syrian health and medical education systems."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":87}},{"tag":"The United States Federal Government should increase its humanitarian aid and foreign development budgets. \nIncreasing the budget solves security and humanitarian crises","cite":"NRC 17","text":["3-16-17 Norwegian Refugee Council. “US foreign aid cuts threaten lives in world’s poorest countries” https://reliefweb.int/report/world/us-foreign-aid-cuts-threaten-lives-world-s-poorest-countries","((ul))The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) is alarmed by US President Donald Trump’s announcement today of his administration’s intention to cut the international affairs budget, which includes humanitarian aid, development and diplomacy, by US$10.1 billion or 28 per cent, to bolster a $54 billion hike in military spending.((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))“((/ul))((ul))((hl))The question is not if human lives will be lost as a result of ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))President ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Trump’s decision to slash spending on foreign aid and diplomacy; the question is how many and how soon((/hl))((/ul)),” warned Joel Charny, NRC’s Director in the United States. “((ul))Today, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))over 65 million people are on the move, forced from their homes((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) by war and persecution.

It’s inhumane to make unprecedented cuts to aid like this, at a time when we are struggling to respond to multiple humanitarian crises((/ul)).” The United States is the largest humanitarian donor in the world. In 2016 alone, it provided $6.4 billion for emergencies - about a third of the overall $22.1 billion spent globally by aid agencies. This included distributing lifesaving food in South Sudan, preventing HIV/AIDS in Nigeria and rebuilding Afghanistan’s education system so children can return to school.

The Trump budget proposal states that it retains “significant funding for humanitarian assistance,” although it does not provide a detailed breakdown of specific accounts.

Over one-quarter of Lebanon’s population and one-fifth of Jordan’s population is made up of refugees. Somalia and Yemen, countries torn apart by civil war and struck by famine, have two of the largest internally-displaced populations in the world. In the midst of these humanitarian crises, the U.S. has shirked its responsibilities, declaring the lowest refugee admissions ceiling since the modern refugee resettlement program began in the early 1980s and ignoring the importance of funding for humanitarian programs abroad. ((ul))In February 2018, President Trump issued his budget for Fiscal Year 2019 (FY19), titled “An American Budget.” While this budget is merely the starting point for negotiations on the hill, it is the best indication we have of what the President and his administration prioritize. ((/ul))“An American Budget” slashes funding for the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) by $9 billion, a 26% decrease from 2017 funding levels. To put this number in perspective, foreign aid, historically, has only accounted for less than 1% of the U.S. budget. These budget cuts will have an immediate and detrimental impact on refugees in the U.S. and displaced and in-need populations overseas around the world. ((ul))((hl))At a time when millions are displaced due to civil war, violence, ethnic cleansing, and natural disasters, this is the time for the U.S. to sustain, if not step up, its international commitments((/hl))((/ul)). Here are four ways that humanitarian aid is implicitly linked to the global refugee crisis: ((ul))1) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Our humanitarian aid budget designates funds which directly impact refugees and displaced persons not in the U.S.((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))The Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA) Program, administered by the Department of State, covers aid to refugees and internally displaced persons. The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), which provides protection, shelter, water, health care, and other resources to refugees and internally displaced persons, relies heavily on this account((/ul)). The U.S., the world’s most powerful economy, is the UNHCR’s largest donor by far, giving almost $1.5 billion to the refugee agency; over three times that of Germany, the UNHCR’s second largest donor. U.S. funding supports programs and institutions which prevent refugees from being forcibly returned to places where their lives would be threatened, works to ensure access for humanitarian agencies to conflict zones, promotes international humanitarian and human rights law, and de-escalates conflicts which engender human displacement. ((ul))2) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Humanitarian aid also includes significant funding for the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program.((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))Since its inception under President Reagan in the early 1980s, the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) has taken in more refugees than any other country’s resettlement program. At times of far less need, the U.S. has done much more to address human displacement. In 1980, there were about 9 million displaced people in the world. That year, the U.S. took in 207,116 refugees. This year, as more than 65 million people are displaced around the world, the U.S. has agreed to take in only 45,000 refugees.((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))The U.S. sets an example for other countries: when the U.S. resettles refugees, other countries follow suit. This pattern, however, goes both ways; when the U.S. closes its doors to displaced persons, other countries do as well. The USRAP has historically had a strong bipartisan tradition. Opening our doors to those fleeing persecution is grounded in our country’s very founding. From its earliest years, U.S shores have represented refuge and new beginnings for those seeking safety. Resettlement is often the only option for refugees when voluntary repatriation — return to their home country — and local integration to the country they initially fled are not possible. It is critical that the USRAP continues to receive funding to work in partnership with the UNHCR, bring refugees to the U.S., and to support refugee resettlement agencies in the U.S. ((ul))3) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Aid goes to countries which are facing unanticipated humanitarian crises; crises which are typically refugee producing((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))Under the Department of State, the Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance (ERMA) fund is a critically important account for the global refugee crisis. ERMA is a flexible reserve fund and allows the U.S. to support unforeseen humanitarian needs without taking money away from other humanitarian priorities. In past years, the ERMA fund was drawn on to offer aid to those affected by civil unrest in Libya, support those fleeing Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and provide assistance to Syrian refugees in Jordan, Turkey, and Lebanon. If history teaches us anything, it is that we cannot predict every humanitarian crisis that arises. The least we can do is be prepared to meet these crises.((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))4) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Aid goes to those countries which are disproportionately shouldering the burden of the refugee crisis.((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))The U.S. would have to resettle about 3,750 refugees each month to resettle the embarrassingly low number of 45,000 refugees the President determined the U.S. could resettle this fiscal year. Halfway through FY18, the U.S. is not on track to resettle even half that number this year. Meanwhile, countries like Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon, Kenya, and Ethiopia host large numbers of refugees, disproportionate to their populations and resources. More and more, refugees are living in towns and cities. According to the UNHCR, two-thirds of refugees now live outside of camps. Host governments are scrambling to find resources to expand housing availability, improve infrastructure, and offer educational and vocational opportunities to refugees. The MRA fund, in conjunction with USAID, addresses the development issues host countries face from protracted, refugee-producing conflicts. ((/ul))These funds recognize the new reality that refugees are likely to be displaced from their homes for generations and must build their lives in a new country. If host countries cannot adequately support their refugee populations, the escalation of economic, social, and political instability is inevitable. Thus, it is critical from both a moral and national security standpoint that the U.S. maintain its international commitments to support these countries.

What happened in between—and ultimately over the past two decades—is part of an important storyline of the politics not just of foreign assistance, but of America’s global leadership. LESSONS FROM THE MARSHALL PLAN Stories of U.S. foreign aid are rarely told without a mention of U.S. Secretary of State George Marshall, considered the father of foreign assistance with the Marshall Plan. Yet the political acumen of this retired general—who served as both secretary of state and secretary of defense—is often underappreciated. As we recently marked the 70th anniversary of the plan’s announcement, few may remember that, despite its overwhelming success, the initial proposal was wildly unpopular and feverishly opposed by the Senate Majority Leader Robert Taft of Ohio and a war-weary America seeking to benefit from the peace dividend. Marshall and Secretary of Commerce Averell Harriman made it their personal mission to earn the public’s support. Without the benefit of social media, they traveled around the country for months, speaking to everyone from Rotary clubs to chambers of commerce about both the “nobleness” of the plan, but also why it was in America’s self-interest to rebuild a more stable Europe that would be a future market for American goods and a partner for peace. Recognizing the uphill battle, the State Department even established a bipartisan citizen’s commission—comprised of prominent businessmen, industrialists, academics, ambassadors, and clergy—charged with embarking on a nationwide public relations campaign. While early Gallup polls showed that more than 50 percent of Americans opposed the program, the plan eventually passed overwhelmingly in Congress. Not only was the Marshall Plan unpopular, it also suffered from two tough labels—namely “foreign” and “aid.” Yet with strong political leadership, an engaged cadre of credible messengers, and a clear message about how the policy impacted voters’ interests, the outcome was successful. Seventy years later, these political lessons still ring true. THE COLD WAR POLITICS OF FOREIGN AID ((ul))During the Cold War, American support for robust engagement in the world held steady, with polls showing that a vast majority of Americans supported overseas programs like famine relief.((/ul)) Unfortunately, this was the same era when negative stereotypes arose—a reminder of past aid to authoritarian rulers who were nominally allies against the Soviet Union. ((ul))Interestingly, as the Cold War came to an end, it was President Ronald Reagan whose “peace through strength” foreign policy platform fostered strong support for foreign assistance among conservatives.((/ul)) While Reagan may be best known for his military buildup, he recognized that “the ultimate importance to the United States of our security and development assistance programs cannot be exaggerated.” Under his leadership in 1985, the U.S. spent close to 0.6 percent of the nation’s GDP on civilian international affairs programs—the high water mark for foreign assistance spending since the Marshall Plan. THE PRE-9/11 ERA AND THE ISOLATIONIST WINDS ((ul))By the mid-1990s, policymakers were eager to reap a “peace dividend” after the end of the Cold War. As isolationist winds were blowing through Washington, some members of Congress openly stood on the floor of the House of Representatives and bragged that they did not own a passport.((/ul)) And the House Budget Resolution for Fiscal Year 1996 called for cutting more than 20 percent from the foreign assistance account, then totaling only $20 billion. In the Senate, Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, a self-avowed aid skeptic, proposed a radical shrinking of America’s footprint around the world—including the elimination of the U.S. Agency for International Development. ((ul))((hl))Between 1990 and 2000, foreign assistance spending declined by 20 percent((/hl))((/ul))((ul)),((/ul)) thousands of State Department and USAID positions were eliminated, and 70 USAID missions and diplomatic posts were shuttered. USAID was ultimately saved with the concession to eliminate the U.S. Information Agency. ((ul))((hl))The threats to foreign assistance and America’s global leadership during this time were a wake-up call.((/hl))((/ul)) With the exception of the pro-Israel community, led by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, there was no organized effort to educate, engage, and mobilize around foreign assistance on a national scale. While there were unique efforts on specific issues, no one had tried to engage the broad array of citizen voices who cared about America’s global engagement and could convey strong domestic support for global development and diplomacy. But soon this would change. THE POLITICAL TRANSFORMATION OF FOREIGN AID ((ul))During these tumultuous years, several important efforts were born. Through the late 1990s, the faith-based community led the wildly successful Jubilee 2000 campaign to secure debt relief for developing countries. And in the mid-2000s, Bono launched the ONE Campaign, creating a worldwide grassroots movement that, along with dozens of nongovernmental organizations, has had a critical impact in galvanizing voices in support of poverty-focused development aid.((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))In 1995, a broad-based coalition of “strange bedfellows”—eventually known as the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition (USGLC)—took a page out of Secretary Marshall’s playbook and began to transform the politics of foreign aid((/ul)). In the early years, the USGLC sought to counter the isolationist tides and stop the hemorrhaging of the international affairs account. ((ul))Today, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the USGLC works around the country building broad support for America’s global leadership((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), development, and diplomacy with a coalition of more than 500 businesses and NGOs; a bipartisan advisory council chaired by former Secretary of State Colin Powell that includes every living secretary of state; nearly 200 retired three- and four-star generals and admirals; and advocates in all 50 states.((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))While the community has weathered numerous efforts to scale back America’s civilian forces, the current proposals in Washington to slash the State Department and USAID by 32 percent present the most serious threat to America’s global leadership since the 1990s. And what many may not realize is that the historical and bipartisan groundswell of opposition that has unfolded over the past few months was actually years in the making. Here are some of the lessons learned from two decades changing the politics of foreign aid: ((ul))1.((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Messengers matter((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))While many forceful voices have advocated for foreign assistance over the years, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))top generals and admirals((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) have perhaps been the most powerful. These seemingly unexpected allies promoting the need for civilian power have been a game changer.((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))Years ago, General Anthony Zinni, a former Commander of the U.S. Central Command, helped launch a network of now nearly 200 three- and four-star military leaders with the likes of Generals David Petraeus and Michael Hagee, Admirals James Loy and James Stavridis, and many others. These battle-tested leaders have not only lent their names, but also testified to Congress, penned op-eds, and spoken out around the country. Their national security credibility has been unmatched. ((ul))Today, one of the most oft-cited quotes in support of our civilian forces is from then-General Jim Mattis who testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee in 2013: “If you don’t fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition.”((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))2.((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))Message matters((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))There is no silver bullet to ensure support from a policymaker, but what is clear is that members of Congress need the issue to be relevant back home. While lawmakers can believe that supporting America’s engagement overseas is the right thing to do, they also need the facts and figures to explain why it is the smart thing to do for our security and our economic interests. ((ul))On the frontlines of creating jobs and driving exports, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the voices of business leaders and state chambers of commerce have been centra((/hl))((/ul))((ul))l to capturing the attention of lawmakers around the country. The economic message combined with a security and values-driven agenda has proven highly effective((/ul)). A few samples of the three-pronged message: National security: “The military alone cannot keep us safe.” Jobs and the economy: “95 percent of consumers live outside the United States.” Moral leadership: “America is that shining city on the hill.” ((ul))3.((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))Leadership matters((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))As Secretary Marshall and President Harry Truman demonstrated, leadership matters. Few have showed this better on development assistance than President George W. Bush. As a candidate who ran on a platform against “nation building,” he went on to be one of the greatest champions for global health, helping to save more than 13 million lives by launching PEPFAR (the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) and the malaria relief program. His leadership in establishing the Millennium Challenge Corporation raised the bar for strengthening foreign assistance effectiveness. The Obama administration built upon these successes, deepening our investments in public- private partnerships, aid effectiveness, and transparency, and ensuring country commitments through presidential initiatives on food security and energy. The nominated USAID administrator, Ambassador Mark Green, is well known for his leadership on smart aid reform. Leadership on these issues also includes the legislative branch. ((ul))In the past two and a half years, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Congress passed eight significant pieces of bipartisan legislation on global development,((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ranging from food security to aid effectiveness to rights for women and girls, with sponsors from across the political spectrum.((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))4.((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))Local voices matter((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))A junior member of Congress from the Midwest made a name for himself on local talk radio prior to being elected with the common refrain: “Why should we be building schools over there, when we should be building schools here at home?” Yet after this Tea Party conservative visited a USAID agriculture program in Africa, he became a staunch believer and vocal advocate for the foreign assistance budget.((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))The congressman’s decision to go on this overseas education trip did not come from his staff, but instead from a top CEO from his state. As House Speaker Tip O’Neill once said, “All politics is local.”((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))In the past decade, the most consequential and lasting shifts in policymakers’ support for foreign assistance has come as the groundwork spread far outside the beltway. In the last election cycle alone, nearly 200 candidates met with foreign assistance advocates—groups of local business, faith, NGO, veteran, and community leaders—in their home districts. These meetings, led by highly influential supporters of foreign assistance, have been critical in both educating skeptics and reinforcing champions, showcasing the strength of constituent support for global development. ((ul))5.((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))Local platforms matter((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))Members of Congress not only need to hear this support, but they also need to feel it tangibly. A decade ago, the USGLC launched what has become a signature program—local statewide events that provide a platform for lawmakers to engage directly with their constituents on how America’s role in the world directly impacts their communities. Several years ago, the USGLC hosted an event for a newly elected senator in his home state. The room was packed with hundreds of his constituents. Just before he was introduced, the senator leaned over to me and said, “My constituents don’t like foreign assistance.” Once on stage, sandwiched between a prominent retired four-star general and a well-respected former diplomat, the senator found a different voice. With the political cover to his left and right, he started singing off of our song sheet, boldly telling the supportive crowd why aid was directly in America’s national security, economic, and humanitarian interests. Time and again, these ((ul))((hl))local programs have provided an opportunity for policymakers to speak out and the words spoken outside the beltway have translated into positives votes and action back in Washington. While isolationist winds may have returned to Washington in recent days, there are very different speeches being made on the House floor compared with two decades ago.((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) In fact, more than 200 members of Congress from the Freedom Caucus to the Progressive Caucus have gone on the record opposing the proposal to cut the State Department and USAID by a third.((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))There is no shortage of political challenges in the coming months and years. In addition to the proposed cuts, polls taken year after year still underscore the misinformation about the size of the small 1 percent of the federal budget that is dedicated to foreign assistance. Most surveys suggest that Americans believe aid accounts for more than a quarter of the federal budget, and polling in the Heartland showed deeper concerns just last year. ((ul))But what has changed is that the many voices in our society who understand the stakes of America’s global leadership and the value of foreign assistance are speaking up—educating, engaging, and mobilizing. Members of Congress are not naïve—they see the complexities of the world, from threats of pandemics to famine to terrorism. Yet sometimes they also need a political embrace and a “thank you” for their leadership. And it is clear that today there is a growing chorus of voices doing just that.((/ul))"],"stats":{"highlightedWords":154}},{"tag":"((hl))1) No impact - The US has exhausted its obligations to TPS recipients—they knew they were temporary when they accepted the protections((/hl))","cite":"((hl))Ira ((/hl))((hl))Mehlman((/hl)), media director at the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), 10/26/2017","text":["[“Temporary status for immigrants shouldn't mean permanent residency,”","http://thehill.com/opinion/immigration/357305-temporary-status-for-immigrants-shouldnt-mean-permanent-residency CBO DUDA]","Between now and Jan. 18, the deadlines for extending or terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for 90 percent of all foreign nationals who hold that status will elapse.

((ul))But, as previous immigration experiments demonstrate, the policy((/ul)) will not aid American workers. And it ((ul))certainly won’t make Salvadorans pack their bags((/ul)). Trump’s order is likely to have the opposite effects. President George W. Bush granted Salvadorans temporary protected status (TPS) after devastating earthquakes hit El Salvador in 2001. He and President Barack Obama repeatedly extended the status. Beyond its humanitarian impact, TPS provides significant economic benefits. It doesn’t give applicants access to any federal welfare — so there are few costs — but it does grant the legal right to work. And Salvadorans with TPS work at very high rates: Eighty-eight percent participate in the labor force, compared with 63 percent of all Americans. Legal employment has helped Salvadorans achieve a relatively high standard of living. The median household income for Salvadorans with TPS is $50,000, higher than the roughly $36,000 for unauthorized immigrants. Their higher wages, combined with the lack of public benefits, has been a big win for U.S. taxpayers. ((ul))((hl))Canceling TPS will make it illegal for these Salvadorans to work, but it’s unlikely to force them home. In 1990, President George H.W. Bush granted TPS to some ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))185,000((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) Salvadorans during the country’s civil war, and when President Bill Clinton canceled their status in 1996, ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))few((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) returned.

Trump can try to drive them out with immigration raids and increased deportations, as other presidents have tried, but the highest percentage of unauthorized immigrants deported in a given year is 2.1 percent - three times the amount this administration deported in 2017.

They're the kind of people Rye Barcott depended on. He's a former Marine captain who served in Iraq. For Barcott, there's no substitute for having a flesh-and-blood interpreter by your side when you're gathering intelligence, specifically, a trusted linguist who can translate all aspects of a conversation – the verbal and the non-verbal. But as Barcott points out, ((ul))((hl))few units((/hl))((/ul)), especially in the infantry, ((ul))((hl))have access to human interpreters((/hl))((/ul)). ((ul))((hl))Machine translation could help((/hl))((/ul)), with basic information at least. \"When a Marine or Army unit's out patrolling and they need to ask a person for permission to enter their property for example, ((ul))((hl))it's far better to have a machine((/hl))((/ul)) than to not have anything,\" Barcott said. In recent years, the US military has adopted a policy of trying to give everyone who deploys some knowledge, something to hang their hat on. \"Hello. And thank you for your interest in learning more about V Communicator Mobile – the first deployed and fielded mobile military application.\" This is one of a ((ul))((hl))growing range of products out there designed to bridge the military language gap((/hl))((/ul)). Ernie Bright is the product manager for V Communicator Mobile, which runs on a modified iPod Touch. Bright said the focus was on assisting soldiers, not distracting them. \"We knew that they were needing a more mobile easy-to-use product that would allow them to learn key tactical phrases, and also be able to just pick it up and use it,\" Bright said. ((ul))((hl))It's impressive, quickly translating a phrase((/hl))((/ul)) such as 'do you have any weapons?' into the equivalent language in, say, Pashto. But it's not the only translation device out there vying for a potentially lucrative military contract. Another mobile app is called SpeechTrans. According to the company's co-founder, Yan Auerbach, \"It allows you to speak into the device in your native language; it will translate and speak aloud the translation instantly.\" Dialects It's equally impressive. SpeechTrans draws on an archive of voice samples, but it doesn't yet cover every language or – crucially with languages such as Arabic – every dialect. Yan Auerbach tells me his company is now in the running for a Pentagon project called BOLT (Boundless Operational Language Translation). The goal for BOLT is lofty: technology that would recognize not just dialects but localized slang too. That still leaves a lot of missing information: gestures and body language. It's something Ernie Bright and the V Communicator Mobile team have been thinking about. On their device, attention is paid to non-verbal communication too. For every piece of language you get an animated video, demonstrating the appropriate gesture. It's meant to help soldiers learn the language too. \"They can remember that this phrase coincides with this gesture or this body language,\" said Bright. Interpreting gestures That's fine for stock phrases at checkpoints and the like. But soldiers have to interpret gestures as much as they have to reproduce them. And they have to do it in the blink of an eye. Could a machine ever do that work too? When it comes to translation technology, no-one yet knows where the lines will be drawn. All languages – all communications – are built on ever-shifting sands of meaning. That ((ul))((hl))meaning can't ever be fully, totally captured by technology((/hl))((/ul)).

In the worst cases, ((ul))((hl))innocent civilians can be arrested or wrongly targeted((/hl))((/ul)) as Taliban fighters. Zalmai Zurmutai, a Pashto translator for NATO troops in Afghanistan, is angry about what he has seen happen when ((ul))((hl))unqualified translators serve as a liaison((/hl))((/ul)) between foreign troops and Afghan villagers. For example, Zurmutai says, when a Dari speaker from northern Afghanistan is sent out with NATO troops to Pashtun parts of southern Afghanistan, ((ul))((hl))it is not unusual for the translator to have difficulties((/hl))((/ul)) understanding the local Pashto dialect. Other times, Zurmutai says, a young Afghan translator who has grown up in Europe or the United States does not understand the traditional tribal culture of Pashtun villagers.

Imagine when a [native Dari speaker] becomes a translator and goes into a Pashtun village where the people cannot speak Dari -- and the translator cannot understand [their local dialect of] Pashto. \"Unfortunately, there are so many translators like this who are unable to convey the meaning of Pashto speakers to the coalition forces. And he can't convoy the message of foreign troops to these local people,\" Zurmutai continues. \"There also are some Afghan translators who are coming from other countries who are less familiar with the Afghan culture. They don't know about the tribal value system. Or there are some emotional young Afghans who don't care about the local values. They have very rude behavior -- very [undiplomatic and] cruel -- without respect for people. They are creating misunderstandings between local people and the coalition forces. They are destroying mutual trust. There are some translators who are working for their own political, personal and tribal interests. These translators are treating people in a very bad way.\" John McHugh is an independent filmmaker whose documentary \"Lost In Translation -- Afghanistan\" was released on the Internet this summer by The Guardian newspaper group. Filmed while McHugh was embedded with U.S. troops near the Afghan-Pakistan border, the eight-minute documentary shows how tensions rise between U.S. soldiers and Pashtun villagers when a Dari-speaking translator is unable to understand a village elder's Waziri dialect. 'Is It Any Wonder?' The elder gives lengthy answers to the U.S. soldiers' questions about the lack of security in their village and the threats against them by Taliban fighters who regularly cross the nearby border with Pakistan. The ((ul))((hl))translator fails to convey((/hl))((/ul)) the elder's ((ul))((hl))concerns((/hl))((/ul)). \"The soldiers ask to speak to the village elders, but everything gets lost in translation,\" McHugh says. \"Everything here hinges on the translation -- the subtleties of Pashto and English.

Is it any wonder that the Americans feel baffled in these situations and that ordinary Afghans feel ignored?\" Zurmutai says there are ((ul))((hl))many misunderstandings during NATO military operations in Afghanistan that are caused by bad translations((/hl))((/ul)). Zurmutai described one case in which a translator wrongly told NATO troops that an encampment of Pashtun nomads -- a Kochi tribe -- were Taliban fighters. He says it was only the last-minute intervention of another translator that stopped NATO from calling in an air strike on the tents of the innocent nomads. \"Unfortunately, we can't deny that there are tribal and regional differences between Afghans today. And translators are involved in this stuff,\" Zurmutai says. \"Many translators have been sacked because of creating these kinds of conflicts. Recently, so many people have been killed in mistaken bombardments that were later found to be the result of bad translations. \"Nowadays, coalition forces understand that the real source of the problem is with the translators.

((ul))This ((/ul))((ul))((hl))is hardly a new anxiety((/hl))((/ul)). In 1946, atomic bomb maker J. Robert ((ul))Oppenheimer((/ul)) ominously ((ul))warned that((/ul)) if three or four men could smuggle in units for ((ul))an atomic bomb((/ul)), they ((ul))could blow up New York. This((/ul)) ((ul))was an early expression of a pattern of dramatic risk inflation((/ul)) that has persisted throughout the nuclear age. In fact, although expanding fires and fallout might increase the effective destructive radius, ((ul))the blast of a Hiroshima-size device would “blow up((/ul))” about ((ul))1% of the city’s area((/ul))—a tragedy, of course, but not the same as one 100 times greater. In the early 1970s, nuclear physicist Theodore Taylor proclaimed the atomic terrorist problem to be “immediate,” explaining at length “how comparatively easy it would be to steal nuclear material and step by step make it into a bomb.” At the time he thought it was already too late to “prevent the making of a few bombs, here and there, now and then,” or “in another ten or fifteen years, it will be too late.” Three decades after Taylor, ((ul))we continue to wait for terrorists to carry out their “easy” task((/ul)). ((ul))In contrast to((/ul)) these ((ul))predictions, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))terrorist groups((/hl))((/ul)) seem to ((ul))((hl))have exhibited((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) only ((/ul))((ul))((hl))limited desire and((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) even ((/ul))((ul))((hl))less ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))progress((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) in going((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))atomic((/hl))((/ul)). This may be because, after brief exploration of the possible routes, they, unlike generations of alarmists, have discovered that ((ul))((hl))the((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) tremendous ((/ul))((ul))((hl))effort((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) required ((/ul))((ul))((hl))is scarcely likely to be successful((/hl))((/ul)). The most plausible route for terrorists, according to most experts, would be to manufacture an atomic device themselves from purloined fissile material (plutonium or, more likely, highly enriched uranium). This task, however, remains a daunting one, requiring that a considerable series of difficult hurdles be conquered and in sequence. Outright ((ul))armed ((/ul))((ul))((hl))theft of fissile material is((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) exceedingly ((/ul))((ul))((hl))unlikely((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) not only ((/ul))((ul))((hl))because of the resistance of guards((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), but because chase would be immediate((/ul)). A more promising approach would be to corrupt insiders to smuggle out the required substances. However, ((ul))this requires the terrorists to pay off a host of greedy confederates((/ul)), including brokers and money-transmitters, ((ul))any one of whom could turn on them or((/ul)), either out of guile or incompetence, ((ul))furnish them with stuff that is useless((/ul)). Insiders might also consider the possibility that once the heist was accomplished, the terrorists would, as analyst Brian Jenkins none too delicately puts it, “have every incentive to cover their trail, beginning with eliminating their confederates.” ((ul))If terrorists were somehow successful at obtaining((/ul)) a sufficient mass of ((ul))relevant material, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))they would((/hl))((/ul)) then probably ((ul))((hl))have to transport it a ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))long distance((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) over ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))unfamiliar terrain((/hl))((/ul)) and probably ((ul))((hl))while being pursued by security forces((/hl))((/ul)). Crossing international borders would be facilitated by following established ((ul))smuggling routes((/ul)), but these ((ul))are not as chaotic as they appear and are((/ul)) often ((ul))under the watch of suspicious and careful criminal regulators((/ul)). If border personnel became suspicious of the commodity being smuggled, some of them might find it in their interest to disrupt passage, perhaps to collect the bounteous reward money that would probably be offered by alarmed governments once the uranium theft had been discovered. ((ul))Once outside the country((/ul)) with their precious booty, ((ul))((hl))terrorists would need to set up a large and well-equipped((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) machine ((/ul))((ul))((hl))shop((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) to manufacture a bomb and then to populate it ((/ul))((ul))((hl))with((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) a very select team of ((/ul))((ul))((hl))highly skilled scientists((/hl))((/ul)), technicians, machinists, and administrators. ((ul))The group would have to be assembled and retained for the monumental task while no consequential suspicions were generated((/ul)) among friends, family, and police about their curious and sudden absence from normal pursuits back home. ((ul))Members of the bomb-building team((/ul)) would also have to be utterly devoted to the cause, of course, and they ((ul))would have to be willing to put their lives((/ul)) and certainly their careers ((ul))at high risk((/ul)), because after their bomb was discovered or exploded they would probably become the targets of an intense worldwide dragnet operation. Some observers have insisted that it would be easy for terrorists to assemble a crude bomb if they could get enough fissile material. But Christoph Wirz and Emmanuel Egger, two senior physicists in charge of nuclear issues at Switzerland‘s Spiez Laboratory, bluntly conclude that ((ul))the task “could hardly be accomplished by a subnational group((/ul)).” They point out that ((ul))((hl))precise blueprints((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) are required((/hl))((/ul)), not just sketches and general ideas, and that ((ul))even with a good blueprint the terrorist group would((/ul)) most certainly ((ul))be forced to redesign((/ul)). They also stress that ((ul))((hl))the work is((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) difficult, dangerous, and extremely exacting((/ul)), and that the ((ul))technical requirements((/ul)) in several fields ((ul))verge on the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))unfeasible((/hl))((/ul)). Stephen Younger, former director of nuclear weapons research at Los Alamos Laboratories, has made a similar argument, pointing out that ((ul))uranium is “exceptionally difficult to machine((/ul))” whereas “((ul))plutonium is one of the most complex metals ever discovered((/ul)), a material whose basic properties are sensitive to exactly how it is processed.“ Stressing the “daunting problems associated with material purity, machining, and a host of other issues,” Younger concludes, “((ul))to think that a terrorist group, working in isolation with an unreliable supply of electricity and little access to tools and supplies” could fabricate a bomb “is farfetched at best((/ul)).” ((ul))Under the best circumstances,((/ul)) ((ul))((hl))the process((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) of making a bomb ((/ul))((ul))((hl))could take((/hl))((/ul)) months or even ((ul))((hl))a year((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) or more, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))which would((/hl))((/ul)), of course, ((ul))((hl))have to be carried out in((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) utter ((/ul))((ul))((hl))secrecy((/hl))((/ul)). In addition, people in the area, including criminals, may observe with increasing curiosity and puzzlement the constant coming and going of technicians unlikely to be locals. ((ul))If the effort to build a bomb was successful, the finished product, weighing a ton((/ul)) or more, ((ul))would then have to be transported to and smuggled into the relevant target country where it would have to be received by collaborators who are((/ul)) at once ((ul))totally dedicated and technically proficient((/ul)) at handling, maintaining, detonating, and perhaps assembling the weapon after it arrives. ((ul))The financial costs((/ul)) of this extensive and extended operation ((ul))could((/ul)) easily ((ul))become monumental. There would be expensive equipment to buy, smuggle, and set up and people to pay or pay off((/ul)). Some operatives might work for free out of utter dedication to the cause, but the ((ul))vast conspiracy((/ul)) also ((ul))requires((/ul)) the subversion of ((ul))a considerable array of criminals((/ul)) and opportunists, ((ul))each of whom has every incentive to push the price for cooperation as high as possible((/ul)). Any criminals competent and capable enough to be effective allies are also likely to be both smart enough to see boundless opportunities for extortion and psychologically equipped by their profession to be willing to exploit them. Those who warn about the likelihood of a terrorist bomb contend that a terrorist group could, if with great difficulty, overcome each obstacle and that doing so in each case is “not impossible.” But ((ul))although it may not be impossible to surmount each individual step, the likelihood that a group could surmount a series of them quickly becomes vanishingly small((/ul)). Table 1 attempts to catalogue the barriers that must be overcome under the scenario considered most likely to be successful. In contemplating the task before them, would-be ((ul))atomic terrorists((/ul)) would effectively be required to go though an exercise that looks much like this. If and when they do, they ((ul))will undoubtedly conclude that their prospects are((/ul)) daunting and accordingly uninspiring or even ((ul))terminally dispiriting((/ul)). It is possible to calculate the chances for success. ((ul))Adopting probability estimates that((/ul)) purposely and ((ul))heavily bias((/ul)) the case ((ul))in the terrorists’ favor((/ul))—for example, assuming the terrorists have a 50% chance of overcoming each of the 20 obstacles—the chances that a concerted effort would be successful comes out to be less than one in a million. If one assumes, somewhat more realistically, that their chances at each barrier are one in three, ((ul))((hl))the((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) cumulative ((/ul))((ul))((hl))odds that they will be able to pull off the deed drop to ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))one in((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) well over ((/ul))((ul))((hl))three billion((/hl))((/ul)). ((ul))Other routes((/ul)) would-be ((ul))terrorists might take to acquire a bomb are even more problematic. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))They are unlikely to be given or sold a bomb((/hl))((/ul)) by a generous like-minded nuclear state for delivery abroad ((ul))because the risk would be high((/ul)), even for a country led by extremists, ((ul))that the bomb (and its source) would be discovered((/ul)) even before delivery or that it would be exploded in a manner and on a target the donor would not approve, including on the donor itself. Another concern would be that ((ul))((hl))the terrorist group might be infiltrated((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) by foreign intelligence((/ul)). ((ul))((hl))The((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) terrorist ((/ul))((ul))((hl))group might((/hl))((/ul)) also seek to ((ul))((hl))steal((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) or illicitly purchase ((/ul))((ul))((hl))a “((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))loose nuke((/hl))((/ul))“ somewhere. However, it seems probable that ((ul))((hl))none exist((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). All governments have an intense interest in controlling any weapons on their territory((/ul)) because of fears that they might become the primary target. Moreover, as technology has developed, ((ul))finished ((/ul))((ul))((hl))bombs have been out-fitted with devices that((/hl))((/ul)) trigger a non-nuclear explosion that ((ul))((hl))destroys the bomb ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))if((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) it is ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))tampered with((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). And there are other security techniques((/ul)): Bombs can be kept disassembled with the component parts stored in separate high-security vaults, and a process can be set up in which two people and ((ul))((hl))multiple codes are required((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) not only to use the bomb but to store, maintain, and deploy it((/ul)). As Younger points out, “only a few people in the world have the knowledge to cause an unauthorized detonation of a nuclear weapon.” There could be dangers in the chaos that would emerge ((ul))if a nuclear state were to utterly collapse((/ul)); Pakistan is frequently cited in this context and sometimes North Korea as well. However, even under such conditions, ((ul))((hl))nuclear weapons would((/hl))((/ul)) probably ((ul))((hl))remain under heavy guard((/hl))((/ul)) by people who know that a purloined bomb might be used in their own territory.

The al Qaeda factor ((ul))The degree to which al Qaeda((/ul)), the only terrorist group that seems to want to target the United States, ((ul))has pursued or even has much interest in a nuclear weapon may have been exaggerated((/ul)). The 9/11 Commission stated that “al Qaeda has tried to acquire or make nuclear weapons for at least ten years,” but the only substantial evidence it supplies comes from an episode that is supposed to have taken place about 1993 in Sudan, when al Qaeda members may have sought to purchase some uranium that turned out to be bogus. Information about this supposed venture apparently comes entirely from Jamal al Fadl, who defected from al Qaeda in 1996 after being caught stealing $110,000 from the organization. Others, including the man who allegedly purchased the uranium, assert that although there were various other scams taking place at the time that may have served as grist for Fadl, ((ul))the uranium episode never happened((/ul)). As a key indication of al Qaeda’s desire to obtain atomic weapons, many have focused on a set of conversations in Afghanistan in August 2001 that two Pakistani nuclear scientists reportedly had with Osama bin Laden and three other al Qaeda officials. Pakistani intelligence officers characterize the discussions as “academic” in nature. It seems that the discussion was wide-ranging and rudimentary and that the scientists provided no material or specific plans. Moreover, the ((ul))scientists((/ul)) probably ((ul))were incapable of providing truly helpful information because their expertise was not in bomb design((/ul)) but in the processing of fissile material, ((ul))which is((/ul)) almost ((ul))certainly beyond the capacities of a nonstate group((/ul)). Kalid Sheikh Mohammed, the apparent planner of the 9/11 attacks, reportedly says that ((ul))al Qaeda’s bomb efforts never went beyond searching the Internet((/ul)). After the fall of the Taliban in 2001, technical experts from the CIA and the Department of Energy examined documents and other information that were uncovered by intelligence agencies and the media in Afghanistan. They uncovered no credible information that al Qaeda had obtained fissile material or acquired a nuclear weapon. Moreover, they found no evidence of any radioactive material suitable for weapons. They did uncover, however, a “nuclear-related” document discussing “openly available concepts about the nuclear fuel cycle and some weapons-related issues.” Just a day or two before al Qaeda was to flee from Afghanistan in 2001, bin Laden supposedly told a Pakistani journalist, “If the United States uses chemical or nuclear weapons against us, we might respond with chemical and nuclear weapons. We possess these weapons as a deterrent.” Given the military pressure that they were then under and taking into account the evidence of the primitive or more probably nonexistent nature of al Qaeda’s nuclear program, ((ul))the reported assertions((/ul)), although unsettling, ((ul))appear at best to be a desperate bluff((/ul)). Bin Laden has made statements about nuclear weapons a few other times. Some of these pronouncements can be seen to be threatening, but they are rather coy and indirect, indicating perhaps something of an interest, but not acknowledging a capability. And as terrorism specialist Louise Richardson observes, “((ul))Statements claiming a right to possess nuclear weapons have been misinterpreted((/ul)) as expressing a determination to use them. ((ul))This((/ul)) in turn ((ul))has fed the exaggeration of the threat we face((/ul)).” Norwegian researcher Anne Stenersen concluded after an exhaustive study of available materials that, although “it is likely that al Qaeda central has considered the option of using non-conventional weapons,” ((ul))there is “little evidence that((/ul)) such ((ul))ideas ever developed into actual plans((/ul)), or that they were given any kind of priority at the expense of more traditional types of terrorist attacks.” She also notes that information on an al Qaeda computer left behind in Afghanistan in 2001 indicates that only $2,000 to ((ul))$4,000 was earmarked for weapons of mass destruction research((/ul)) and that ((ul))the money was((/ul)) mainly ((ul))for((/ul)) very crude work on ((ul))chemical weapons((/ul)). Today, the key portions of al Qaeda central may well total only a few hundred people, apparently assisting the Taliban’s distinctly separate, far larger, and very troublesome insurgency in Afghanistan. Beyond this tiny band, there are thousands of sympathizers and would-be jihadists spread around the globe. They mainly connect in Internet chat rooms, engage in radicalizing conversations, and variously dare each other to actually do something. ((ul))Any “threat((/ul)),” particularly to the West, ((ul))appears((/ul)), then, ((ul))principally to derive from self-selected people((/ul)), often isolated from each other, ((ul))who fantasize about performing dire deeds((/ul)). From time to time some of these people, or ones closer to al Qaeda central, actually manage to do some harm. And occasionally, they may even be able to pull off something large, such as 9/11. But in most cases, ((ul))their capacities and schemes((/ul)), or alleged schemes, ((ul))seem to be far less dangerous than initial press reports vividly, even hysterically, suggest((/ul)). Most important for present purposes, however, is that ((ul))any notion that al Qaeda has the capacity to acquire nuclear weapons, even if it wanted to, looks farfetched in the extreme((/ul)). It is also noteworthy that, although there have been plenty of terrorist attacks in the world since 2001, all have relied on conventional destructive methods. For the most part, terrorists seem to be heeding the advice found in a memo on an al Qaeda laptop seized in Pakistan in 2004: “Make use of that which is available … rather than waste valuable time becoming despondent over that which is not within your reach.” In fact, ((ul))history consistently demonstrates that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))terrorists prefer((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))weapons((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) that ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))they know((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) and understand, not new, exotic ones((/ul)). Glenn Carle, a 23-year CIA veteran and once its deputy intelligence officer for transnational threats, warns, “((ul))We must not take fright at the specter our leaders have exaggerated((/ul)). In fact, ((ul))we must see jihadists for the small, lethal, disjointed, and miserable opponents that they are((/ul)).” al Qaeda, he says, has only a handful of individuals capable of planning, organizing, and leading a terrorist organization, and although the group has threatened attacks with nuclear weapons, “((ul))its capabilities are far inferior to its desires((/ul)).” Policy alternatives The purpose here has not been to argue that policies designed to inconvenience the atomic terrorist are necessarily unneeded or unwise. Rather, in contrast with the many who insist that ((ul))atomic terrorism((/ul)) under current conditions is rather likely— indeed, exceedingly likely—to come about, I have contended that it ((ul))is hugely unlikely((/ul)). However, it is important to consider not only the likelihood that an event will take place, but also its consequences. Therefore, one must be concerned about catastrophic events even if their probability is small, and efforts to reduce that likelihood even further may well be justified. ((ul))At some point((/ul)), however, ((ul))probabilities become so low that((/ul)), even for catastrophic events, ((ul))it may make sense to ignore them((/ul)) or at least put them on the back burner; in short, ((ul))the risk becomes acceptable((/ul)). For example, the British could at any time attack the United States with their submarine-launched missiles and kill millions of Americans, far more than even the most monumentally gifted and lucky terrorist group. Yet the risk that this potential calamity might take place evokes little concern; essentially it is an acceptable risk. Meanwhile, Russia, with whom the United States has a rather strained relationship, could at any time do vastly more damage with its nuclear weapons, a fully imaginable calamity that is substantially ignored. In constructing what he calls “a case for fear,” Cass Sunstein, a scholar and current Obama administration official, has pointed out that if there is a yearly probability of 1 in 100,000 that terrorists could launch a nuclear or massive biological attack, the risk would cumulate to 1 in 10,000 over 10 years and to 1 in 5,000 over 20. These odds, he suggests, are “not the most comforting.” Comfort, of course, lies in the viscera of those to be comforted, and, as he suggests, many would probably have difficulty settling down with odds like that. But ((ul))there must be some point at which the concerns((/ul)) even of these people ((ul))would ease((/ul)). Just perhaps ((ul))it is at((/ul)) one of the levels suggested above: one in a million or ((ul))one in three billion((/ul)) per attempt."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":177}},{"tag":"No risk or impact to nuclear terror – way too many barriers ","cite":"Eaves 16 - Masters degree in international affairs from the School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University (Elizabeth, “What Does \"Nuclear Terrorism\" Really Mean?” The Bulletin, 4/7,  http://thebulletin.org/what-does-nuclear-terrorism-really-mean9309)","text":["((ul))Least likely: a nuclear weapon((/ul)).

As for building an atomic weapon, ((ul))it’s unlikely that terrorists could make anything as sophisticated as the warheads owned by governments,((/ul)) but making a crude nuclear bomb—an improvised nuclear device, or IND—is “potentially within the capabilities of a technically sophisticated terrorist group,” according to the Belfer Center report.

((ul))Even Al Qaeda((/ul)), which in the 1990s and early 2000s had deep pockets, a centralized command structure, and many scientists in its employ, ((ul))was not able to acquire material suitable for a nuclear weapon despite its best efforts.((/ul)) ((ul))There have been reports of ((/ul))((ul))((hl))attempts to sell nuclear material((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) in countries in the Black Sea area, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))but none has been successful((/hl))((/ul)), as far as has been made publicly known. Most likely: a dirty bomb. None of this is to suggest that the international community shouldn’t worry about the world’s nuclear arsenals; we would all be unequivocally safer if there were fewer atomic weapons and less nuclear-weapon-ready material around. But we’re far more likely to see the second scenario—((ul))a dirty bomb((/ul)) attack—than a nuclear explosion in the near future. So what ((ul))will((/ul)) that ((ul))look((/ul)) like? ((ul))Nothing like the aftermath of a nuclear weapon attack.((/ul)) As the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission explains, “A dirty bomb is in no way similar to a nuclear weapon.” The latter relies on fission or fusion to create an explosion millions of times more powerful than the former.

By comparison, China’s months-long control of the disputed Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea and its law enforcement assertions in Senkaku territorial waters continue unabated with institutional mechanisms to manage such crises practically non-existent. Frosty bilateral relations make this state of affairs unlikely to be reversed. A code of conduct in the South China Sea and a maritime communication mechanism in the East China Sea will first require that Manila and Tokyo engender an element of political quiet and trust in their respective relationships with Beijing. The origins of the stand-off in the Ladakh Himalayas are in the recent construction of permanent structures by the Indian side at a (separate but) similarly sensitive forward observation point in the disputed western sector — a violation, for the Chinese side, of long-standing border protocols. That the Indian post abuts an arterial road link (Aksai Chin highway) that connects Xinjiang to Tibet prompted Beijing to establish its own skeletal presence barely two-dozen miles removed from the strategic China-India-Pakistan border tri-junction area. With both sides having telegraphed their respective strengths and sensitivities, the PLA presence and the Indian construction activity were thereafter withdrawn. Provocative probes and presence-marking operations that were implicitly directed at undermining China’s control of the strategic Aksai Chin highway, a core strategic interest, at a time when Tibet was in ferment, had been a key precipitating cause of the Sino-Indian war of 1962.

The following year, this arrangement was enlarged to include three other European nations (Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands) and became the Brussels Treaty, which includes a commitment to use military force if one of the treaty's parties is attacked. The Brussels Treaty was modified in 1954 to include Germany and Italy and remains in force today.

More recently, the EU made the historical decision to include a security clause in its draft constitution that amounts to a mutual security guarantee with the possibility of military assistance. The formulation agreed on by EU governments in December 2003 states: If a Member State is the victim of armed aggression on its territory, the other Member States shall have towards it an obligation of aid and assistance by all the means in their power, in accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.

James L. Jones said today at the Europe Atlantic Council here. Jones stepped down as NATO's supreme allied commander earlier this month. While some aspects of the alliance may need work, Jones said that, on the whole, it ((hl))is an \"((/hl))((ul))((hl))incredibly healthy((/hl))((/ul))((hl)) organization((/hl)).\"  Jones assumed his office in January 2003 after serving as the commandant of the Marine Corps. During his time in the position, the alliance has changed dramatically. \"Perhaps the highlight of the last four years was witnessing the accession of seven new nations into the alliance in 2004,\" he said. \"It was a very emotional moment for seven former Warsaw Pact countries.\" Membership in NATO meant acceptance in the free world to the former communist countries, Jones said. \"There was a sort of palpable enthusiasm for freedom, democracy, rule of law and just the vast potential for those people that had been unleashed,\" he said. \"You feel every day their enthusiasm from these new members.\" During Jones' tenure, the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan grew from a force providing security in and around the Afghan capital of Kabul, to providing security for the entire country. The NATO commander in Afghanistan now commands 32,000 troops from 32 different countries, Jones said. ((hl))The NATO mission in Afghanistan((/hl)) ((hl))and((/hl)) NATO training mission in ((hl))Iraq((/hl)) are just two operations that ((hl))show the term \"out of area operations\" is obsolete((/hl))((hl)),((/hl)) he said. During the Cold War, NATO's job was to defend Western Europe from the menace of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact. There were no \"out-of-area operations, nor was the possibility even really contemplated,\" he said. \"It is a given that NATO is operating today on three different continents with more than 50,000 troops committed to NATO missions,\" he said. Troops under NATO command operate in Asia, Africa and Europe, and Jones said the alliance is also embracing change. \"Nowhere was that more in evidence than in establishing the NATO Response Force,\" he said. The force - 25,000 personnel ready to deploy at a moment's notice - is now fully operational and capable. The general said the force is NATO's greatest commitment to transformation. The force is ready to \"take on missions at a strategic distance, but in an expeditionary manner,\" he said. The NATO Response Force's first real deployment - to Pakistan to help with humanitarian relief following the earthquakes in January 2005 - is a prime example of this, Jones said. The fact that the force's first mission was a humanitarian operation has also caused some reassessment in NATO, he said. \"((hl))NATO is reinventing itself((/hl))((hl)) ((/hl))and re-explaining itself because in this world NATO is thought of, correctly, as principally a warfighting organization,\" he said. \"This transformation of NATO - going from a reactive 20th-century force, which it needed to be, to a 21st-century more expeditionary and agile force - brings with a whole lot of things\" that countries didn't realize when they signed up for the process in 2002. \"It has caused a lot of pain because it gets you into such things as multinational logistics (and) organic intelligence, which NATO has never had,\" he said. Other transformational aspects during Jones' command included eliminating duplicate NATO headquarters, disestablishing the Alled Command Atlantic and replacing it with the Allied Command Transformation and placing all operations under Allied Command Europe. This is not to say there are not problems that NATO must address, Jones said. First and foremost is money. The per capita share of many countries has actually gone down since the Prague Summit in 2002. NATO nations agreed during that summit to spend roughly 3 percent of their gross domestic product on defense. Another problem is national caveats, Jones said. This is where troops assigned to a mission has such stringent restrictions placed on them, that commanders can hardly use them. But ((hl))the alliance is ((/hl))((hl))remarkably adaptable and resilient((/hl)), Jones said. \"The other bit of evidence that the alliance is healthy is that I know of ((hl))no countries that are trying to leave the alliance((/hl)),\" Jones said. \"And I know ((hl))quite a few((/hl))((hl)) ((/hl))that ((hl))are trying to((/hl))((hl)) ((/hl))queue up and measure up to ((hl))become members ((/hl))by as early as 2008.\""],"stats":{"highlightedWords":54}},{"tag":"Past events prove NATO is resilient","cite":"Corn 7 (Tony, Ph.D. – University of Paris and Graduate – U.S. Naval War College, “The Revolution in Transatlantic Affairs”, Real Clear Politics, 8-21, http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/08/the_revolution_in_transatlanti.html)","text":["If ((hl))the Alliance((/hl)) survived a debacle of the magnitude of Suez in 1956, it ((hl))can((/hl))((ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))withstand anything((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).

Oil is an extremely valuable natural resource. However, ((ul))((hl))invasion((/hl))((/ul)), occupation, international, and investment ((ul))((hl))costs reduce the payoffs of seizing foreign resources((/hl))((/ul)). ((ul))((hl))Profiting from seized oil is difficult at best((/hl))((/ul)) and impossible at worst. As a result, petroleum ((ul))((hl))prizes are not sufficiently valuable for oil to be a significant contributor to leaders’ decisions((/hl))((/ul)) for international war. Consequently, a territory’s petroleum endowments are a poor predictor of its ability to inspire interstate conflict. These observations have positive implications for contemporary disputes in oil-rich regions like the South China Sea, East China Sea, eastern Mediterranean, and Arctic, as they suggest that ((ul))((hl))competition over((/hl))((/ul)) these ((ul))((hl))territories’ oil resources will not lead to intense militarized conflicts((/hl))((/ul)). However, one might counter this optimistic assessment by arguing that the contemporary contests are not analogous to the historical cases. The greatest difference between them is that, in the current disputes, political authority is ambiguous; multiple countries have legitimate claims to contested territories. Consequently, in these areas, an aggressor would not be seizing “foreign” oil. This distinction would reduce occupation costs, as local resistance would be more restrained.140 Invasion costs would also be lower, since most of the resources at stake in these contests are prospective; there is less oil infrastructure for aggressors and targets to destroy.141 These arguments have some merit. However, ((ul))((hl))prospective resources also generate higher investment costs((/hl))((/ul)), as ((ul))((hl))countries must explore for oil((/hl))((/ul)), instead of just producing it.

In addition, ((ul))((hl))international costs remain high((/hl))((/ul)), as the international community condemns the use of force in all territorial disagreements, including those where political authority is ambiguous. Hence, the ((ul))((hl))costs of aggression should still deter contemporary adversaries from fighting for oil((/hl))((/ul)).

As a result, they have overestimated the risks posed by oil competi- tion. By adopting a more holistic approach, this chapter has demonstrated that ((ul))((hl))major interstate conflicts((/hl))((/ul)), ((ul))((hl))targeting oil fields, are exceptional((/hl))((/ul)). ((ul))((hl))Most contests((/hl))((/ul)) for control over oil resources ((ul))((hl))are merely oil spats((/hl))((/ul)), ((ul))((hl))which do not escalate((/hl))((/ul)) into serious conflicts. Contemporary competitions in areas like the Arctic, Caspian Sea, East China Sea, Eastern Mediterranean, and South China Sea have thus far fallen into this category. Although oil-related con- frontations, like the 2014 Sino-Vietnamese rig incident or Turkey’s deploy ment of the Barbaros in 2014–15, occur periodically, ((ul))((hl))leaders((/hl))((/ul)) have ((ul))((hl))prevented((/hl))((/ul)) the ((ul))((hl))incidents from intensifying((/hl))((/ul)). ((ul))((hl))They are likely to maintain this restraint((/hl))((/ul)) in the future. As the chapter’s historical analysis demonstrates, ((ul))((hl))even rival states((/hl))((/ul)), with defense guarantees from foreign powers and hostile domestic populations, ((ul))((hl))do not intensify((/hl))((/ul)) oil spats. Regional petroleum competition is therefore not a serious threat to international security. Although claimant countries may eventually fight over other issues, such as control over sea lanes, regional hegemony, or national pride, oil competition will not be the trigger for these conflicts. Meanwhile, ((ul))((hl))wars for((/hl))((/ul)) survival, targeting ((ul))((hl))oil resources, are currently improbable((/hl))((/ul)), both because of their historical rarity and because ((ul))((hl))contemporary oil consumers and producers are unlikely to experience((/hl))((/ul)) the three ((ul))((hl))necessary con- ditions for launching major campaigns((/hl))((/ul)) against foreign fields. ((ul))((hl))Consumers((/hl))((/ul)) like the US, China, and the European Union can ((ul))((hl))rely on international trade((/hl))((/ul)) to meet national import needs ((ul))((hl))without compromising national energy security((/hl))((/ul)). ((ul))((hl))Supply shutoffs((/hl))((/ul)), like the OPEC embargo in 1973–74, ((ul))((hl))are unlikely((/hl))((/ul)), due to a lack of coordination among major producers. They are ((ul))((hl))also unthreatening because of the oil market’s current diversity and flexibility((/hl))((/ul)). Moreover, even in 1975, in the aftermath of the first energy crisis, American authori- ties concluded that it was not worth the effort to seize Middle Eastern oil fields (Congressional Research Service 1975). Today’s consumers are even less inclined to do so. ((ul))((hl))Producers will((/hl))((/ul)) also ((ul))((hl))refrain from using intense militarized force((/hl))((/ul)) to increase national oil endowments. This ((ul))((hl))restraint arises as much from a lack of capacity as from a lack of will((/hl))((/ul)). States like Algeria, Angola, Iraq, Nigeria, and Venezuela have ((ul))((hl))strong incentives to increase national oil reserves and revenue((/hl))((/ul)), due to their intense dependence on oil rents and their small foreign exchange reserves, which make them highly vulnerable to oil price drops. However, ((ul))((hl))they lack promising targets for international aggression((/hl))((/ul)). Angola and Nigeria’s neighbors are small producers, while Algeria has little to gain from seizing Libya’s disordered petroleum industry. Venezuela has a more appealing target in Colombia, but is weaker than its neighbor, so Caracas is unlikely to launch an attack. Iraq is also constrained, both by Iran’s military strength and by the certainty of a vigorous third-party response to another assault on Kuwait. Thus, today’s producers, as well as consumers, are unlikely aggressors. States may continue to spar for control over oil.

((ul))((hl))Stronger demand((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))The reason for the current price hikes differs from the past. Increases in the 1970s and 1980s were caused largely by sharp disruptions to world supply. In contrast, a prime reason for the increases since 2000 has been stronger-than-expected demand from emerging market economies. The ((ul))((hl))strong growth of emerging markets((/hl))((/ul)) has ((ul))((hl))benefited((/hl))((/ul)) both them and ((ul))((hl))the global economy((/hl))((/ul)): raising living standards and increasing their demand for products made abroad. A side-effect of this may have been an increase in oil prices, but this has not derailed the benefits of increased growth. 2. ((ul))((hl))Central bank policies((/hl))((/ul)) Central banks and economies have ((ul))((hl))become more adept at dealing with price shocks((/hl))((/ul)). In the 1970s and 1980s, oil price rises triggered fears of inflation, and workers would try to protect themselves by demanding higher nominal wage increases. This had the effect of setting off wage-price spirals. Now, ((ul))((hl))greater awareness of the impact((/hl))((/ul)) of high wage increases—including lost employment and reforms to labor markets—((ul))((hl))have led to more job-friendly wage setting((/hl))((/ul)). ((ul))((hl))Central banks have become more adept at convincing workers((/hl))((/ul)) that ((ul))((hl))oil price increases will not feed((/hl))((/ul)) through into ((ul))((hl))inflation((/hl))((/ul)). Today, headline inflation temporarily increases after an oil price increase, but nominal wages hardly respond. Workers have grown to expect this rise in headline inflation, and anticipate that it will be temporary. Given the experience of the past, more recently many oil-importing economies with strong central banks have experienced little impact on core inflation and wage increases, despite oil price rises. This has allowed central banks to be more supportive of promoting recovery in the economy after an oil price increase, rather than having to raise interest rates to dampen inflationary expectations. 3. ((ul))((hl))Recycling the benefits of oil profits((/hl))((/ul)) The ((ul))((hl))revenues from oil exports are flowing back to oil-importing economies((/hl))((/ul)). This helps ((ul))((hl))bring down interest rates for households and firms((/hl))((/ul)), and so supports investment and growth in these economies. 4. ((ul))((hl))Greater efficiency((/hl))((/ul)) Oil price shocks do not have the same impact as in the past because ((ul))((hl))economies have become more efficient in the use of energy((/hl))((/ul)). The amount of energy it takes to produce a dollar of income has been steadily declining for 40 years. This decline in energy intensity is expected to continue. Major emerging markets are also becoming ((ul))((hl))more efficient in the use of energy, and they are expected to continue to make efficiency gains((/hl))((/ul)). By 2030, the major regions of the world—the United States, China, and India—are projected to have the same energy intensity. 5. ((ul))((hl))Diversification((/hl))((/ul)) ((ul))((hl))Countries((/hl))((/ul)) have ((ul))((hl))increasingly diversified their energy sources((/hl))((/ul)) over recent decades. They import energy from many more places than in the 1970s. They also ((ul))((hl))use more varied forms of energy((/hl))((/ul)). This ((ul))((hl))makes them less vulnerable to disruptions((/hl))((/ul)) from any one supplier or source of energy. The United States, for example, buys crude oil and gasoline from more than 40 countries and jet fuel from more than 25 countries. Countries have also ((ul))((hl))increased their use of natural gas, and are importing it from many more countries((/hl))((/ul)). Norway has continued to grow in importance as an exporter of natural gas, and several new producers have emerged, including Qatar, Turkmenistan, Nigeria, Egypt, and Australia. By 2030, it is expected that energy use will be even more diversified.

Boutrous Boutros-Gali said; ‘the next war in the Middle East will be over water, not politics’((/ul)) (Boutros Boutros-Gali in Butts, 1997, p. 65). ((ul))The question is not whether the sharing of transboundary water sparks political tension and alarmist declaration, but rather to what extent water has been a principal factor in international conflicts. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))The evidence seems((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) quite ((/ul))((ul))((hl))weak((/hl))((/ul)). Whether by president Sadat in Egypt or King Hussein in Jordan, ((ul))((hl))none((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) of these declarations ((/ul))((ul))((hl))have been followed((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) up ((/ul))((ul))((hl))by military action((/hl))((/ul)).¶ The governance of transboundary water has gained increased attention these last decades. This has a direct impact on the global food system as water allocation agreements determine the amount of water that can used for irrigated agriculture. The likelihood of conflicts over water is an important parameter to consider in assessing the stability, sustainability and resilience of global food systems.¶ ((ul))((hl))None of the((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) various and extensive ((/ul))((ul))((hl))databases on((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))causes of war show water as a c((/hl))((/ul))asus((ul))((hl)) b((/hl))((/ul))elli((ul))((hl)).((/hl))((/ul)) ((ul))Using the International Crisis Behavior (ICB) data set and supplementary data from the University of Alabama on water conflicts, Hewitt, Wolf and Hammer found only seven disputes where water seems to have been at least a partial cause for conflict((/ul)) (Wolf, 1998, p. 251). In fact, about 80% of the incidents relating to water were limited purely to governmental rhetoric intended for the electorate (Otchet, 2001, p. 18).¶ ((ul))As shown in The Basins At Risk (BAR) water event database, more than two-thirds of over 1800 ((/ul))((ul))((hl))water((/hl))((/ul))((ul))-related ‘((/ul))((ul))((hl))events’ fall on the ‘cooperative’ scale((/hl))((/ul)) (Yoffe et al., 2003).

Most specialists now tend to agree that the major issue is not scarcity per se but rather the allocation of water resources between the different riparian states (see for example [Allouche, 2005], [Allouche, 2007] and [Rouyer, 2000]). Water rich countries have been involved in a number of disputes with other relatively water rich countries (see for example India/Pakistan or Brazil/Argentina). The perception of each state’s estimated water needs really constitutes the core issue in transboundary water relations. Indeed, whether this scarcity exists or not in reality, perceptions of the amount of available water shapes people’s attitude towards the environment (Ohlsson, 1999). In fact, some water experts have argued that ((ul))scarcity drives the process of co-operation among riparians((/ul)) ([Dinar and Dinar, 2005] and [Brochmann and Gleditsch, 2006]).¶ ((ul))In terms of international relations, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the threat ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))of water wars due to increasing scarcity ((/ul))((ul))((hl))does not make((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) much ((/ul))((ul))((hl))sense in the light of((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) the recent ((/ul))((ul))((hl))historical record((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). Overall, the water war rationale expects conflict to occur over water, and appears to suggest that violence is a viable means of securing national water supplies, an argument which is highly contestable.((/ul))¶ The debates over the likely impacts of climate change have again popularised the idea of water wars. The argument runs that climate change will precipitate worsening ecological conditions contributing to resource scarcities, social breakdown, institutional failure, mass migrations and in turn cause greater political instability and conflict ([Brauch, 2002] and [Pervis and Busby, 2004]). In a report for the US Department of Defense, Schwartz and Randall (2003) speculate about the consequences of a worst-case climate change scenario arguing that water shortages will lead to aggressive wars (Schwartz and Randall, 2003, p. 15).

((/ul))The ever-increasing number of agencies on the ground, the difficulty of obtaining accurate intelligence, and the unpredictability of humanitarian crises make effective management and coordination extremely difficult. Solving this problem requires improved intelligence gathering and sharing, as well as tight management and coordination. 2. Political Dilemmas \"Sadako Ogata, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, crystallized the dilemma of the humanitarian alibi and of the United Nations, when it is held responsible for solving humanitarian crises such as that in Rwanda: ((ul))((hl))'No((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) international humanitarian ((/ul))((ul))((hl))organization((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) or NGO ((/ul))((ul))((hl))can solve political conflicts. ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))We need political will, the involvement of government and their leaders, of the U.N. and regional organizations, to maintain and build peace.'\"((/ul)) -- William Shawcross ((ul))((hl))The 'humanitarian alibi'((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) has been defined as \"((/ul))((ul))((hl))the misuse of the humanitarian idea((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) and humanitarian workers by governments eager ((/ul))((ul))((hl))to do as little as possible in economically unpromising regions((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) like sub-Saharan Africa.\"[2] ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Humanitarian aid gives the appearance that the international community is at least doing something, but \"((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))humanitarian intervention in the absence of a political solution solves nothing((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).\"[3] In the case of Sudan, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))relief efforts((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) have been called \"((/ul))((ul))((hl))an excuse to do nothing,\"((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) a result of the fact that the West has \"no great interest\" in political intervention to end the fighting.[4] ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Humanitarian aid((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))ensures((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))non-combatants are fed, sheltered, and healthy, but does not alleviate the violence around them((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), can lead to the \"specter of the well-fed dead.\" Even more disturbing, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the provision of humanitarian assistance can give non-combatants a mistaken sense of security((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) and protection by the international community, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))with tragic consequences.((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Humanitarian aid can prolong and fuel conflicts, ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))undermining its ultimate goal of saving lives: For fighting parties, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))aid can become a resource to be fought over((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). Aid leakage, or 'political taxation' of aid, refers to situations in which ((/ul))((ul))((hl))a portion of the aid goes directly to the fighting parties, who then use it themselves or sell it to buy weapons((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). Aid is fungible; because populations and ((/ul))((ul))((hl))troops are being fed by aid, fighting parties no longer have to worry about providing ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))for this need themselves ((/ul))((ul))((hl))and are ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))thus ((/ul))((ul))((hl))able to put more resources into fighting.((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Aid that helps only one side ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))in a conflict ((/ul))((ul))((hl))can fuel tensions and competition((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) between the sides. Simply ensuring equal distribution to different ethnic groups can reinforce divisions and 'labels' and make the groups less dependent on each other. ((/ul))A commonly cited example of aid perpetuating a conflict is that of Sudan, where civil war has lasted for well over a decade, and over two billion dollars have been spent on humanitarian aid. ((ul))Both rebel leaders and aid workers openly acknowledge that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))humanitarian aid((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), in addition to saving many lives, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))is a large factor in making it possible for the belligerent groups to continue fighting.((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Aid can create private incentives for continuation of the war((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), for example by paying relatively high wages to local people employed by aid agencies. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Imported food aid can undermine the local economy((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) and make an activity like agriculture less profitable. ((/ul))Solving these problems through aid conditionality carries the risk of harming the poorest and most vulnerable members of society. 'Smart aid' responds to this dilemma by applying the principle of conditionality to aid that is of greatest benefit to warlords and political leaders. Incursions on national sovereignty: Governments may refuse to allow humanitarian agencies to assist their citizens and may object to conditionality of aid and development assistance, citing defense of their national sovereignty. However, there is a growing acceptance of the changing norm of sovereignty to \"sovereignty as responsibility,\" which implies a government's responsibility for the well being of its citizens. 3. Criticisms of Humanitarian Organizations In Cambodia, UNTAC's 1991-93 20,000-person, multi-billion-dollar mission brought high inflation, social dislocation, and a large increase in prostitution and HIV/AIDS cases in Phnom Penh. In Afghanistan, Kabul rents have increased fivefold since the fall of the Taliban. The prices of staples such as rice have doubled, or even tripled, while most salaries have remained the same. ((ul))((hl))There is little accountability in the((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) humanitarian and ((/ul))((ul))((hl))development industry((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). There are no barriers to becoming an NGO and no comprehensive or enforceable performance standards for NGOs. Codes of conduct have been developed, such as the Red Cross Code of Conduct (1994), but compliance is voluntary. ((/ul))Because of the high staff turnover in humanitarian organizations and the different nature of conflicts in different countries, it is hard to build institutional memory to improve the efficiency of aid operations and to implement lessons learned. Competition for 'humanitarian market share.' The need to maintain a high profile in order to secure funding can influence NGOs' decision making, they cannot afford not to be seen at a disaster. This situation is aggravated by the impact of uneven media coverage of disasters. The dilemma of neutrality: The 1994 Code of Conduct of the International Federation of the Red Cross explicitly states that NGOs' work must be neutral. However, it is rare for the effects of aid to be neutral even if the provision of it is neutral. Furthermore, it is frustrating to give humanitarian aid to people without being able to protect their human rights. In working with the military, humanitarian agencies, especially NGOs, risk losing the neutrality that gives them their advantage. In addition, being associated with one side can endanger the work and the staff of NGOs. An influx of aid and aid workers can create huge interferences in the local economy. Services such as restaurants, hotels, and brothels tend to spring up as soon as a humanitarian or development operation begins. Houses are built in anticipation of the high rents that foreign aid agencies will pay and prices for commodities and rents inflate. ((ul))Lifestyle and budgeting issues: ((/ul))((ul))((hl))A lot of the money for aid programs((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), particularly with international organizations like the United Nations, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))goes toward staff salaries and technical requirements((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), rather than to the intended recipients of aid. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))This can create tensions((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) in relief programs. However, as aid workers often risk their lives in extremely difficult and stressful conditions, this is a difficult issue to resolve. ((/ul))Of two billion dollars spent on the UNTAC mission in Cambodia, most was spent on U.N. staff salaries (an estimated 118.5 million dollars) and travel costs (62 million dollars). Almost 9,000 new vehicles were purchased at a cost of approximately 81 million dollars, and all senior U.N. bureaucrats were given a daily hardship allowance of 145 dollars to supplement their salaries. At the time, the average annual income in Cambodia was 130 dollars. Problems with Development Assistance ((ul))Many of ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the challenges listed above for humanitarian aid apply equally to development assistance((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). There are also issues that apply exclusively to development assistance. ((/ul))1.((ul))((hl)) Development assistance is not designed to prevent conflict((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Development assistance can promote conflict((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) when it is administered without considering social and political conditions. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))It is very difficult to ensure ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the effects of ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))'apolitical' ((/ul))((ul))((hl))aid are((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) politically or ethnically ((/ul))((ul))((hl))neutral((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Problems arise primarily due to the institutional cultures((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) and organizational dynamics of donor agencies, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))which are not geared to dealing with the needs of deeply divided societies((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) Success is often measured in terms of the amount of money disbursed, rather than the outcome of programs. The mandate of these donor agencies is to promote economic growth and development \"without regard to political or other non-economic influences or considerations.\"[5] ((ul))((hl))Policies are aimed at improving overall macroeconomic stability((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) and economic growth, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))irrespective of potential income-distribution effects((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). However, as James Boyce writes, to concentrate solely on increasing the size of the economic pie, without considering how that pie is divided, is ((/ul))((ul))((hl))an approach \"singularly ill-suited to war-torn societies((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).\"[6] As all peace settlements are based on a balance of power between warring sides, any measure that disproportionately benefits or hurts one side can make both sides reassess their positions, with potentially catastrophic consequences for the peace.((/ul)) The policies of these lending agencies are based on neoclassical economic ideology and fail to take into account the needs of deeply divided and politically unstable societies. Policies such as liberalization of trade may cause short-term hardships such as increased unemployment, and through their uneven distributive effects can exacerbate cleavages between groups. Cutting government services to reduce budget deficits can weaken the social contract and the ties between citizens and government. Aid administered through government will favor those in power, while channeling aid in a way that bypasses central government can decrease a government's leverage, also causing problems. Lending agencies are gradually reforming to take into account lessons learned, and are forming conflict-prevention and post-conflict reconstruction units, as with the Conflict Prevention and Reconstruction Unit at the World Bank. Increasingly, agencies take into account the potential for conflict when designing their programs and adjust the programs accordingly. There are calls for projects to undergo conflict or ethno-national impact assessments (i.e., analyses of the affect of a proposed action on different ethnic or national groups and/or the conflict itself), in addition to the usual cost-benefit analysis. Another important measure is to involve these agencies more closely in the peace negotiations, as a means of bridging the gap between peace building and economic reconstruction and of improving overall coordination of post-conflict development. Bilateral development assistance also carries problems. Donor governments inevitably have competing multiple interests, only one of which is peace building. During the Cold War, geopolitical concerns were paramount. Economic and commercial interests are at stake, with roughly half of all bilateral aid tied to imports of goods and services from the donor country. ((ul))((hl))Inadequate funding mechanisms((/hl))((/ul))((ul)): Most donors award funding on a year-by-year basis, making forward planning very difficult for agencies. In general, each year's funding has to be used up before the next year's funding can be obtained, even if that money could be more usefully spent at a later date. In general, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the international community tends to take a fairly short-term view of post-conflict reconstruction((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), although in reality it takes years for reconciliation or refugee returns to occur. ((/ul))2. Aid Conditionality Although conditionality can be very effective, those enforcing it may face significant difficulties. Donors must coordinate so that they don't undermine each other. Alternative sources of revenue that might weaken donors' leverage, such as recipients' access to natural resources, must be cut off. The potential cost to more vulnerable members of society must be alleviated if necessary, through the use of 'smart sanctions' with humanitarian exemptions. Careful use of carrots and sticks can involve slicing the carrot -- providing aid in installments, to maintain leverage. 3. Efficiency and Effectiveness of Development Assistance ((ul))((hl))Development assistance may interfere with local capacities to deal with problems((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)).((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))This can make recipient countries dependent on aid, and encourage development techniques that are unsustainable((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) when foreign aid dries up.((/ul)) In addition, the most educated and capable members of the local population are often employed by foreign agencies, where they are paid high salaries to work as drivers, translators, or administrative staff. ((ul))((hl))As well as wasting valuable human capital and expertise, hiring these skilled people((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) for relatively low-level jobs ((/ul))((ul))((hl))detracts from local initiatives((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) to govern and develop.((/ul)) If local NGOs are encouraged to undertake development programs, they are often provided with monetary grants, encouraging more costly initiatives than are unsustainable in the long run. ((ul))Often, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))NGOs((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) will focus their resources on winning such grants, rather than helping the local communities. In addition, instead of working together to increase their effectiveness, they ((/ul))((ul))((hl))will be locked in competition against one another((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). What civil society initiatives really need is less expensive, long-term commitment.((/ul))"],"stats":{"highlightedWords":411}},{"tag":"NGOs fail in the Middle East","cite":"PATRICK COCKBURN 14, is the author of  Muqtada: Muqtada Al-Sadr, the Shia Revival, and the Struggle for Iraq, “How NGOs Failed Afghanistan”, https://www.counterpunch.org/2014/03/25/how-ngos-failed-afghanistan/","text":["I thought bitterly of the ((ul))((hl))torrent of aid((/hl))((/ul)) that had flowed into Afghanistan since 2001 – the latest figures give US non-military aid alone as $100bn (£61bn) – which ((ul))((hl))had done so little good((/hl))((/ul)) to Mr Qudus and millions of other Afghans. Some 60 per cent of Afghan children are stunted due to malnourishment and ((ul))((hl))only 27 per cent have access to safe drinking water((/hl))((/ul)). “Things may look all right to foreigners but in fact ((ul))((hl))people are dying of starvation((/hl))((/ul)) in Kabul,” Mr Qudus told me.

But the average lifespan of Afghans has risen from 45 years in 2001 to 62 today, an improvement due largely to a sharp drop in child mortality. In 2001, one in four Afghan children died before the age of five compared with one in 10 today. The reason for this dramatic progress is improved public health with better vaccination, midwifery and access to health care. Key to this development is $100m from USAID, so often the target of critics, without which the child mortality rate might have stayed where it was. “((ul))((hl))International aid” brings out the best and worst in people and institutions((/hl))((/ul)). It may be the occasion for ((ul))((hl))appalling corruption and wastefulness((/hl))((/ul)) or it can make the difference – as in the case of Afghan public health – between life and death for millions. There are aid workers who live a colonial lifestyle and never leave their offices, and others who show extraordinary skills and endurance. In the mid-1990s I came across a hospital in Iraqi Kurdistan, then sealed off from the outside world, which was supplying and fitting artificial limbs to people who had stepped on one of the millions of mines that littered the landscape. Villagers had been trying to make a little money to buy food by defusing mines and selling the explosives and the tin foil in which they were wrapped. Without the NGO-run hospital, few of these legless people would have survived. Likewise in 2001, life in the rebel-held Panjshir Valley was of medieval harshness, but at the bottom of the valley was a state-of-the-art Italian hospital. The picture is very varied. Wartime is not a good moment to start big long-term infrastructure projects. Insurgents know these are politically inspired and intended as a signal that the Afghan or Iraqi governments are doing something for their people. Naturally, they will try to sabotage such projects with mines, assassinations and general intimidation. An outstanding example of this in Afghanistan is the Kajaki hydroelectric dam on the Helmand River, originally completed by USAID as long ago as 1953, but needing a third turbine, ultimately brought in by British troops but never installed. The dam project is today the subject of an angry dispute between USAID, which is funding it, and the US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, John Sopko, who says it has become too expensive to be worthwhile. He says that in 2001 the scheme was expected to cost just $17m but this has since risen to $345m. These figures are vehemently contested by USAID. As Iraq and Afghanistan are two of the most crooked and dysfunctional states in the world, it is unlikely that international aid, along with everything else, will be untainted by corruption and incompetence. It does not have to be like this. Critics of non-governmental organisations and international aid in general will be glad to learn that there is one place in the world where the NGOs have been expelled and local people are running their own project. But the anti-aid lobby may be taken aback by the identity of those running the anti-NGO campaign. They are, in fact, al-Shabaab, the local affiliate of al-Qa’ida in Somalia, who control the Lower Shabelle province, now once again the bread basket of the country. Al-Shabaab has put $2m of its funds into a canal-building project that has brought prosperity to local farmers who no longer depend on the uncertain rains. “((ul))((hl))We want our people to be free of NGOs and foreign hands((/hl))((/ul)). ((ul))((hl))We want them to depend on each other and to stand free of outsiders((/hl))((/ul)),” Sheikh Abu Abdullah, the al-Shabaab governor of Lower Shabelle told al-Jazeera.

History also suggests that substan- tial US forces in the region are largely independent of energy security; the energy shocks of the 1970s were politically motivated, and even during the so-called tanker war the oil supply remained relatively secure throughout the light force posture period of the 1980s.26"],"stats":{"highlightedWords":68}},{"tag":"((hl))Solving existential risks is the dominant moral priority.((/hl))","cite":"((hl))Bostrom 12((/hl)) (Nick, Professor of Philosophy at Oxford, directs Oxford's Future of Humanity Institute and winner of the Gannon Award, Interview with Ross Andersen, correspondent at The Atlantic, 3/6, “We're Underestimating the Risk of Human Extinction”, http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/03/were-underestimating-the-risk-of-human-extinction/253821/)","text":["Bostrom, who directs Oxford's Future of Humanity Institute, has argued over the course of several papers that ((hl))human extinction risks are poorly understood and((/hl)), worse still, ((ul))((hl))severely underestimated by society((/hl))((/ul)).

Most worrying to Bostrom is the subset of existential risks that arise from human technology, a subset that he expects to grow in number and potency over the next century.¶ Despite his concerns about the risks posed to humans by technological progress, Bostrom is no luddite. In fact, he is a longtime advocate of transhumanism---the effort to improve the human condition, and even human nature itself, through technological means. In the long run he sees technology as a bridge, a bridge we humans must cross with great care, in order to reach new and better modes of being. In his work, Bostrom uses the tools of philosophy and mathematics, in particular probability theory, to try and determine how we as a species might achieve this safe passage. What follows is my conversation with Bostrom about some of the most interesting and worrying existential risks that humanity might encounter in the decades and centuries to come, and about what we can do to make sure we outlast them.¶ Some have argued that we ought to be directing our resources toward humanity's existing problems, rather than future existential risks, because many of the latter are highly improbable.

You might say that fundamentally it doesn't matter whether someone exists at the current time or at some future time, just as many people think that from a fundamental moral point of view, it doesn't matter where somebody is spatially---somebody isn't automatically worth less because you move them to the moon or to Africa or something((hl)).

For example, Trump’s national security strategy claims China is attempting to “challenge American power” by seeking “to pull the region into its orbit through state-led investment and loans((/hl))((/ul)).” Similarly, a recent National Endowment for Democracy report suggests the China-CELAC forum, which excludes the United States and Canada, is a “convenient policy framework to introduce and promote its soft power agenda.” Are they right, or are they missing some nuances? ((ul))((hl))Despite long-standing U.S. concerns about unfair trade competition, China’s approach is clearly built on multilateralism, free trade, and globalization((/hl))((/ul)) — values that previous Republican and Democratic administrations shared. Shoring up regional public goods like infrastructure may end up benefiting U.S. firms, making trade and investment easier. While China may be interested in geopolitical influence, it most certainly also has many commercial objectives in the region, including promoting new export markets, alleviating its domestic overcapacity and helping its companies globalize their operations by gaining cheap assets, market share, and key marketing, distribution, and engineering capabilities. But investing in soft power has had its down sides. It’s true that Latin American governments have flocked to Chinese capital, eager to address long-standing infrastructure deficits. But many Latin Americans have criticized China for its extensive promotion of Chinese firms, labor, and machinery within state-to-state investment contracts, and its lack of local governance standards, including inadequate environment and labor protections. But critics of Chinese investment in Latin Americas have failed to notice an important concern: not its current boom in investment, but a sudden bust. A boom may help the region develop; a bust could lead to another regional debt crisis. So will China lend prudently and foster its promised development, or instead lend too ambitiously and foment a bubble? How will China balance its investment risks? At times China has mispriced investment risk, and the country has lent defensively to absorb its bad investments. For example, China’s extended its loans to Venezuela for more than a decade during periods of volatility — first through the global financial crisis and then through the 2014 commodity downturn. But of course, Venezuela’s situation is deteriorating rather than improving. The country is struggling to repay its outstanding Chinese debts (totaling about $17 billion to $20 billion) amid its historic crisis and dwindling state-oil production. In response, ((ul))((hl))China has reportedly loosened the terms on some of Venezuela’s outstanding loans, allowing the country to pay interest only and defer its principle payments, and also the underlying collateral, removing minimum oil shipment quantities and extending repayment deadlines.((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))China has enough foreign reserves to absorb such losses, even beyond Latin American borders from Sri Lanka to Indonesia. How can it avoid such moral hazard problems and ensure successful investments in the future? China’s success in reaching its growth targets domestically during its miracle years revealed its ability to prosperously manage local investment projects. Can it also foster good governance internationally? Rather than imposing policy conditions, China increasingly tempers its state-to-state credit risks by diversifying its investments to include market-based instruments. For example, China has created private equity funds (e.g., China-LAC Cooperation Fund, China-Latin America Infrastructure Fund) that are investing in manufacturing, energy, logistics and even technology. It’s also participating in public private partnerships (PPP) and varying its project financing partners to include Chinese commercial banks, multilateral institutions (e.g. World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank) and local development banks.

((/ul))((ul))Refugees((/ul))((ul)) – like migrants in general – ((/ul))((ul))rarely count on institutional channels or jobs in the public sector((/ul))((ul)), where risk is not rewarded, and so are forced to innovate. The United States serves as a powerful example: ((/ul))((ul))Although the foreign-born represent only an eighth of the U.S. population, some 40 percent of Fortune 500 firms were founded by immigrants or their children. Over half of((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))U.S. start-up companies((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))valued at over $1 billion had at least one immigrant founder.((/ul))((ul)) Apple, Google, AT&T, Budweiser, Colgate, eBay, General Electric, IBM and McDonalds all owe their origin to a founder who was an immigrant or the child of an immigrant. ((/ul))((ul))The same is true ((/ul))((ul))((hl))in Brazil((/hl))((/ul))((ul)),((/ul))((ul)) where ((/ul))((ul))((hl))migrants were crucial to economic growth and innovation throughout the 20th century((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). Critics often retort that refugees may import terrorism and generate xenophobia. Again, the U.S. serves as a useful example: It has accepted 3 million refugees since 1975, yet none has been convicted of domestic terrorism. ((/ul))((ul))Xenophobia is extremely unlikely to become a serious problem in Brazil.((/ul))((ul)) Brazil is, like the U.S., a country built on the backs of hard-working people from Europe, Asia and Africa, and its rich history of recurrent waves of immigration from all over the world have turned it into a culturally and ethnically diverse melting pot that shaped its national identity (even though racism remains a problem). ((/ul))((ul))Brazil is home to more than 10 million people of Arabic descent, and many occupy leading positions in business and government – such as Temer himself((/ul))((ul)). In the university course I teach in São Paulo, my students' surnames point to ancestors from Japan, Hungary, Portugal, Italy, Germany, Lebanon, Syria and Spain – a degree of diversity comparable to any major US university. Yet ((/ul))((ul))((hl))today, Brazil is no longer an immigrant nation: In 1900, 7.3 percent of Brazil's population was made up of immigrants, while today's figure is a paltry 0.3 percent((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) and declining. During the military dictatorship, immigrants came to be seen less as an opportunity and more as a national security concern((/ul))((ul)), a notion that still influences the way the national bureaucracy deals with immigrants today. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Given how few foreigners now live in the country, Brazil, with a population of 200 million could, in theory, absorb a million foreigners or two without causing a surge of xenophobia – the foreign-born populations would still be remarkably low((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). Second, making a contribution on refugees would significantly boost Brazil's reputation abroad and help partially offset the negative image its current economic and political crisis generates. With governments in Europe and the Middle East desperate to deal with the situation, actively seeking to ((/ul))((ul))find ways to bring more refugees to Brazil could help the country in future negotiations with policy makers most affected by the crisis((/ul))((ul)) – particularly considering that the rise of populists across Europe, partly in response to the refugee crisis, can be seen as a major threat to stable democracy across the continent. Finally, ((/ul))((ul))as the world's seventh-largest economy,((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))Brazil no longer has the luxury to remain passive when it comes to facing the world’s most urgent global challenges.((/ul))((ul)) Whenever I make this argument, critics respond that since Brazil did not cause any war, it has no obligation to address its consequences. If applied to other global challenges such as climate change, this logic is dangerously simplistic and shortsighted, and will make meaningful international cooperation impossible. It also overlooks that ((/ul))((ul))even accepting 100,000 refugees over the next years would represent a mere 2 percent of Syrians who have fled their country – this would hardly put Brazil at the forefront of this global struggle.

What were some of the main drivers in play? And are you seeing more opportunities for a rebound in 2018? What are the biggest economic risks to Colombia in 2018? The Colombian economy grew 1.8% in 2017, slightly below the growth figure for 2016, or 2.0%. This digit was close to the one forecasted by the central bank’s technical staff months ago, 1.6%, and to the expectations by the majority of market analysts. The fall in the terms of trade since mid-2014 and the sharp slowdown or even contraction of the country’s main trading partners in the region have been the most important reasons behind the slower growth of the economy in the last few years, including 2017. Additionally, the Colombian economy continued to face some adverse transitory supply shocks. In 2017, the process of adjustment of expenditure continued after the huge negative shock to national income due to the fall of the international price of oil and other commodities exported by the country. While an increase in the terms of trade was reported in the same year, their levels remained significantly lower than those observed before 2014. Similarly, the adjustment of both public and private expenditure has taken place gradually in a less favorable external context. However, there has been a significant advance in this process, as suggested by the reduction of the external imbalance. For 2018, ((ul))((hl))the external and internal conditions are more favorable than in previous years, which allows to trust in an acceleration of growth. In its most recent projection, the technical staff of the central bank forecasts a growth figure of 2.7%,((/hl))((/ul)) and considers that, within a stable international economic context, it may continue to improve and converge towards potential growth in coming years. On the one hand, the average of international oil prices would increase again compared to the previous year, even after considering any foreseeable correction on its level in the coming months. Additionally, ((ul))((hl))the economies of the region begin to show signs of recovery, and advanced economies are at their best moment in the last ten years, which suggests that sectors such as non-traditional exports and services may gain momentum and help consolidate long-term growth. On the domestic front, the decline of inflation and the expansionary monetary policy should help to stimulate demand in the coming month((/hl))((/ul))s. In addition, investment in civil works announced by the government will continue to contribute significantly to growth, as happened in 2017. However, the possibility of a strong decline of oil prices by an excessive supply that may be deemed to be permanent may require greater and more prolonged adjustments in domestic spending besides those already foreseen. Likewise, the decisions on monetary, fiscal and trade policies that are being made in advanced economies must be considered. Particularly, those related to unforeseen changes in the U.S. Fed’s benchmark interest rate could cause increases in the volatility of financial markets as well as in the risk perception of the economies of the region, increasing the costs of the sources of funding.","s"],"stats":{"highlightedWords":103}}]
