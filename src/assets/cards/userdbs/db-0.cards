((/ul))((ul))¶((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))Certainly, presidents with an approval rating below 50 percent usually lose more than 30 seats in the House. That crash would be more than enough to produce a Democratic majority and thus would ensure an impeachment proceeding designed to paralyze the remainder of Trump’s first term. ¶ In the Senate, the Democrats have three times as many seats to defend (and lots of them in Trump-won states). Yet recently they are gaining confidence that they can flip enough races to deadlock or even win the Senate. The now-orthodox narrative about the midterm elections is increasingly hyped by the media as a “blowout” or “tsunami.” ¶ ((ul))((hl))Yet((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) the dilemma is not just that we are ten months out from the election((/ul)) and relative party popularity is already gyrating, ((ul))but that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))there are((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) lots of landmark ((/ul))((ul))((hl))developments((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) in play that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))we usually do not experience((/hl))((/ul)) in any midterm election. ¶ The ((ul))first, of course, is Trump and the polls. No one knows whether the “Trump phenomenon” of 3–5 percent underreporting in the polls is still valid.((/ul)) The Rasmussen poll has Trump at 45 percent, about 5 percent higher than the gold-standard RealClearPolitics average of 40 percent — analogous to the Election Day outlier and often-scoffed-at polls by USC/Los Angeles Times and Investor’s Business Daily/TIPP. Anecdotally, most can attest that colleagues and friends still usually look both ways before whispering, “Wow, Trump is doing great.” It may be a mass phenomenon that, for some, expressing hesitation about Trump or even virtue-signaling about his excesses serves as psychological penance for voting for him. ¶ Conventional wisdom trusts the 40 percent average; by 2016 unorthodox thinking, however, one might argue for the 45 percent outlier. But remember again, we are in surreal, even revolutionary, times when what is certain is now suspect, and what is absolutely impossible is feasible. ¶ ((ul))No one ever imagined that the take-the-knee NFL protests would have tanked viewership and attendance by over 10 percent((/ul)) and shaken the very foundations of a multibillion-dollar industry. ((ul))((hl))No one((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ever ((/ul))((ul))((hl))dreamed((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))that((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))many((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))in the illustrious liberal aparat ((ul))((hl))would be attrited((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) in just days ((/ul))((ul))((hl))by((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) long-known but suddenly disclosed ((/ul))((ul))((hl))creepy behavior((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) — John Conyers, Al Franken, Mark Halperin, Matt Lauer, Ryan Lizza, Charlie Rose, Jann Wenner, and Leon Wieseltier.((/ul)) We had never seen late-night television turn into nonstop political ranting. We have no idea whether comedians’ spiked ratings represent the new normal or have earned a quiet but simmering backlash. ¶ In short, ((ul))we have no idea whether the unprecedented hatred for a president,((/ul)) evident in mainstreamed assassination chic and 90 percent negative press coverage, ((ul))will reach a saturation point((/ul)) and turn off voters. Or will it create a pet-rocket/hula-hoop fad effect, where not voting for Trump becomes the correct, career-advancing, and socially acceptable act? ¶ ((ul))((hl))Nor does anyone fathom the effect of the booming economy on the((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))midterm((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) election((/ul)), especially an economy whose potential for rapid growth has not been seen in a generation. Conventional wisdom wars with itself. On the one hand, unpopular presidents usually lose the midterm elections. On the other, “It’s the economy, stupid” logic of 3 percent GDP growth undergirds a lot of political arithmetic. ¶ ((ul))We have never seen a stock market boom like the present one. Nor has the U.S. experienced all at once record gas and oil production, peacetime unemployment sinking to 4 percent or lower((/ul)), and near-record small-business and consumer confidence. ¶ ((ul))Is it more likely that current economic trends will peak and lead to stagnation or even a bust by November — or continue with even more robust growth? Was the U.S. economy under Obama sorely underperforming and psychosocially repressed((/ul))? And if so, do we really have any idea what the “animal spirits” of American entrepreneurialism are capable of when they are let loose — and are unabashedly praised rather than deprecated? ¶ ((ul))((hl))The new tax code((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) in the ensuing months might ((/ul))((ul))((hl))ensure more ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))take((/ul))((ul))-home ((/ul))((ul))((hl))pay((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) for the middle class and fatten further its 401K accounts((/ul)). If GDP growth increases and illegal immigration keeps falling, job growth among minorities may continue at near-record levels. An unprecedented economic boom might make anti-Trump voters simply stay home, to square the circle of publicly not liking Trump the messenger while privately very much liking Trump’s message. Or it could be that a 3 percent growth in annualized GDP won’t be enough for the controversial Trump; he might require 4 percent or even above for voters to value the economy over all other considerations. Trump’s recent bump in the polls occurred at a time of both strong economic news and an anti-Trump news blitz. ¶ ((ul))((hl))There are((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) other ((/ul))((ul))((hl))known unknowns((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))¶((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))First, ((ul))((hl))no one can foresee the((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ultimate ((/ul))((ul))((hl))results of the((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) warring ((/ul))((ul))((hl))investigations((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))by((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) Robert ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Mueller((/hl))((/ul))((ul))’s team and by the House Intelligence Committee.((/ul)) Will Mueller synchronize more indictments with the November elections and try to indict a Trump family member on some sort of financial impropriety or obstruction allegation? Would it even matter if the charge had little to do with Trump or Mueller’s original directive?¶ Or instead, ((ul))((hl))will we((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) finally ((/ul))((ul))((hl))learn the full story of the((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) Fusion GPS–((/ul))((ul))((hl))Steele dossier((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) and discover that the FBI and Justice Department, the outgoing Obama administration, a toadying media, and the Clinton campaign not only colluded in trafficking with Russian-supplied fibs and fantasies designed to cause chaos in the Trump campaign and transition, but also in many cases violated federal laws by((/ul)) using fraudulent materials to obtain FISA orders so they could improperly surveil U.S. citizens and then unmask and leak the names of those citizens (also illegally), and then use transcripts of such improper intercepts to cook up perjury charges against Trump associates? Could we go from a non-scandal to one of the greatest political scandals of the post-war era? Trump was once widely demonized for supposedly sloppily tweeting that Obama had “wire tapped” him. (“Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my ‘wires tapped’ in Trump Tower just before the victory.”) But in political terms, ((ul))what would happen over the next few months if it turned out that Trump was not only prescient but that he also understated the extent of the prior administration’s violations of civil liberties? ((/ul))((ul))¶((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))Like the economy, the political ramifications of the pseudo-collusion charges and the Steele dossier remain great unknowns. But in terms of momentum, the disclosures among Mueller investigators of improper workplace behavior, political biases, five months of “lost” text messages on FBI cellphones (coincidentally, texts that congressional overseers were seeking), and the failure to find clear evidence of collusion suggest that the team will become ever more eager to find something — anything — before the election, even as repulsion with the dossier scandal and its purveyors only grows. ¶ Second, ((ul))((hl))we cannot((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) yet ((/ul))((ul))((hl))calibrate((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) either ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the political fallout from the((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) recent government ((/ul))((ul))((hl))shutdown((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) (((/ul))and perhaps others to come in 2018) ((ul))((hl))or the consequences of((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Democratic gambit of((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) basing ((/ul))((ul))((hl))a((/hl))((/ul))((ul))n electoral ((/ul))((ul))((hl))campaign on((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))demonization of Trump((/hl))((/ul)), the supposed ogre.

((/ul))((ul))((hl))We can((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) probably ((/ul))((ul))((hl))agree((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))2018 will be ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))even more so((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul))((ul))¶((/ul)) So, as we pause for holidays, reflection and far too many refreshments -- pass the peppermint bark, stir the eggnog and bring on the apple pie -- let’s linger for just a moment on the questions being posed for next year:¶ Will the Trump boom persist?¶ No one, except perhaps Trump himself, predicted the magnitude of the economic surge, which his detractors -- somehow forgetting that Bill Clinton crowed about the economic recovery he inherited -- feel had little to do with the president. This is an eternal debate, never to be resolved. (Did John Kennedy produce the economic boom that began two weeks after he was inaugurated, or is that Dwight Eisenhower’s legacy?)¶ The one sure thing about booms is that they do not last.¶ Republicans are arguing that the tax cut they passed last week will extend the boom, maybe even boost the boom, but the public is skeptical; only a quarter of Americans, according to the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, consider the tax bill a good idea, as opposed to 41 percent who think it wasn’t.¶ Trump expressed an entirely different view on Twitter moments before final passage of the legislation: “This is truly a case where the results will speak for themselves, starting very soon. Jobs, Jobs, Jobs!”¶ Will Republicans reach some kind of political and cultural equilibrium?¶ Republicans have grown accustomed to what commentators inevitably call a “struggle for the soul of the GOP.” They had one in 1865, and again in 1952, and again in 1960, 1964, 1976, 1980 and 1992 -- a remarkable record of tumult for a party whose image is steadiness and stability.¶ This one is quite significant because unlike any of the seven previous struggles for the party’s soul, this is not only ideological and temperamental. It is also generational. Figures such as Bush and former Senate Majority Leaders Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee and Bob Dole of Kansas -- indeed, even the current GOP floor leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky -- are clearly figures from the Republican past.¶ ((ul))((hl))The future is((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) raucous, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))rancorous -- and ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))unpredictable((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).((/hl)) At stake here is the profile of the new GOP, the (dimming) prospects of bipartisan legislation, and the fate of House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, who in any case is no friend of the contentious Freedom Caucus, doesn’t like his job and deplores the difficult position it puts him in.¶ Which leads to the next vital question:¶ What are each party’s prospects in next year’s midterm congressional elections?¶ This is perhaps the greatest domestic uncertainty of the year. The Democrats harbor hopes of taking over the Senate, where Republicans hold a slim 51-49 advantage, and they take comfort from this month’s victory in the Alabama Senate race and from Trump’s low poll soundings, which show the president with an approval/disapproval rate of about 37 percent to 57 percent.¶ But here is a more sobering figure: Next year’s Senate elections involve 26 seats held by Democrats or independents loosely aligned with them and only eight seats held by Republicans. That’s a strong Republican advantage, with 10 of the Democratic seats being contested in states Trump carried last year.¶ At the same time, the entire House, now under Republican control, is up for grabs. House races tend to be local, affected only marginally by national factors, though Trump is so dominating a figure in the American imagination that Democrats inevitably will try to transform individual races into referenda on the president.¶ The first political test of the year, on March 13, is in southwestern Pennsylvania, a special election to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of GOP Rep. Tim Murphy. The 18th district of Pennsylvania is in many ways an enigma -- older and whiter than America as a whole, it has a Democratic registration advantage, but it delivered precisely 58 percent to both Mitt Romney in 2012 and Trump in 2016.¶ Those three ((ul))((hl))questions((/hl))((/ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((ul))((hl))-- about((/hl))((/ul)) what fate has in store for the economy, the Republican Party and ((ul))((hl))the midterm((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) congressional elections --((/ul)) ((ul))((hl))loom large((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) for next year((/ul)).

Some Democrats are now pushing for more robust messages constructed on specific policy differences with Republicans, in order to shift the battle lines for November 2018. According to a recent memo to the Democratic leadership by ((ul))Priorities USA (a top Democratic super PAC), public ((/ul))((ul))support for((/ul))((ul)) Trump's ((/ul))((ul))((hl))tax reform((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) law ((/ul))((ul))has gone up (Gallup recently found the same thing),((/ul)) ((ul))which ((/ul))((ul))((hl))could force Democrats to re-examine((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) their ((/ul))((ul))((hl))messaging((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) in the coming months.((/ul))¶ The Republican Party also must craft a more precise strategy that appeals to party loyalty, which has been somewhat inconsistent during Trump's first year in office. Republicans will have to motivate ardent Trump supporters to come out to the polls for GOP congressional candidates in 2018, rather than sitting back until 2020, when they can pull the lever again for Trump. The election will hinge on Republicans' ability to match or exceed Democrats' enthusiasm. The battle lines on the issues that will contribute to voter enthusiasm and, therefore, turnout, are slowly forming.¶ In each of the last three midterm elections -- 2006, 2010 and 2014 -- there has been a falloff of about 40 million voters compared with the prior presidential election.1 This has resulted in Republican base voters battling Democratic base voters in relatively small elections. A \"base\" or \"core\" voter is defined as one identifying with either the Democrats or the Republicans, with no leaning independents included. As recently as February of this year, Gallup tracking measured base Republicans as 25% of U.S. adults and base Democrats as 29%.¶ The lower voter turnout in midterm election years has produced three successive \"political revolutions.\" In 2006, Democrats sufficiently motivated their base voters to regain control of the U.S. House and Senate; in 2010, Republicans won back the U.S. House; and in 2014, the Republicans again gained control of the U.S. Senate. All of these outcomes came about with comparatively low voter participation.¶ ((ul))Democratic Party leaders and the national media have commented about how the Democratic base voter is currently angry and motivated to reverse the Trump administration's policies. They believe that a \"wave election\" is in the offing for November 2018.((/ul)) But how many fewer voters will there be in 2018 than in 2016 (139 million),1 and will the opposition party achieve a disproportionate turnout to overwhelm the incumbents?¶((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))A term used in psychology to((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))describe((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) positive or negative ((/ul))((ul))((hl))stimuli that affect behavior is \"valence((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).\" For example, anger toward the Trump administration has a negative valence, while support for Trump generally or on specific issues would have positive valences((/ul)). In essence, ((ul))both negative and positive emotions can cause behavior like \"bothering to vote\" in a nonpresidential election((/ul)). A midpoint word would be \"ambivalence,\" which is a conflict between positive and negative valence-carriers -- as in mixed emotions, inaction, gridlock or \"just not bothering to vote.\"¶ ((ul))Negative Valence Factors((/ul))((ul))¶((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))Gallup measures satisfaction and dissatisfaction with various government policy domains every January to coincide with the annual presidential State of the Union address to the U.S. Congress. Respondents are asked whether they are \"very satisfied,\" \"somewhat satisfied,\" \"somewhat dissatisfied\" or \"very dissatisfied\" with a number of specific aspects of the country and government policy.¶ ((ul))((hl))A gap ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))in satisfaction((/ul))((ul)) with the issues between the base voters of one political party and the base voters of the other ((/ul))((ul))((hl))could influence differences in((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) voter ((/ul))((ul))((hl))turnout((/hl))((/ul)) between the parties. The biggest impact is likely to come from a mismatch on the percentages who are \"very dissatisfied.\"¶ Given this, ((ul))a((/ul)) potential ((ul))strategy to drive up Democratic turnout would be to tap into the strong negative valences surrounding ((/ul))((ul))((hl))income inequality,((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) efforts to deal with ((/ul))((ul))((hl))poverty, gun control, corporate power, race relations and((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) affordable ((/ul))((ul))((hl))healthcare((/hl))((/ul)). As seen in this table((hl)), ((/hl))((ul))((hl))at least four in 10 Dem((/hl))((/ul))((ul))ocrat((/ul))((ul))((hl))s are ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))very dissatisfied((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))with ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))each((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))of these issues,((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))and Democrats have more than a 20-point edge over Republicans in extreme dissatisfaction on ((/ul))((ul))each((/ul))((ul)).((/ul))¶ ","","On the Republican side of the equation, just one negative valence issue is evident in the January poll, but it's a key one: immigration. It carries a strong negative valence for Republicans, as 42% are very dissatisfied with the current level of immigration, more than 20 points higher than Democrats, at 20%.¶((ul)) ((/ul))Positive Valence Factors¶ ((ul))In terms of any grand strategy ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the Republican Party might use((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) in the midterm elections, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the economy ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))and((/ul))((ul)) economic opportunity more broadly have positive valences with Republicans ((/ul))((ul))((hl))and((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) may ((/ul))((ul))((hl))encourage((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) GOP ((/ul))((ul))((hl))turnout((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) Republicans are largely content about the state of the country and may want to vote to \"let the good times roll.\"¶ Additionally, 26% of Republicans are very satisfied with the economy, and a combined 81% are at least somewhat satisfied. At the same time, Democrats are fairly neutral on the economy, with equal numbers satisfied (50%) and dissatisfied (49%), and only 6% very satisfied. Thus, most of the intensity on this key pocketbook election issue is with the GOP.¶ Gallup News Alerts¶ Gallup News Alerts¶ Get the latest data-driven news delivered straight to your inbox.¶ Possible Nonissues¶ Several other policy evaluations -- shown in the following table -- could conceivably affect the 2018 elections, but probably won't because partisan attitudes largely offset each other. In other words, given equal intensity toward each issue, the Republican and Democratic base voters could cancel each other out, positive versus negative, to near zero. This issue set includes the environment, business regulation and energy policy.¶ The second category of issues that might not come into play in the 2018 midterm elections would be those on which both political parties' base voters express similar levels of satisfaction and, therefore, lack the large spatial difference to create a higher turnout for one party. These include anti-terrorism efforts and military preparedness, about which majorities of both parties are broadly satisfied, as well as education and abortion, about which half or more in each party are broadly dissatisfied.¶ Bottom Line¶((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))Given the political parties' limited time and resources, to make their points, each will most likely target only two compelling messages for their national battle plan. The economic outlook issue is usually front and center in every campaig((/ul))n, and as of today, the advantage on the economy seems to be with the Republicans for 2018.¶ ((ul))The ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Dem((/hl))((/ul))((ul))ocrat((/ul))((ul))((hl))s((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))have ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))more messaging energy((/hl))((/ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((ul))((hl))from((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))traditionally((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))secondary topics like((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) policies for the poor, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))race relations and income((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) distribution((/ul)).

On paper, well-off suburban families—at least those outside of high-tax states like New Jersey, New York, and California—stand to gain the most from the legislation. The bill lowers their overall tax rate, doubles the standard deduction for families, and increases the child tax credit. But a new Monmouth poll shows the plan polls particularly poorly with the highest earners (those making over $100,000 a year), with just 28 percent of respondents favoring the plan and 47 percent disapproving.

That support, he said, should help Republican House and Senate candidates running this fall on conservative leaning terrain. \"Because of redistricting, Americans live in two incredibly separate worlds, Republican [Congressional Districts] versus Democratic CDs,\" McInturff said. \"To sustain a majority in the House, tracking Trump's approval in GOP CDs may be more important than ...

","California, Colorado, Connecticut, Idaho, Maryland, New York, Vermont and other states with their own exchanges saw enrollment approach or surpass 2017 levels. ","Minnesota’s health insurance exchange set a record for private plans with an enrollment period that was more than two weeks shorter than in 2017. ","California’s state exchange, the nation’s largest, has reported more than 1.2 million renewals for 2018 and an additional 342,000 new customers.

","Crow has criticized Coffman’s vote for the GOP tax bill, which eliminated the tax penalty for people who don’t get health insurance. That move is expected to undermine the individual insurance market starting next year. ","More than 22,000 people enrolled last year for coverage on the state exchange in Coffman’s district, which went for Hillary Clinton in 2016. ","“People in our district recognize the progress we’ve made under health care. The fact that 20 million more people have health care matters — it matters a lot,” Crow said. “And under Trump, we are now moving in the opposite direction.” ","Coffman encountered hoots and boos at town halls last year for his insistence that Obama’s health law be repealed, even though he eventually voted against the legislation. He insists that any replacement guarantee coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. ","Coffman’s campaign manager, Tyler Sandberg, described the incumbent’s approach to health care as nuanced. ","“His stance ultimately is about pre-existing conditions. It’s something everyone can relate to,” Sandberg said. “And if Democrats think they can hit him over the head with it, I think they’re going to be sorely mistaken.” ","Democrats also are making health care a key part of their strategy in this year’s race to select a successor to Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper. The Democrat last year worked with moderate Republican Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, lobbying Congress in an unsuccessful attempt to maintain the requirement that all Americans have health insurance. ","A Republican field that includes former Rep. Tom Tancredo and Attorney General Cynthia Coffman is focusing on roads, education, immigration and spending limits. The Democrats, including Lt. Gov. Donna Lynne, a longtime health care executive, and U.S. Rep. Jared Polis, have made protecting the state exchange a central campaign theme. ","Safeguarding the Obama-era health care reforms is essential to Colorado voters such as Draut, 45, who said her state exchange policy gives her peace of mind that she’ll be covered if she becomes ill, and Caleb Jackson, a 27-year-old graduate student at the University of Colorado-Denver. ","Under the Affordable Care Act, Jackson was covered until last year on his parents’ policy, which allowed him to receive a $200,000 bone marrow transplant that stabilized a debilitating neurological condition.

The wage growth is truly impressive …","… employers are giving more benefits to employees, they’re hiring more people, they are more opportunities … This result is what matters most.

The rest of their party in Washington, for now, is more focused on Trump's policy and the coming midterm elections.¶ When Trump fired his FBI Director, a number of Democrats used the word \"impeachment\" and David Gergen, the noted former aide to both Republican and Democratic presidents said, \"we're in impeachment territory now.\"¶ ((ul))((hl))The idea of impeachment ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))split Democrats((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) in June when Sherman and Greene first brought it up. Democrats in the House sparred privately over the issue during a closed-door meeting in June((/ul)), according CNN's Deirdre Walsh, who reported at the time that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi was wary of Democrats getting out front of the issue instead of letting the investigation unfold.¶ Sherman and Green have not gained any compadres in their effort during the intervening month despite a whirlwind of developments in the ongoing saga of possible collusion between people associated with the Trump campaign and Russians.¶ The latest, and by far most explosive development, came when the President's son, Donald Trump Jr., released emails ahead of publication of a New York Times story that made clear he was excited to take a meeting with Russian lawyer on the understanding that she could provide information and documents damaging to the Clinton campaign and provided, according to the emails, by the Russian government.¶ ((ul))No definite collusion has been shown, but the emails, which were uncovered by the legal team of the President's son-in-law, are symptomatic of how special counsel investigations can work.((/ul))((ul))¶ ((/ul))George Stephanopoulos, who is now a journalist for ABC News but during the 1990s was a top aide to Clinton, told CNN's Axe Files podcast recently that the Trump White House will be surprised at what it's like to work under the cloud of a special counsel investigation.¶ \"Having worked in a White House that was under the thumb of the special counsel for several years, they have no idea,\" Stephanopoulos said.¶ The special counsel can also veer in wildly different directions if it finds evidence of new wrongdoing.¶ Stephanopoulos pointed out that Starr first got to work on his investigation \"before (intern) Monica Lewinsky came into the White House.\"¶ \"That's (Lewinsky) what ended up being what Bill Clinton got impeached over,\" he noted. \"Special counsels can go in any direction they want.\"¶ It's not clear that Mueller will find himself so far afield. Starr was appointed under a law that has now lapsed by a three-judge panel. Mueller was appointed by acting Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.¶ Mueller was tasked with investigating:¶ any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump; and¶ any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation; and¶ any other matters within the scope of 28 C.F.R. § 600.4(a).¶ That last one, by the way, is shorthand in legalese for: \"the authority to investigate and prosecute federal crimes committed in the course of, and with intent to interfere with, the special counsel's investigation, such as perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, and intimidation of witnesses; and to conduct appeals arising out of the matter being investigated and/or prosecuted.\"¶ And that's how Starr got from a land deal to obstruction of justice, perjury and Clinton's relationship with Lewinsky.¶ So ((ul))Mueller can look at possible collusion, other crimes he might uncover and any lying or obstruction connected with his investigation.((/ul))((ul))¶ ((/ul))((ul))Starr began his tenure as special counsel in 1994 investigating the Whitewater land deal. He ended up recommending the President be impeached for lying and obstruction of justice in 1998.((/ul))((ul))¶ ((/ul))It took him about four years to release the Starr report.

In fact, his expertise in constitutional law — as well as his outsized voice opposing the Clinton impeachment in 1998 — was a factor in his selection to lead committee Democrats. While he says impeachment would surely be on the table in a Democrat-led House, it's far from certain it would be the right call — politically or constitutionally. And it'll be up to his committee to tell voters why. \"If we were in the majority and if we decide that the evidence isn't there for impeachment — or even if the evidence is there we decide it would tear the country apart too much, there's no buy-in, there's no bipartisanship and we shouldn't do it for whatever reason — if we decide that, then it's our duty to educate the country why we decided it,\" Nadler said in an interview. It's a risky proposition with an animated Democratic base demanding the party's leaders use the full range of their powers to target Trump. And some of that pressure is coming from within. \"I think a lot of the base would push strongly for impeachment. I think many of us feel like the lines have been crossed,\" said Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), who supports impeaching Trump. The debate is roiling House Democrats, with progressives forcing a debate over the issue even as vulnerable incumbents, particularly members in districts that favored Trump, worry it could jeopardize their future in Congress. Earlier this month, 58 House Democrats led by Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) — nearly a third of their caucus — voted to begin debate on articles of impeachment against Trump, despite calls by Democratic leadership to spike the measure. And now those on the other side of the debate are already fretting about how far their colleagues and the Democratic base will try to take the issue ahead of the midterms. “I realize that maybe I’m in the minority in our party,” said Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.), one of 12 Democrats from a district Trump won in 2016, who opposes impeachment. “I know there are contrary views, obviously, with Al Green forcing us to vote on something that I think was entirely unnecessary and hurtful to people in certain districts.” ((ul))Democrats((/ul)) like Bustos say they ((ul))are waiting for the outcome of a special counsel investigation into Trump associates' ties to Russia((/ul)), which has raised the specter of indictments in Trump's inner circle and even an obstruction of justice charge against the president himself. Other Democrats say the president's handling of race issues and business conflicts of interest already present grounds for impeachment. But Huffman acknowledged that ((ul))((hl))most members ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))of the Democratic caucus ((/ul))((ul))((hl))aren't there((/hl))((/ul))((hl)) ((/hl))yet, and he says ((ul))many are nervous about the prospect of provoking a political backlash((/ul)), as Republicans did after impeaching Clinton. \"I think ((ul))((hl))there'll be a lot of nervousness((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) about not repeating that mistake,\"((/ul)) Huffman said. \"As someone who favors impeachment, I feel strongly it needs to be bipartisan. I think that's one of the things Republicans got wrong in '98. The bipartisan piece of it is assurance to the public that you're not just playing partisan games. We're a long way from Republicans joining us.\" Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), who has filed his own articles of impeachment against Trump, said he understands why some Democrats are reluctant to join the effort right now. But he said it would be a mistake to compare Trump and Clinton. “There’s a difference between colluding with Russia to win an election and obstructing justice ... and having a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky,\" Cohen said. Still, ((ul))some Democrats are trying to urge caution even as their liberal colleagues move full steam ahead. Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) acknowledged the \"enormous antipathy\" for Trump in the Democratic base but said impeachment must be treated as \"a last resort remedy.\"((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))“Winning the House shouldn’t be seen as a referendum one way or the other on the question of impeachment. To insist otherwise calls into question the credibility of the entire effort,” Connolly said. “I think that is a huge mistake and a pitfall at all costs to be avoided.” Connolly said if Democrats retake the House and decide to consider impeachment, they must prioritize \"a fact-based process\" that persuades non-Democrats of their course. \"I don't take an oath to Tom Steyer or anyone else,\" he said. \"I take an oath to the Constitution of the United States, and this is a constitutional process.\" ((ul))Several Democrats also noted that it makes little sense to pursue impeachment without Republican buy-in because the process would then surely be stopped cold in the Senate. The House requires a simple majority vote to impeach a president, but removal from office requires a two-thirds vote after a trial in the Senate — a threshold that Democrats are certain to be well short of in the next Congress.((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))Nadler argued that it makes little sense to pursue a partisan impeachment under those conditions. Huffman, though, said he disagreed, calling the House and Senate processes \"apples and oranges.\" It's one of many thickets Democrats will have to wade through if they retake the House.

Donald Trump is president? It seems like something out of a dystopian film. But it’s not science fiction; it’s reality. Exactly a year ago today, the voters of America, in their dubious wisdom, choose the reality TV star and real estate mogul as our 45th chief executive. I, like most people — including probably Trump himself — was shocked by the outcome. Actually “shocked” is far too mild a word for what I felt. Poleaxed is more like it. I went to bed late on the evening of Nov. 8, 2016, in a daze, incredulous that my fellow citizens could elect a man so unqualified for the presidency and fearful of what he would do in office. ((ul))((hl))The past year has been((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) both ((/ul))((ul))((hl))better((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) and worse((/ul)) ((ul))((hl))than((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) I ((/ul))((ul))((hl))anticipated((/hl))((/ul)). It has been better in that ((ul))((hl))Trump has not((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) actually ((/ul))((ul))((hl))carried out((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) most of ((/ul))((ul))((hl))his lunatic((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) campaign ((/ul))((ul))((hl))rhetoric. He has not((/hl))((/ul)) ordered the torture of terrorist suspects. He has not ((ul))((hl))pulled out troops((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) from Japan, South Korea, or Germany((/ul)) even though those countries have not increased their subsidies for U.S. protection. ((ul))He has not ((/ul))((ul))((hl))launched a trade war((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) with China((/ul)) even though our trade deficit with China has only grown over the past year. He has not tried seriously to get Mexico to pay for his border wall; even Congress is unlikely to fund it. He has not lifted sanctions on Russia or reached a grand bargain with Russian President Vladimir Putin. He has not “locked up” Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. He has pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Paris climate accord, and he decertified the Iranian nuclear deal, but NAFTA is still standing — for now. He has moved us closer to war with Iran and North Korea, but the bombs haven’t started falling — yet. Trump supporters can argue that ((ul))((hl))he is more moderate in practice((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) than his rhetoric would suggest((/ul)). There’s an element of truth in this, but the more compelling explanation for his failure to make good on his promises is threefold. First, ((ul))((hl))Trump doesn’t((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) really ((/ul))((ul))((hl))believe in much((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) beyond his own awesomeness((/ul)). He didn’t run for office to get anything done; he ran to stoke his own ego and pad his own bank account by increasing his visibility. Thus he would say outrageous stuff on the campaign trail, contradict himself 30 seconds later, and immediately segue to some non sequitur. ((ul))((hl))He didn’t mean ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))a lot of ((/ul))((ul))((hl))what he said((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) — it was just something to rouse the rubes at rallies. ((/ul))Second, ((ul))((hl))Trump has been ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))utterly ((/ul))((ul))((hl))incompetent. Even if he wants to achieve more((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) of his agenda, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))he doesn’t know how((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) to do it((/ul)). As Daniel Dale of the Toronto Star puts it, ((ul))he “talks like a strongman” but governs like a “weak man.”((/ul)) Maybe tax reform will get done — maybe — but so far he hasn’t signed a single major piece of legislation. Actually that’s not quite true: Congress did pass a law strengthening sanctions against Russia over the administration’s protests. Aside from a Supreme Court appointment, the only things Trump has succeeded in accomplishing are those he can do by executive order, thus doing on a far larger scale what he once criticized Obama for. The third reason why ((ul))((hl))Trump((/hl))((/ul)) has gotten so little done ((ul))((hl))is((/hl))((/ul)) that he’s ((ul))((hl))surrounded by people who,((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) by and large, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))don’t share his((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) xenophobic, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))isolationist, protectionist((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) “America First” ((/ul))((ul))((hl))outlook((/hl))((/ul))((hl)). ((/hl))((ul))((hl))Most of those who did((/hl))((/ul)) — Michael Flynn, Steve Bannon, Sebastian Gorka — ((ul))((hl))have been forced out((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) because they were incompetent((/ul)) crackpots. Lacking any interest in ideas, Trump has staffed his administration with people based largely on superficial criteria such as appearance. That helps to explain why ((ul))most of his senior appointees,((/ul)) including Rex Tillerson, James Mattis, John Kelly, H.R. McMaster, and now Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chairman, look ((ul))as if they are straight out of central casting.((/ul)) It also explains why former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton didn’t snare a job: Trump was said not to like his mustache. As a result, ((ul))Trump is surrounded by ((/ul))((ul))((hl))aides((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) who ((/ul))((ul))((hl))view him as a screwball to be contained, not a sage to be followed.((/hl))((/ul)) So does that mean Trump’s presidency has been just swell, as his fans claim? Not at all. In important respects, Trump has been worse than I imagined. If the past year has done anything, it has dispelled naive hopes that he would grow in office or become more presidential. He’s the same old Trump that he was for the previous 70 years: ignorant, petulant, unethical, avaricious, conspiratorial, nasty, shameless, bullying, egomaniacal. One of the salient features of his presidency has been its lack of ethics. His former campaign manager Paul Manafort has been indicted on charges of money laundering, and former national security advisor Michael Flynn is said to be on the verge of indictment for acting as an unregistered foreign agent. Many of the president’s men, and even the president himself, had undisclosed business dealings with Russia, ranging from Trump’s attempts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow during the campaign to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross’s continuing investment in a shipping firm closely tied to the Kremlin. Trump and his aides, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions, have also consistently lied about their dealings with Russia. Former Trump foreign-policy advisor George Papadopoulos pled guilty to deceiving the FBI about his Kremlin ties; others may follow. Russia aside, Trump uses his office to promote his own properties in violation of the emoluments clause of the Constitution. He has refused to disclose his tax returns as every president has done more than 40 years. And while private-sector figures from Harvey Weinstein to Michael Oreskes are being fired for sexual harassment, the president remains in office despite credible accusations of misconduct from at least 16 women. Trump himself basically admitted to the allegations in his infamous “grab ‘em by the pussy” video, but now the White House press secretary shamefully labels his accusers as liars. The real liar, of course, is Trump himself. According to the Washington Post, during his first 263 days in office, he made 1,318 false or misleading claims. That’s an average of five falsehoods a day.

Nixon sought to subvert the rule of law in private. Trump does it out in the open for all to see. It has become routine for the president to demand criminal investigations of his political opponents based on, so to speak, trumped-up charges (Donald Trump Jr. even accuses the Clintons of murder); to call for the broadcast licenses of critical media outlets to be revoked; to attack the special counsel investigating him; to impugn the FBI, the judiciary, and the Justice Department; and to suggest that his own attorney general should resign for not doing his political bidding. Granted, most of these threats have been empty ones — but not all. Trump did fire FBI Director James Comey in a blatant attempt to obstruct justice. Moreover, his very words — coming from the man charged with ensuring “that the laws be faithfully executed” — corrode trust in our legal system. When Trump is not undermining the rule of law, he is demeaning the presidency and embarrassing the country. Trump uses Twitter to carry out unseemly vendettas against Gold Star parents, the mayors of London and San Juan, lawmakers from “Liddle” Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) to “Pocahontas” Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), journalists from those at the “failing New York Times” to “Crazy” Mika Brzezinski, and an endless array of other targets, many of them women and minorities. Trump’s tweets are frequently vituperative and full of errors in spelling and grammar. They sound as if they are coming from a mental institution, not from the White House. What most troubles me about Trump’s presidency is the extent to which he is dividing Americans by race and ethnicity in service to his own political ambitions. Having won with overwhelming support among white, working-class voters, Trump notoriously hesitates to criticize white supremacists: He thought there were “very fine people” on both sides at the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, and he has defended Confederate statues as part of “our heritage.” When white killers go on a rampage, as they did recently in Las Vegas and Sutherland Springs, Texas, Trump labels it a tragedy about which there is little to be done beyond “thoughts and prayers.” By contrast, he exploits every terrorist act committed by a Muslim, such as the Halloween attack in New York, labeling the perpetrators “animals” and calling for Draconian immigration restrictions. He has gone on an extended tirade against the African-American football players who kneel when the national anthem is played to protest police brutality. He has pardoned racist former Sheriff Joe Arpaio. And he has revoked the executive order that former President Barack Obama used to protect “Dreamers” — immigrants brought to America illegally as children — from deportation. Sadly, other Republican office-seekers, such as gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie in Virginia and Senate candidate Roy Moore in Alabama, have imitated Trump’s noxious example by seeking to rally white voters with blatantly racial appeals. Gillespie failed, but that won’t stop other Trump imitators from trying their luck. Trump took a divided nation and instead of trying to heal those divisions, he has exacerbated them. A Boston Globe reporter who traveled to York County, Pennsylvania, an area that Trump won, found that “the class resentments, racism, and xenophobia that became flashpoints during the election have hardened, not healed.” And that’s what Trump has done in just the year since he won the presidency. Imagine what the next three years — or, God forbid, the next seven years — will hold.

The very fact that much of his misconduct is now so routine that it’s hardly noteworthy indicates his success in, as former Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) put it, “defining deviancy down.” Far from making America “great again,” he is reducing a once-great country to his tawdry level."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":99}},{"tag":"Congress will prevent any radical change to foreign policy towards Russia or China ","cite":"L.

Under his leadership, the committee could use its oversight authority to review Iran’s implementation of the nuclear accord.","On the appropriations side, Rep. Kay Granger is likely to continue to seek decreased spending on foreign assistance. The geographic distribution of foreign assistance funds is heavily concentrated in Africa, particularly throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, and in parts of Southwest and Southeast Asia. The House Appropriations bill set funding levels for FY 2017 at $595 million below FY 2016 and $691 million below the President’s budget request.","President-elect Trump has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin for his strength and leadership. He has stated that German Chancellor Angela Merkel is his favorite world leader, but he nonetheless criticized her for allowing a large number of refugees into her country (476,000 Syrian refugees received asylum in Germany in 2015). ","President-elect Trump, in addition to being critical of other North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries’ support levels, has said he would like to see NATO’s priorities shift away from Russian deterrence toward combating international terrorism and migration. A Republican Congress is not likely to support the President-elect’s threat of withdrawal from NATO, but Republican leaders could take a closer look at the balance of indirect spending among NATO partners.","Syria.

The conflict in Syria is likely to continue to force Russia and the US to the negotiating table again, with world leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande, who are pressing for a ceasefire.

In 1973, Anthony Lake and Leslie H. Gelb wrote a fascinating essay for this magazine titled “Watergate and Foreign Policy,” which outlined all the ways that scandal would influence Nixon’s foreign policy. Much of what they warned about happened, and all of it applies today.","Because Trump will have less time to focus on pursuing his foreign-policy agenda, the foreign-policy bureaucracy will have incentive to be more resistant than usual to dictates from Trump-appointed leaders, while bureaucratic entrepreneurs will have an invitation to expand their power and influence (as Henry Kissinger did under Nixon). Meanwhile, ((ul))congressional Republicans, sensing the White House’s weakness, will be ((/ul))((ul))less likely to approve funding for Trump’s pet foreign-policy projects((/ul))((ul)), like a ((/ul))((ul))350-ship Navy((/ul)) or a border wall with Mexico.

The most alarming and potentially consequential foreign-policy change since Jan. 20 has been the Trump administration’s rhetorical approach to North Korea. After promising that the administration would “have no further comment,” senior officials made a series of escalatory demands on Kim Jong Un’s nuclear and missile programs and imposed a timeline for action on the United States by declaring “the clock has now run out” and “this problem is coming to a head.”","While telegraphing its desire to instigate a crisis with North Korea, the Trump administration has publicly articulated no plan or theory of success for how the “denuclearization” of the Korean Peninsula actually happens. And in conversations with White House, Pentagon, and State Department officials and staffers about North Korea, I have heard nothing that indicates such a plan exists. The default course of action — tried unsuccessfully by the last two presidents — is to further lean on Beijing to further lean on Pyongyang. This will not work. Two weeks ago, I was fortunate to attend a workshop in Beijing, where a well-connected Chinese foreign-policy scholar stated bluntly: “You have to understand, China is more afraid of the United States than it is of North Korea.” He further indicated that China’s leaders prefer the status quo of a nuclear-armed North Korea over working with the United States to further destabilize, or even topple, the Kim regime.","When China inevitably refuses to coerce North Korea as strongly, or on the timeline, that the Trump administration demands, then what? If the White House believes that North Korea has even a 10 or 20 percent probability of being able to successfully launch an intercontinental ballistic missile mated with a nuclear warhead onto the United States, I believe that Trump would authorize a preemptive attack against the missile-launch site (assuming it is an easily observable, liquid-fueled missile) and perhaps against known nuclear weapons-related facilities.","Military officials, including Adm. Harry Harris, commander of the U.S. forces in the Pacific, have acknowledged that Kim would not simply absorb such an attack but would immediately retaliate against South Korea. This would trigger America’s mutual defense treaty commitments to defend South Korea and spark a series of classified, pre-planned U.S.-South Korean military operations. When the Pentagon reviewed some version of this scenario in 1994 (before North Korea had a nuclear arsenal of at least a dozen bombs), it was estimated that such a retaliation could “cause hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of casualties.”","But ((ul))a President ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Trump facing((/hl))((/ul)) ever-expanding scandals, continually low polling numbers, and even ((ul))potential ((/ul))((ul))((hl))impeachment((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) proceedings((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))may decide((/hl))((/ul)) that ((ul))((hl))a preemptive attack on North Korea ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))is ((/ul))((ul))worth the costs and consequences((/ul)).

The words have become such a relentless Trump mantra, day after day, week after week, like a nervous tick, that they inevitably summon Shakespeare’s trenchant insight from Hamlet, “The lady doth protest too much.”","The persistent and by now gratuitous denials come from a President who is unable or unwilling to distinguish truth from fiction, who dishes out falsehoods as a daily ritual, whose gluttony and compulsive behavior suggest (in the words of a psychiatrist I respect) “a complete lack of impulse control,” and who, by the shocking account of Michael Wolff’s new book, Fire and Fury, as well as many others, doesn’t read memos, can hardly be briefed, is overwhelmed by an office he was not expecting to win, and is losing what grasp he had of reason and reality.","In short, we may be approaching in the second year of the 45th president a situation as volatile and dangerous as the final days of the 37th president. For all his legendary faults—his greed for power, his paranoia, his bitterness and vindictiveness—((ul))((hl))Nixon((/hl))((/ul)) was ((ul))((hl))at least((/hl))((/ul)) a deeply experienced and knowledgeable president, both in domestic and foreign affairs, and he ((ul))((hl))understood the((/hl))((/ul)) awesome ((ul))destructive ((/ul))((ul))((hl))power of nuc((/hl))((/ul))((ul))lear weapon((/ul))((ul))((hl))s.

And he may have learned the wrong lesson from his (to my view well justified) April 2017 launch of 59 cruise missiles to punish the Syrian regime for its use of chemical weapons. That brought no serious military retaliation against the United States. An attack on North Korea would involve very different stakes on both sides.","((ul))((hl))As 2018 unfolds((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))domestic and international dimensions of Trump’s((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) crisis-ridden ((/ul))((ul))((hl))presidency are beginning to intersect((/hl))((/ul)) in wildly unpredictable and potentially disastrous ways. There are signs of preparations for a U.S. military attack on North Korea by mid-year, and a new report by a leading Russian expert on North Korea indicates that the Pyongyang regime “is convinced that the U.S. is preparing to strike.” This would likely be not a full-scale military assault to terminate the North Korea’s tyrannical regime but rather a punishing “bloody nose” strike, either to send a message about American resolve to halt further testing and development of Kim Jong Un’s nuclear weapons program or to actually destroy as much of its existing infrastructure as possible.","While every American would like to be rid of the nuclear threat from the world’s last totalitarian regime, the risks of a military strike are enormous. They involve not only the possibility of massive North Korean retaliation against South Korea (and against American military installations in South Korea and Japan, where a total of more than 50,000 American troops are based), but also a military confrontation with China, which is ramping up its own military preparations in response to the growing signs of the U.S. military planning for an assault. Moreover, the attack would likely be seen by most of the world as an unprovoked act of “preventive war,” and one that would be launched before diplomatic options had clearly been exhausted (as they have hardly yet been adequately pursued). This would leave the U.S. diplomatically isolated and viewed by most of the world as responsible for death and destruction on a massive level. A diplomatic breakthrough to freeze and contain North Korea’s program before it can hit the U.S. may still be possible, and Trump is now all of a sudden signaling openness to diplomacy. But it is hard to see this as anything more than the president’s notorious unpredictability. As the Wall Street Journal observed in reporting his new signal, “Mr. Trump has vacillated between seeming open to—and even eager for—diplomacy with North Korea, and dismissing the need or value for it.”","Then there is the looming domestic political crisis. What signal was the President sending when he told the New York Times in December, “I have absolute right to do what I want to do with the Justice Department”? And what are we to make of the gathering drumbeat of demands from conservative media figures, Trump loyalists, and Republican congressmen for Mueller’s firing—a seemingly orchestrated campaign that has congressional Democrats and even some Republicans deeply worried? ","((ul))In the coming months, the two gathering crises may((/ul)) well ((ul))intersect((/ul)). Given his past behavior and personal volatility, a Trump order to fire Mueller might be a shocking offense against the justice process, but it would hardly be surprising, considering his previous efforts to obstruct justice in the Russia investigation. These include his asking FBI director James Comey for a pledge of personal loyalty and then firing him when he did not receive it, and his attempt (in March of last year) to stop Attorney General Jeff Sessions from recusing himself from the Russia investigation. Then there was the widely reported incident aboard Air Force One last July 8, when the President reportedly personally dictated a statement his son was to issue insisting that Donald Trump Jr.’s meeting with a Russian lawyer the year before was “primarily” to discuss “a program about the adoption of Russian children,” and not the ongoing presidential campaign. Like the repeated condemnations of the special counsel’s investigations, the demands that it come to a close, and the endless recitation of the mantra, “there was no collusion,” these three episodes reek of the fear of a man who has something to hide, and who is laboring obsessively to hide it.","((ul))((hl))We do not yet have proof((/hl))((/ul)) either ((ul))of ((/ul))((ul))((hl))what happened with Russia((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), or of how((/ul)) Donald ((ul))Trump will conduct himself((/ul)) as this second year of his presidency unfolds.

And would they truly be wrong?¶ Of course, this also undercuts Klein’s argument for a lower threshold for impeachment. If ((ul))Trump was removed from office that way, the political blowback would probably be the same.((/ul)) Regardless, in contrast to the 25th Amendment, impeaching and removing Trump from office remains a true hypothetical. In this polarized age, the only way Trump would be removed from office is if Democrats win 67 seats in the Senate. That is not going to happen anytime soon.¶((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))For Trump to lose properly, it has to be at the ballot box((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). Trump has to run for reelection and be repudiated by American voters. He has to lose the popular vote again, get trounced in the electoral college, and see his party pay the consequences((/ul)) of backing the most ignorant, illiberal president in modern American history.¶ Jacob T. Levy knows a lot about constitutional democracy, and over at the Niskanen Center’s blog he makes a powerful case of the need for a political over a legal solution to Trump’s failures as a leader:¶((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))Law aims at certainty, the definitive and correct protection of those who hold rights against those who would violate or undermine them. ((/ul))Politics offers no such certainties. Even at its best it is a domain of contestable judgments that never stop being contested. There is no final settlement; there is always another election. Liberals worry about majoritarianism, and think law can, as politics cannot, protect individuals and minorities from it. We imagine that constitutional settlements can tame politics, confining it within the boundaries of law, ensuring that it complies with justice and respects rights. But they can’t. …¶((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))The current administration shows why the defense of freedom and of the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))liberal society can’t be an exclusively legal concern. Rules can be manipulated((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) and danced around by the powerful. Legal proceedings are much slower than changes in political circumstances.((/ul)) And executive power is in its nature somewhat lawless. John Locke described executive prerogative as necessary in any system that separated the executive and legislative powers, and defined it as the “power to act according to discretion, for the public good, without the prescription of the law, and sometimes even against it.”…¶ If the independent executive cannot be successfully bound by law, then there is nothing else for it but politics. I’ve argued several times in this space that we need to understand the defense of the liberal society as a political project, one that is dependent on political resources from motivations for popular mobilization to organizational capacity to institutional counterbalances. (See also Michelle Schwarze’s fine essay.) The liberal order of free and open commerce, of religious liberty and freedom of speech and the press, and of rule-of-law constraints on state arbitrariness and violence requires strong political foundations; ((ul))while law is a crucial part of that order, it can’t pull itself up by its own bootstraps. The ((/ul))((ul))((hl))liberal society needs ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))an electorate((/hl))((/ul)), and elected officials, who are willing and able to stand up for it.¶((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))The absolute best way((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) for Trump and Trumpism to be repudiated ((/ul))((ul))((hl))is through ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))democratic((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) and ((/ul))((ul))((hl))not merely((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) legal means((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) If Doug Jones defeats Roy Moore in Alabama despite a presidential endorsement, that represents a blow to Trump in the same way he was humiliated by the Virginia state elections last month.

Representative Green had been talking about impeachment practically since Trump was sworn in (which was only a few months ago, impossible as that seems). Similar symbolic articles were filed against Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush — and against Bill Clinton, too, separate from the House’s later impeachment of him. The Sherman-Green impeachment effort is symbolic only because Democrats’ woeful congressional position ensures that the project is stillborn. If Democrats had the numbers, they would impeach Trump — and if they get the numbers, they will. ¶ But that isn’t Plan A. ((ul))((hl))Plan A is anarchy((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).((/hl)) ¶ As Trump prepared to take the oath of office, a group of sundry leftists of the anarchist variety declared their intention to “Become Ungovernable,” and they have made some progress on that front, from the violent protests surrounding the inauguration itself to the riots at Berkeley and on other college campuses. The Democratic establishment and its media allies — the Respectable Left — play a good-cop/bad-cop game with the blackshirts and rioters. The black bloc exercises a heckler’s veto, and the campus administrators and municipal authorities pretend to be saddened that they are obliged to bar conservative speakers from their campuses or restrict public discourse. The nice progressives in cardigans assure us that they deplore the violence of Antifa and similar goon squads, but they know who their friends are — and, more important, who they aren’t. Charles Murray can’t speak on a college campus without being physically assaulted, but the real danger, these progressives tell us, is that the NRA made a recruiting video. ¶ Feed the churn, feel the burn. If there’s a crisis, they’ll amplify it, even if they have to lie — e.g., CNN’s complete fabrication about a Google engineer “who argued women aren’t biologically fit for tech jobs.”¶ If there isn’t a crisis or a scandal, they’ll manufacture one: Colin Kaepernick can’t get a job in Donald Trump’s America! Angels and ministers of grace defend us. Progressive talk radio is a sty of conspiracy theories, hysteria, and bigotry that makes right-wing talk radio sound like Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus — which is not easy to do, because right-wing talk radio is bonkers. Cable-news commentary from the left is nearly as bad.¶ Institutional Democrats use the state and local governments they control as political weapons, and they have made great strides in politicizing business life. When the nation’s dairy producers declined to make a statement on the events in Charlottesville, Jesse Singal of New York magazine wrote: “You are either with us or against us, milk!” He was joking, but the joke is funny because it is so close to the facts. Progressives have boycotted L.L. Bean because one of its board members made a donation to a political-action committee that supported Trump. That wasn’t the company using the company’s money to support a candidate, just a board member who has a life outside of being on the board of L.L. Bean. ¶ And, of course, local “community organizers” take a sudden interest in monuments that have been sitting in local parks for a century. ¶ ((ul))((hl))Trump was((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), and is, unfit for the office he holds. He is also the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))duly elected president((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) of the United States of America((/ul)). Trump, being Trump, adds his own chaos to the mix: his petulant schoolboy tweeting, his Queeg-and-the-strawberries press conferences, his penchant for surrounding himself with nutcases like Steve Bannon and his gormless children and in-laws. If what you want is chaos, then Donald J. Trump — a retired game-show host who apparently believes there were “a lot of good people” at a neo-Nazi rally that ended with a political murder — is your man. You could hardly do better. ¶ The Left has a short game and a long one here((ul)). The short game is paralyzing Trump if not driving him from office. The long game is using Trump to discredit the Republican party and the conservative movement, both of which have, to their discredit, embraced and defended Trump with various degrees of enthusiasm((/ul)). Some of the smarter right-wing talking mouths on cable news have already developed aggressive amnesia regarding their own complicity in Trump’s rise, and it is likely that many will follow. The line of argument will be: “Hey, I was a big Ted Cruz supporter, really, but, after the primary, it was Trump or Hillary.” Some people will need reminding of what they said and did. ¶ Trump was, and is, unfit for the office he holds. He is also the duly elected president of the United States of America. Nothing since January has changed that. ¶ The Democrats think they are beating the Republicans at their own game. Republicans countenanced cranks who insisted that Barack Obama was a Kenyan and a Muslim, and Democrats raised the stakes with claims that Donald Trump is a Russian plant and a Nazi. A few years ago, John Kerry mournfully scolded Republicans who had, so he claimed, questioned his patriotism. We were all supposed to recoil from the idea of questioning anybody’s patriotism. That was quaint. Now, Democrats insist that their political opponents are traitors, that ordinary politics is treason, and that their rivals ought not only be defeated at the ballot box but jailed. If Robert Mueller has discovered something to justify that kind of talk, he is being awfully quiet about it. The problem for Democrats is that the past 20 years have shown beyond any doubt that the Republicans are the better opposition party. The problem for Republicans is that an effective opposition party eventually ceases to be the opposition and has to govern, a task for which Republicans appear to be unprepared. ¶ ((ul))We cannot allow the current state of affairs, in which the loss of a presidential election is met with ever wilder and more vicious attempts to immobilize the executive, to become the new normal.

There are plausible scenarios under which it would be unambiguously imperative to get Trump out of office: if he were planning to launch a nuclear strike or an invasion against another country, for example. But under current circumstances, ((ul))it’s far from obvious that impeachment would be the unalloyed good that some Democrats seem to be imagining((/ul)). If anything, I think ((ul))((hl))there’s a((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))significant possibility((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))we would be ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))worse off((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) after ((/ul))((ul))((hl))impeaching Trump((/hl))((/ul)). We should proceed with extreme caution, and not lose our heads in the event that there ends up being a sudden groundswell of support for the measure among Republican lawmakers. Rather than simply fantasizing about a World Without Trump, ((ul))we have to soberly weigh the cons of a Trump presidency against the cons of a Trump removal.((/ul)) There are no good options here: there are only bad options, and worse options.¶ ((ul))The((/ul)) first and ((ul))most important consequence of a Trump removal is a Pence presidency.((/ul)) Some commentators are sanguine about this outcome, regarding Pence as a run-of-the-mill Republican politician who will likely be a steady hand at the wheel. In a Chicago Tribune article entitled “The liberal case for President Mike Pence,” Francis Wilkinson writes that “the Indiana Republican is as dull and serviceable a politician as Trump is bizarre and broken,” adding that “I’m consistently perplexed when others don’t share my enthusiasm for the humdrum Hoosier.” Democrats who are eager for Trump’s impeachment, presumably, must feel similarly.¶ But ((ul))we’d be stupid to underestimate the amount of damage a “humdrum” conservative can do. All the qualities that make ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Pence((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), in one sense, less dangerous than Trump—the fact ((/ul))((ul))((hl))that he ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))is cool, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))collected, and((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) apparently ((/ul))((ul))((hl))on((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) more or less ((/ul))((ul))((hl))good terms with his((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) Republican ((/ul))((ul))((hl))colleagues—make him((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), in other senses, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))much more dangerous((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) than Trump((/ul)). A recent New Yorker profile of Pence, which describes him as “the corporate right’s inside man,” portrays Pence as a savvy and ambitious politician. ((ul))He was the Koch Brothers’ anointed candidate before Trump’s ascendancy to the nomination, and a prime specimen of the sort of heartless conservative fundamentalism((/ul)) that was, prior to the Trump era, viewed as the greatest enemy to left values. What we currently know of his personal views and his policy positions is disturbing. Pence has made no particular secret of despising the LGBT community: ((ul))Trump recently made a joke to the effect that Pence wants to “hang” all gay people, which had a chilling frisson of truth to it. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))He((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) apparently ((/ul))((ul))((hl))does not believe in climate change((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), and, during his decade in Congress, had a consistent track record of voting against environmental protection, anti-pollution measures, and clean energy. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))He has been centrally involved in((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))efforts to repeal the ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))Affordable Care Act((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). As governor of Indiana, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Pence moved to ban((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) the resettlement of ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Syrian refugees((/hl))((/ul))((ul)),((/ul)) long before Trump had proposed his Muslim Ban.¶ Given these facts, do we think((ul)) Pence is likely to continue the same policies((/ul)) that have made Trump’s presidency reprehensible? It seems almost certain. Will Pence, ((ul))by virtue of his more amicable relationship with his own party, his((/ul)) ((ul))ability to manage his executive appointees, and the goodwill he will buy from Democrats in Congress by presenting a civil and decorous contrast to Trump, be more likely to actually implement these dangerous policies successfully((/ul))? This also seems highly plausible. Trump has already advanced a lot of terrible policies, even from the midst of a beleaguered and fractious administration. ((ul))How much more damage could a competent Pence be capable of accomplishing((/ul)), in comparison to an overwhelmed Trump? It’s a troubling thought.¶ My other concern about the potential fallout of a Trump impeachment is more abstract and nebulous, but still, I think, something serious and worth considering. It’s hard to say, but ((ul))we may be at something of a national crossroads when it comes to public trust in democratic processes((/ul)). Trump’s election to the presidency wasn’t inexplicable, inasmuch as it’s not especially difficult to enumerate a list of factors that likely contributed to the success of his campaign, but it was still weird in a way that’s hard to define concretely. One feels it may be a symptom of something strange moving through our political environment that we don’t quite know how to categorize yet, and which we likely won’t be able to see clearly for at least a few more years. It certainly seems to betoken a level of distrust and disgust in government that has been growing for the past few years, and has now reached a critical pitch. Partisan polarization has arrived at a point where political opponents actively accuse each other of promulgating “fake news” and staging false-flag type operations. The conspiratorial view of politics—which is almost always exaggerated, but nevertheless never quite incorrect—has become increasingly mainstream.¶ Given this context, ((ul))((hl))if Trump((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), the democratically-elected head of state, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))is impeached((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) and removed from office, Trump ((/ul))((ul))((hl))supporters are((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) very ((/ul))((ul))((hl))unlikely to believe((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) that this ((/ul))((ul))((hl))removal was legitimately executed((/hl))((/ul))((ul)): they will believe that Trump was deposed via a conspiracy of political elites. ((/ul))(And ((ul))to some extent, they will be right—if Trump is impeached, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the specific legal grounds((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) that are adduced likely ((/ul))((ul))((hl))won’t reflect((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) the genuine ((/ul))((ul))((hl))ideological((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) or self-interested ((/ul))((ul))((hl))motives((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) of the Democratic and Republican lawmakers who support the impeachme((/ul))nt). The removal from power of a head of state who has no intention of going quietly is always a fraught matter, and it’s something the U.S. hasn’t had to think about very seriously, since ((ul))((hl))we have a ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))lengthy((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) recent ((/ul))((ul))((hl))history((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) of stable transfers of power((/hl))((/ul)), and a certain faith in the robustness of our civic institutions.

I don’t want to be alarmist, but it seems worth pointing out that if Trump is removed from office, two-thirds of the country is going to be something between “indifferent” and “ostentatiously jubilant,” and a pretty heavily-armed third of the country is going to be outraged. All of this is to say, President Pence is by far the most serious immediate consequence of a Trump removal, but I think the effect a Trump removal would have on our larger political landscape, in both the short and long term, is very difficult to declare with any certainty, and should not be taken lightly."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":101}},{"tag":"Pence causes U.S.-Russia war","cite":"Bobo Lo 17, Nonresident Fellow at the Lowy Institute, Associate Research Fellow with the Russia/NIS Center at the French Institute of International Relations, previously Head of the Russia and Eurasia Programme at Chatham House and Deputy Head of Mission at the Australian Embassy in Moscow, 10/25/17, “AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN: TRUMP, PUTIN AND THE US–RUSSIA RELATIONSHIP,” https://www.lowyinstitute.org/publications/accident-waiting-happen-trump-putin-and-us-russia-relationship","text":["((ul))For the time being((/ul))((ul)), ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the Kremlin will keep faith with Trump((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) as ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the least bad option((/hl))((/ul)), consistent with the Russian adage, ‘hope dies last’ (nadezhda umiraet poslednei).

State politics are different from national politics. Even if Northam isn’t raking in cash hand over fist, he has still outraised Gillespie and pulled in nearly three times as many donations of less than $100 as the Republican. More than that, ((ul))((hl))gubernatorial elections((/hl))((/ul)) — especially in Virginia — ((ul))((hl))don’t((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) necessarily ((/ul))((ul))((hl))reflect the national mood((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul))((ul))¶ ((/ul))The best way to see that this race is not necessarily a reliable barometer for the rest of the country is to ((ul))compare the result in past Virginia gubernatorial elections with the national House vote in the following midterm. Rather than use the raw Virginia result, ((/ul))though,((ul)) we ((/ul))want to((ul)) adjust for the state’s “partisan lean,”((/ul)) a measure of how the state would vote in a neutral political environment in that year.1¶ Let’s use the 1993 Virginia governor’s race as an example. Back then, Virginia had a Republican lean of +10.6 percentage points — meaning that if there had been a presidential race in 1993 and that race had ended up tied 50-50 nationally, we’d expect the Republican to win in Virginia by 10.6 points. Republican George Allen won the Virginia governor’s race by 17.4 points that year, and if we had used that race to gauge the national environment, we would have concluded that the country favored Republicans by nearly 7 points. The next year, Republicans won the national House vote by 7 points. Unfortunately, most Virginia governor elections haven’t been so predictive.¶ ((ul))((hl))The average difference between Democrats’((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) over- or under((/ul))((ul))((hl))performance((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))in Virginia and the((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) following national ((/ul))((ul))((hl))House vote has been((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) 7 percentage points. That’s ((/ul))((ul))((hl))a ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))pretty big miss((/hl))((/ul)) — and just a few points could make or break the Democrats’ shot at a House majority.¶ In 2009, for example, Republican Bob McDonnell’s landslide victory over Democrat Creigh Deeds accurately presaged Republicans taking over the House in 2010, though the national House margin ended up being much smaller. Four years later, however, Democrat Terry McAuliffe’s win over Republican Ken Cuccinelli gave Democrats false hope ahead of the 2014 midterms, in which they lost control of the Senate. The 2001 Virginia governor election was similarly misleading: Democrat Mark Warner outperformed the presidential lean of the state by 14 points, and the following year Republicans easily held onto control in the House.¶ So why isn’t the Virginia election a good national barometer?¶ First, ((ul))one election is never a reliable barometer of much of anything((/ul)) — the same way watching one NBA game doesn’t tell you much about how the whole season will play out. That’s why, for special elections, I’ve been arguing that we need to look at the results as a group to get a sense where the national political environment is.¶ Second, ((ul))((hl))while most politics have become((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))nationalized((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) (people vote for one party up and down the ballot), ((/ul))((ul))((hl))governor’s races are still an exception((/hl))((/ul))((hl)). ((/hl))((ul))((hl))How else do you explain Republican governors in((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) the very blue states of ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Maryland, Massachusetts and Vermont?

In theory, you’d expect the presidential lean of a state to have its greatest impact when presidential candidates are literally on the ballot. Yet there was a 17 percentage point difference((/ul)), on average, between gubernatorial and presidential results in these 12 states.¶ So even if Northam or Gillespie wins by 10 points, we really won’t be able to say that much about what it means for 2018."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":62}},{"tag":"Trump crushes the warming---causes ((ul))rollback((/ul)), kills ((ul))international cooperation((/ul)), and ((ul))ends enforcement((/ul))","cite":"David Roberts 16, energy and environment writer for Vox, “Most people are wildly underestimating what Trump’s win will mean for the environment,” 11/14/16, http://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2016/11/14/13582562/trump-gop-climate-environmental-policy","text":["((ul))Unified ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Republican control((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) of the federal government over the next two years ((/ul))((ul))((hl))augurs a ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))sea change in((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) US ((/ul))((ul))((hl))environmental policy((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) like nothing since the late 1960s and ’70s((/ul)), when America’s landmark environmental laws were first passed.","If Donald Trump and the GOP actually follow through on what they’ve promised, this time around will be a lurch in the opposite direction.

That's why it's important to put these fears into context and try to determine just how much weight they ought to be accorded.¶ Methane on Ice¶ Let's start with some basics on methane—CH4—a greenhouse gas that reaches the atmosphere from sources as diverse as wetlands, gas drilling, and cow burps. Compared with carbon dioxide, methane is kind of like the boxer who punches himself out in the early rounds, whereas carbon dioxide goes the distance and wins by TKO. Pound for pound, methane causes some 25 times as much global warming as carbon dioxide does. But it only remains in the atmosphere for about nine years, on average, before chemical processes break it down. Carbon dioxide, in contrast, has a far longer atmospheric residence time.¶ What this means is that methane is most worrisome if a lot of it gets into the atmosphere over a relatively short time period—precisely the scenario contemplated by the Nature paper. So could that happen?¶ The answer depends on a complicated and uncertainty-laden issue—the stability of frozen deposits of subsea methane in the Arctic region. Frankly, it's hard to imagine something harder to study: We're talking about deposits residing not only beneath one of the world's most remote and inaccessible oceans, but also beneath the sea floor itself.¶ Much of the world's methane is concentrated in the form of so-called gas \"hydrates,\" icelike solids that form from methane and water at cold temperatures and high pressures, e.g., deep beneath the ocean floor. According to the US Geological Survey, the total global carbon content of such methane hydrates is estimated to equal some 1,800 gigatons (to be sure, there is considerable uncertainty about this estimate).¶ One thousand eight hundred gigatons would create a climate catastrophe if it were all to be suddenly released, but ((ul))the vast majority of((/ul))((ul)) subsea ((/ul))((ul))((hl))methane is under deep water((/hl))((/ul)), ((ul))((hl))and((/hl))((/ul)) ((ul))((hl))quite stable((/hl))((/ul)). Only a relatively small fraction of global methane hydrates are at issue in the Nature paper, and this methane is in a very peculiar situation: It is frozen in the subsea permafrost of relatively shallow continental shelves in the Arctic region. This frozen sediment was once coastline, but was submerged as oceans rose following the last Ice Age. And now, it is being bathed in warmer waters due to the warming of the Arctic.¶ So how much should we worry that these particular methane hydrates might melt, releasing gas that would then travel through both sediment and seawater to reach the atmosphere? That's where the scientific debate begins—over both how much methane falls into this category, and how vulnerable it is to the warming that is now gripping the Arctic region.¶ Peering Beneath the East Siberian Sea¶ ((ul))The methane disaster concerns gained major prominence with a 2010 paper in Science((/ul)) by University of Alaska-Fairbanks researcher Natalia Shakhova and her colleagues, who examined methane emissions in a very remote area of the Arctic, the East Siberian Sea north of Russia. The continental shelf underlying this ocean is more than 2 million square kilometers in size, and its subsea permafrost lies only about 50 meters below the sea surface. Traveling to the remote region in Russian ice-breakers, Shakhova's team sampled water content and air content at the sea surface repeatedly, over a series of years. They found high concentrations of methane in the water—\"50% of surface waters are supersaturated with methane,\" the paper reported—and some of the gas was also venting from the water into the atmosphere.¶ Although the Science paper did not contain the figure, it seems clear that ((ul))Shakhova is the source for the idea that a 50-gigaton release of methane could occur in a short time frame((/ul)). Or as she put it in a 2008 abstract, \"[W]e consider release of up to 50 Gt of predicted amount of hydrate storage as highly possible for abrupt release at any time,\" adding that this could lead to \"catastrophic greenhouse warming.\" The Nature paper cited another 2010 paper by Shakhova and her colleagues in the journal Doklady Earth Sciences, which uses the 50 gigaton figure in discussing possible methane emission scenarios.¶ Shakhova did not respond to several requests for comment for this article; her automatic email response said she out doing fieldwork. But Peter Wadhams, the Cambridge physicist who is a coauthor of the Nature paper, said that his work relied on that of Shakhova and her team because \"they’ve done the most work there, working there every year, doing field observations…we would rather base it on the estimates of the people actually working there, rather than the people who aren’t working there.\" Here is a video of Shakhova discussing her research:¶ The trouble is that at this point, ((ul))many other scientists ((/ul))((ul))don't accept that work((/ul))—((ul))or((/ul)) rather, ((ul))don't agree about its implications((/ul)). None seem to dispute the actual measurements taken by Shakhova and her team, but as soon as the Science paper came out, ((ul))a group of researchers questioned the idea that there was any cause for alarm((/ul)). \"((ul))A newly discovered [methane] source is not necessarily a changing source((/ul)), much less a source that is changing in response to Arctic warming,\" they wrote. The implication is that ((ul))perhaps methane has always been in the water at such levels, without methane hydrates having been disturbed((/ul))—rather, the methane may be from another source. According to one 2011 study, for instance, the observed methane probably came not from hydrates, but simply from \"the permafrost's still adjusting to its new aquatic conditions, even after 8,000 years.\" ((ul))The hydrates((/ul)), in contrast, ((ul))are((/ul))((ul)) thought to be ((/ul))((ul))much ((/ul))((ul))deeper below the sea surface((/ul))((ul)), due to basic physical constraints on their formation and stability((/ul)). According to the US Geological Survey, \"in permafrost areas, ((ul))methane hydrate is not stable until about 225 m depth((/ul)).\"¶ Indeed, according to Ed Dlugokencky, who monitors global atmospheric methane levels at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), \"so far, ((ul))((hl))there((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))has not been a significant increase in methane emissions in the Arctic((/hl))((/ul)).\" In other words, if methane is really starting to vent into the air in large quantities, Dlugokencky says he isn't seeing it.¶ A Debate Over Hydrate Depth¶ And that's just the first reason that ((ul))many scientists are skeptical((/ul)). According to Carolyn Ruppel, who heads the Gas Hydrates Project at the US Geological Survey, ((ul))there just isn't that much vulnerable methane in submerged permafrost to begin with((/ul)). \"We think very little hydrate on this planet is associated with permafrost, either subsea or terrestrial,\" she says. Inspired in part by the Shakhova research, the USGS undertook to study the continental shelves of the Beaufort Sea, off Alaska and Canada. \"We set out to test this idea that all of the Arctic shelves were going to have high methane emissions,\" she says. \"And at least for the US Beaufort shelf, we're not seeing them.\"¶ Ruppel acknowledges that due to Arctic warming, ((ul))more methane is going to be released((/ul)), much of it from permafrost on land. But, she continues, \"I would say ((ul))one of the least likely sources is methane gas hydrates. You are limited by the laws of physics((/ul)),\" she adds—noting that the beginning of ((ul))((hl))the zone of stability((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) for these hydrates ((/ul))((ul))((hl))is((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) some ((/ul))((ul))((hl))220 meters deep((/hl))((/ul)). That's a recurrent refrain among skeptics—they say hydrates just can't form above a certain depth, and ((ul))((hl))warming can't penetrate such a depth((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) very ((/ul))((ul))((hl))quickly((/hl))((/ul)). \"((ul))You've got to go from the sea floor of 50 meters depth, down to 200 meters where the hydrate is((/ul)),\" explains the University of Chicago's David Archer. \"So that just takes a long time.\"¶ Moreover, ((ul))even if subsea((/ul))((ul)) permafrost methane hydrates do thaw, the liberated gas still has to travel through layers of sediment just to get to the ocean floor((/ul)). So how does that happen? \"That's kind of mysterious,\" says Archer. Perhaps there will be open pathways for gas in some places, but perhaps there won't. Archer also notes that there have been ((ul))((hl))undersea explosions((/hl))((/ul)) or landslides that release methane in bursts, but \"those kinds of things seem like they ((ul))((hl))would be((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) relatively ((/ul))((ul))((hl))small((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) compared to 50 gigatons, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))and((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))they((/ul))((ul)) would ((/ul))((ul))((hl))happen((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) sporadically in time ((/ul))((ul))((hl))over centuries((/hl))((/ul)), not everything blows up in a few years.\"¶ Nonetheless, imagine that methane gas from melted hydrate makes it to the sea floor. It now exists as bubbles with, say, 50 meters to go before they reach the sea surface. ((ul))((hl))Most((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) of the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))bubbles won't make it((/hl))((/ul)), say scientists: ((ul))((hl))They'll be dissolved in seawater((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), and then the ((/ul))((ul))methane will be broken down by microorganisms((/ul))((ul)) over a period of months((/ul)). \"If methane is in the ocean water column, most of it doesn't get out,\" explains Bill Reeburgh, a professor of earth system science at the University of California-Irvine who has spent his career studying methane. \"((ul))Most of it is oxidized\" by bacteria((/ul)), which turn it into carbon dioxide and water, Reeburgh continues. \"So all these stories about seeps, people seem to think the bubbles go straight to the atmosphere, and they don't.\"¶ In other words, while the waters of ((ul))the East Siberian Sea may be full of dissolved methane((/ul)), for many scientists ((ul))that doesn't prove that hydrates have been disturbed, or that the Arctic is starting to vent large amounts of methane((/ul)) from below the sea floor into the atmosphere.

The following describes how it still has a way to go.","Applying organized scepticism to research on the effects of OA","Scientific or academic scepticism calls for critical scrutiny of research outputs before they are accepted as new knowledge (Merton, 1973). Duarte et al. (2014) stated that “…there is a perception that scientific skepticism has been abandoned or relaxed in many areas…” of marine science. They argue that OA is one such area, and conclude that ((ul))((hl))there is((/hl))((/ul)), ((ul))((hl))at best((/hl))((/ul)), ((ul))((hl))weak evidence to support((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) an ((/ul))((ul))((hl))OA-driven decline((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) of calcifiers.((/ul)) Below, I raise some of the aspects of OA research to which I contend an insufficient level of organized scepticism has been applied (in some cases, also to the articles in this theme issue). ((ul))((hl))I arrived at that((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) conclusion ((/ul))((ul))((hl))after reading((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))hundreds of articles((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) on((/ul))((ul)) OA((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))(including, to be fair, some that also raise these issues) and overseeing the peer-review process for the very large number of submissions to this themed issue. Importantly, and as Duarte et al. (2014) make clear, a retrospective application of scientific scepticism such as the one that follows could—and should—be applied to any piece of/body of research.","Exposure levels, water chemistry, and limits to making inferences about the effect of a long-term driver from a short-term experiment","Many ((ul))((hl))early studies on OA((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) applied treatment levels that ((/ul))((ul))greatly exceeded((/ul))((ul)) even worst-case climate change scenarios and ((/ul))((ul))((hl))did not report water chemistry((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) in sufficient detail ((/ul))((ul))((hl))to determine if((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))treatment mimicked future((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) OA-driven seawater ((/ul))((ul))((hl))conditions((/hl))((/ul)). Although most recent work has improved with respect to treatment levels, mimicking future water chemistry remains tricky.","A rationale commonly used to justify high CO2/low pH treatments is the need to identify at what levels organisms are affected. However, the limits to making inferences about how an organism or ecosystem will respond to a climate-change scale variable (i.e. one that changes over decades–centuries) from their response during a short-term challenge experiment (i.e. hours–days–weeks) has not been adequately addressed—or even mentioned—in most studies. This is reflected in a confusion of terms common in OA studies—when describing the outcome of a short-term CO2 challenge, authors often make the inferential leap and use “OA” when discussing their results, without any caveats. Oddly, incorporation of the extensive toxicology literature is almost entirely missing from OA studies, either when it comes to adopting established exposure protocols or to framing the inferences that can/cannot be drawn from short-term experiments. Also ((ul))missing from most studies is anything more than a superficial statement about the possibility for ((/ul))((ul))acclimation((/ul))((ul)), ((/ul))((ul))adaptation((/ul))((ul)), or ((/ul))((ul))evolution((/ul)), something that is ((ul))necessary to extend the outcome of a short-term challenge experiment((/ul)) ((ul))into((/ul)) an inference about the effect of ((ul))a long-term driver((/ul)) (see below).","Spatio-temporal variability in CO2 and pH","Biogeochemists are well aware of the spatio-temporal variability in CO2 and pH—daily (high productivity areas), seasonal (blooms), interannual (higher temperatures), horizontal (coastal upwelling areas, high turbidity zones), and vertical (deep vs. surface waters) ranges in these can be extensive (e.g. Wootton et al., 2008; Hofmann et al., 2011; Waldbusser and Salisbury, 2014; Kapsenberg et al., 2015). Biologists have struggled to incorporate this variability into experiments designed to test the effects of OA, and into their interpretations of the outcomes (Eriander et al., 2016). Some researchers have pointed out that organisms that are exposed to large ranges in CO2 and pH during their daily lives (e.g. vertical migrators), life cycles (e.g. organisms that reside offshore as larvae but move to the coast as juveniles or adults), or somewhere in their distributional ranges, should be more tolerant of OA (e.g. Lewis et al., 2013).","Imbalanced focus on individuals that are affected and insufficient focus on inter-individual variability and within-experiment selection bias interpretations of ecological impacts","Almost all ((ul))CO2((/ul))((ul)) challenge experiments produce a ((/ul))((ul))range of responses((/ul))((ul)) in the test organism((/ul))—some individuals are badly affected, others less, and some not at all. There are several issues associated with all such experiments that it is important to be cognizant of and account for: (i) analyses and interpretations should not ignore or minimize individuals that are little affected or unaffected (after all, these are the ones whose genes will be passed on to the next generation); (ii) inter-individual variability should be highlighted; (iii) the longer that the experiment runs the more likely it is that an internal selection process for the tolerant individuals has occurred. All of these are important in the context of the next section.","Acclimation, generational carry-over effects, adaptation, epigenetics, and evolution","((ul))Almost all ((/ul))((ul))((hl))experiments((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) conducted ((/ul))((ul))((hl))to assess OA are ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))short-term toxicity challenges((/hl))((/ul)).

Recent studies indicate that even the effects of OA that are considered most worrisome—various behavioural impairments resulting from short-term exposure to high CO2 (see Nagelkerken and Munday, 2016)—might be reduced or overcome through adaptation and evolution (Regan et al., 2016). More knowledge of the mechanisms of direct action of OA-related drivers—higher concentrations of CO2, hydrogen ions (=lower pH), and/or carbonate chemistry (less carbonate ions)—and of indirect drivers such as the effects of OA on food quality, are essential to understand what degree of adaption is possible.

Further, it is also important to recognize that studies showing no effect of OA are less equivocal than those that do, for all of the reasons noted above.
