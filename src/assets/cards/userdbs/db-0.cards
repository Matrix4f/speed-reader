This was a term first used by Alvin Hansen in the 1930s to describe slow growth due in part to aging societies, among other issues. Some of Japan’s economic stagnation is thought to be related to its demographics since its population is the oldest and fastest-aging in the world.","((ul))((hl))Economic growth occurs when workers and capital are added to the economy, along with technology((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), a well-known result from growth models first developed by the Nobel Prize-winning economist((/ul)) Robert ((ul))Solow((/ul)). ((ul))But an aging population means fewer workers. Fewer workers require fewer office buildings and machinery, which depresses investment and therefore the economic outlook.((/ul)) ","Another wrinkle is that ((ul))((hl))the U.S. has been suffering from stagnant median wage growth for decades((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).((/hl)) ((ul))Low pay means that some companies hire workers instead of installing more units of capital, which further depresses investment.

In other words, the expectation in bond markets is that the new neutral interest rate, or where the current rate rises will end up, will be lower than the previous average rate of 5%.","The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the think tank for rich countries, has looked at this issue and finds that weak output growth is a drag on productivity. That brings us full circle in that output per worker or machine can’t increase strongly if overall economic growth remains subdued.","So how much is invested, including in raising the skills of existing workers, matters a great deal to boost growth. It also means that ((ul))the new path of ((/ul))((ul))((hl))economic growth((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), whether it is fast or slow, is ((/ul))((ul))((hl))within the control of the government((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) and firms as well as workers who can invest in their own human capital to be better equipped to use technology. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))It is not just the inevitable outcome of an aging society.((/hl))((/ul))","But one challenge is that ((ul))recent technological improvements, centered on information and communication technologies and the internet, do not seem to have raised productivity across the economy as expected. Solow’s 1987 observation that “you can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics” is known as the Solow paradox.((/ul)) He revisited this question decades later, but concluded that we still do not know whether computers have boosted productivity as the role of computing is still evolving.","Where there have been periods of faster productivity growth, such as in the late 1990s, it seemed to be due to technology being better embedded into business practices. Embedded technology improves the productivity of workers, which increases capital accumulation by slowing down the diminishing returns to capital. Diminishing returns happen when a worker is given more than, say, one computer; that worker won’t produce as much with the second computer as compared with the first one unless he has the programming skills to run an algorithm that allows computing to be done without the worker using it all the time. ","If the digital age is to increase productivity and lead to a stronger phase of economic growth, it will require investment in not just R&D, but also peoples’ skills and firms’ practices to embed those technologies into how businesses operate. An example is law firms that are starting to use AI to conduct some aspects of due diligence, which frees up the time of junior associates to undertake other legal work.","((ul))Although the Solow paradox is still with us, there are signs that technology is becoming better embedded, such as artificial intelligence that ((/ul))((ul))can do((/ul))((ul)) computing without a constant human presence.((/ul)) But to ensure that happens requires investment in more nuanced ways — notably in how to embed tech into the workplace. This will vary from firm to firm, but investing in this area, as well as in the well-understood areas of R&D/innovation, will likely generate returns.","It could even lead to a virtuous circle of growth. Seeing higher output per worker could induce more investment by firms as the returns to capital are higher. And more investment in turn raises economic growth rates, and that could help us avoid a slow growth future.","So, reassuringly, ((ul))demography is not destiny. It is within our control to invest in ways that better embed technologies, which in turn would help us to avoid a slow growth future.

((ul))America((/ul)) in 2017 ((ul))is undergoing an unprecedented period of demographic transition((/ul)). The birth rate among native-born women has fallen below the replacement level. Starting around the year 2010, the huge cohort of baby boomers began to retire from the workforce. ((ul))The growth of the civilian labor force has been falling steadily((/ul)), from 1.2 percent per year in the 1990s to 0.7 percent per year in the 2000–2010 period to 0.5 percent per year in the current decade.4 The number of working-age Americans (age 25–64) born in the United States to US-born parents has already begun to decline and will shrink by more than 8 million from 2015 to 2035.5 Whatever growth the United States experiences in the workforce in the next two decades will be because of immigrants and the children of immigrants.","((ul))Immigrants((/ul)) admitted to the United States each year ((ul))tend to be younger than native-born Americans and are more inclined to participate in the labor force((/ul)). According to data from the US Department of Homeland Security, the median age of permanent immigrants admitted to the United States in the past decade is 32.5,6 while the median age of all US residents (including immigrants) is 37.6.7 So the median age of those receiving lawful permanent resident (LPR) status is five years younger than the median age of all US residents. ","Immigrants are not only younger than their native-born counterparts but also more inclined to participate in the labor force. The latter is especially true of immigrant men. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the labor force participation rate of all foreign-born individuals was 65.2 percent in 2016, compared with the participation rate for the native born of 62.3 percent. For foreign-born men, the participation rate was 77.8 percent, a full 10 percentage points higher than the rate for native-born men, 67.5 percent. The participation rate of foreign-born women was slightly lower than the rate of native-born women, 53.4 percent compared to 57.5 percent. The unemployment rate for foreign-born persons in the United States in 2016 was 4.3 percent, compared with an unemployment rate for native-born workers of 5.0 percent.8 ","((ul))Without a growing workforce, US companies will find it increasingly dif((/ul))((ul))ficult to hire the workers they need to meet domestic and global demand. Man((/ul))((ul))ufacturing, agriculture, construction, and high technology are among the sec((/ul))((ul))tors that are expected to suffer the most acute shortages of workers.((/ul)) ((ul))((hl))A declining workforce would slow US growth ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))potential ((/ul))((ul))((hl))and reduce the relative size of the US economy and ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))US ((/ul))((ul))((hl))influence in the world.((/hl))((/ul)) ","((ul))The continuing slowdown in the growth of the US workforce will also impose a growing strain on federal retirement programs.((/ul)) One measure of the country’s ability to fund retirement programs is the Old Age Dependency Ratio (OADR)—the number of Americans who are 65 and older versus the number of Americans who are in their working years of 25 to 64. The OADR fluctuated within the range of 19 to 24 up until 2010, but with baby boomers now retiring in large numbers, the ratio is expected to climb above 40 by 2030 and reach 47.5 by 2065. If legal immigration were sharply curtailed, as has been proposed, the future OADR would rise even higher. If immigration were cut off immediately, the ratio would reach 55.9 by 2065.9 ","The smaller the future Old Age Dependency Ratio, the less strain there will be on federal retirement programs. ((ul))A steady or increased inflow of immi((/ul))((ul))grant workers helps to spread the cost of funding old-age pension payments across a larger pool of workers, reducing the need to raise payroll taxes, cut benefits, or both.((/ul)) ","More Immigrants, More Output, More Jobs ","Immigration reform would allow the US economy to grow faster by increasing the number of workers in the labor force and the total number of hours worked per year. ((ul))Because immigrants are more likely to be of working age than native-born Americans and are more likely to seek work, immigration can help to slow or even reverse the recent trend of declining labor force participation.((/ul)) ","((ul))((hl))An increase in the workforce driven by immigration does not lead to a gen((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))eral displacement of existing native-born workers((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) ((ul))Although the US labor force has more than doubled in the past 50 years, there has been no upward trend in the unemployment rate because the economic activity enabled by the growth in workers has also stimulated demand for workers.((/ul))10 ((ul))As the workforce grows, so too does demand for all the goods and services that American households pur((/ul))((ul))chase, from groceries and cars to education and housing. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))This increased demand in turn stimulates more production, leading to more employment ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))and the main((/ul))((ul))tenance of full employment((/ul))((ul))((hl)).((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))","((ul))A growing workforce also stimulates investment by increasing the returns on capital. While immigration can put downward pressure on wages in certain indus((/ul))((ul))tries in the short run, the availability of more workers at competitive wages creates incentives for greater investment. And ((/ul))((ul))rising investment stimulates more demand for labor, increases productivity, and creates upward pressure on wages((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) ((ul))The increased investment spurred by immigration means that((/ul)), over time((ul)), the capital-to-labor ratio grows the same amount even if the number of immigrants increases.((/ul))11","Immigrants Complement US Workers, Increasing Gains from Specialization ","Immigrants do more than increase the size of the labor force. Because ((ul))immi((/ul))((ul))grants tend to have different skills than the typical native, they boost the growth of the US economy by filling niches in the labor market. Immigrants tend to be overrepresented at the higher and lower ends of the skill spectrum, while native-born Americans tend to be clustered in the middle skill levels. Immigrants make up 17 percent of the US workforce, but they account for more than one-third of workers in the United States with a PhD in((/ul)) the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math (((ul))STEM((/ul))). On the other end of the skills spectrum, immigrants represent 40 percent of those in the workforce without a high school diploma.12 ","((ul))The complementary nature of immigration means that immigrants do not compete directly with ((/ul))((ul))the vast majority of((/ul))((ul)) Americans for employment.((/ul)) In fact, ((ul))((hl))by providing skills that are in relatively short supply, immigrants enable US workers to be more productive((/hl))((/ul)). ((ul))In the technology area, immigrants make up a disproportionate share of scientists, college professors, and technical work((/ul))((ul))ers. Native-born Americans are not earning qualifying degrees in numbers suf((/ul))((ul))ficient to fill the available positions in US industry.((/ul)) By filling those positions, high-skilled immigrants add to the “agglomeration effect” by creating a critical mass of workers in a particular region and industry where ideas can be shared more easily.13 Silicon Valley is the most notable example. ","((ul))Because of differences in English proficiency, immigrants tend to concen((/ul))((ul))trate in more technical occupations such as the job of computer specialist. This creates more opportunities for native-born workers, who are more concentrated among managers, sales personnel, and other occupations requiring more interac((/ul))((ul))tion with customers and subordinates.((/ul))14 ","On the lower rungs of the skills ladder, immigrants fill jobs that fewer and fewer Americans are interested in, and they fill those positions at wage rates that allow their industries to remain competitive in the US market. Such jobs require only short-term, on-the-job training and include health service workers, personal service workers, farm laborers, cleaning service and food service workers, construction workers, textile machine operators, carpenters, and nonfarm laborers.15 Low-skilled immigrants also fill positions in the growing health and home care service sectors, such as home health aides, nursing aides, orderlies, attendants, personal and home care aides, medical assistants, and maids and housekeepers.16 ","Such jobs were filled in decades past by adult Americans without a high school diploma, but the number of native-born Americans in that category has been steadily shrinking. From 2000 to 2016, the number of native-born Americans 25 and older who had not completed high school fell by almost 7 million, from 20.5 million to 13.5 million. As a share of the adult native-born population, the share of high school dropouts has declined in that same period from 13.4 percent to 7.6 percent, and the share continues to decline.17 ","Contrary to popular belief, a large majority of native-born workers do not compete for jobs with low-skilled immigrants. Studies show that immigration may have a modest negative effect on wages earned by the small and shrinking pool of adult Americans without a high school diploma,18 but the impact on the wages of the other 92 percent of native-born Americans in the labor force is neutral to positive. ((ul))On the high-skilled end of the spectrum, the impact of immi((/ul))((ul))gration on the wages of the native born is muted by the complementary nature of the immigrants’ skills.((/ul)) Matthew J. ((ul))Slaughter, a former member of the president’s Council of Economic Advisers, noted((/ul)) in a survey of immigration and productivity growth, ((ul))“((/ul))((ul))((hl))Skilled immigrants tend to complement, not substitute for, native((/hl))((/ul))((ul))-born ((/ul))((ul))((hl))workers in US companies((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). Companies that hire more skilled immigrants tend to hire more native-born workers as well.”((/ul))19 ","((ul))A rising share of immigrants in the labor market also encourages Ameri((/ul))((ul))cans to upgrade their skills with more education and to shift into areas of employment where language skills are more important and tend to be rewarded. As immigrants enter the workforce, Americans tend to stay in school longer to upgrade their skills and their potential earning power.((/ul)) A 2012 study found that an increase in the presence of immigrants in the workforce increased the probability that native-born Americans will stay in school and complete their high school education.20 Other research suggests that in states with a heavier concentration of less educated immigrants, native-born workers are more likely to shift to more communication-intensive occupations, where their language skills give them an advantage and where wages are typically higher than in manual jobs. This has the collective effect of raising the productivity of Americans in the workforce.21","Lower-skilled immigrants also boost productivity and output by supplying services that allow higher-skilled Americans to raise their productivity. The 2016 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) noted that low-skilled immigrants reduce the price US households pay for immigrant-intensive services such as childcare, eating out, house cleaning and repair, landscaping and gardening, taxi rides, and construction. The affordability of such services allows native-born workers in higher-salaried jobs, especially women, to increase their paid work hours.22","((ul))((hl))Immigrants promote faster US economic growth because they are generally more flexible about when and where they will work.((/hl))((/ul)) Immigrants have proven to be more geographically mobile. They are less likely to be rooted in one geographic location and are therefore more willing than natives to move to places where demand for their labor is higher than the supply.23 That can mean moving to urban centers of high-tech activity or to rural areas in need of specific kinds of labor, from agriculture to healthcare. They are also more willing to work unusual hours, at nights and on weekends, which provides more labor for the economy in a way that is less likely to compete directly with US-born workers.24 ((ul))Greater mobility serves the overall economy by reducing regional differences in employment and by allowing work to be spread out across time and space.((/ul))","In summary, immigrants do not ordinarily compete with Americans for a limited number of jobs; instead, they work with and for native-born workers in a cooperative way that lifts the general productivity and prosperity of the United States.","Immigrants Spur Innovation, Patents, and Startups","Immigrants create wealth in America by spurring innovation and founding new companies. ((ul))Highly skilled immigrants are more likely to file patent applications than their native-born counterparts and are more likely to start new businesses, fueling entrepreneurial activity, providing new products and services, and creating employment opportunities for native-born workers, while raising overall productivity.((/ul)) ((ul))The patenting and innovation spurred by immigrants allow the((/ul)) ((ul))U((/ul))nited ((ul))S((/ul))tates ((ul))to shift beyond its production possibility frontier, which raises the speed limit for the economy’s long-run growth potential.((/ul))","The 2016 NASEM report found that “immigrants are more innovative than natives; more specifically, ((ul))high-skilled immigrants raise patenting per capita, which is likely to boost productivity and per capita economic growth.”((/ul)) While immigrants account for 13 percent of the US population, they are responsible for one-third of all patent filings in the United States.25","The United States has been the world’s greatest beneficiary so far from the international mobility of skilled labor. The United States has attracted the largest net inflow of global inventors who have filed international patents. Based on data from the World Intellectual Property Organization from 2001 to 2010, a recent study determined that “the United States has received an enormous net surplus of inventors from abroad, while China and India have been major source countries.”26 Again, the prime example is Silicon Valley in California. The same study found that “more than half of the high-skilled technology workers and entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley are foreign-born.”27","((ul))Immigrants are also more likely to found new enterprises, from ethnic restaurants to billion-dollar technology companies.((/ul))28 Some of the most famous and successful US companies today were founded or cofounded by first- or second- generation immigrants. ((ul))According to a June 2017 report from the Massachusetts Technology Leadership Council, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))40 percent of America’s Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or the children of immigrants((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). A 2016 study by the National Foundation for American Policy found that more than half of the startup companies in the((/ul)) ((ul))U((/ul))nited ((ul))S((/ul))tates ((ul))today that are valued at more than $1 billion, so-called “unicorns,” were started by immigrants.((/ul)) The 44 unicorn companies founded by immigrants each employed an average of 760 workers.29","As one study of global talent flows concluded, “The weight of the evidence points to high-skilled immigrants boosting innovation and productivity—mainly through increased quantity of skilled individuals pursuing innovative work.”30","“Immigration Surplus” Raises Income of Americans","((ul))Immigrants fuel economic growth, wealth creation, and higher average incomes in the countries where they settle.((/ul)) The primary beneficiaries are the immigrants themselves, but native-born individuals are also net beneficiaries. ((ul))The economies of scale of a larger domestic economy, the economic diversity and complementarities, and the ideas, innovation, and entrepreneurship that immigrants bring create a net gain in wealth for their native counterparts.((/ul))","((ul))Economists call this the “immigration surplus.” It is the net gain available to natives when the economic costs from immigration are subtracted from the benefits.((/ul)) The number is typically small compared to America’s huge economy, but while estimates vary, they are invariably positive. Under conventional assumptions, the annual immigration surplus from the current stock of US immigrants is estimated to be in the range of 0.1 to 0.4 percent of US gross domestic product.31 That translates into $19 billion to $74 billion in today’s economy in the total net benefits accrued to native-born Americans from current levels of immigration.","In a comprehensive 2016 study of the economic impact of immigration on the economies of wealthier nations such as the United States, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded, “Immigration significantly increases GDP per capita in advanced economies.” Specifically, ((ul))the IMF study estimated that a one-percentage- point increase in the share of migrants in the adult population can ((/ul))((ul))raise GDP per capita by up to 2 percent((/ul))((ul)) in the long run, mainly through increased labor productivity.((/ul))32","((ul))The IMF study((/ul)) found that immigration had no measurable impact on income distribution in advanced economies. It ((ul))found that high-skilled immigration did have a larger benefit for the top 10 percent of earners, but the bottom 90 percent also benefited((/ul)). Low- and medium-skilled immigration “equally increases income per capita for the bottom 90 percent and the top 10 percent.”33","Immigration also exerts a positive influence on US government finances. In general, ((ul))immigrants tend to produce a fiscal surplus for the federal government, especially for its retirement programs, while imposing more immediate net costs on state and local governments, in particular because of education and ((/ul))((ul))incomesupport((/ul))((ul)) programs.((/ul)) ((ul))High-skilled immigrants produce large fiscal surpluses for the government((/ul)), while low-skilled immigrants tend to have a negative impact.","The NASEM report concluded that an immigrant who arrives in the United States at age 25 with a four-year college education will, over his or her lifetime, contribute a net surplus of $504,000 to the finances of governments at all levels (net present value, 2012 dollars). An immigrant with an advanced degree will contribute almost twice that net amount, $972,000, in his or her lifetime. An immigrant with less than a high school education, in contrast, will impose a net cost of $109,000 over his or her lifetime.34 The IMF study notes that such direct, static analysis may underestimate the full fiscal impact of immigration. A more “dynamic scoring” approach would take into account the spillover impact of immigration on productivity and GDP growth for the entire economy, an effect that further boosts tax revenue.35","In its landmark 2016 study of the economic and fiscal consequences of immigration, ((ul))NASEM concluded that immigration unambiguously contributes to US economic growth:((/ul))","Most obviously, ((ul))immigration supplies workers, which increases GDP and has helped the((/ul)) ((ul))U((/ul))nited ((ul))S((/ul))tates ((ul))avoid the fate of stagnant economies created by purely demographic forces—in particular, an aging((/ul)) (and, in the case of Japan, a shrinking) ((ul))workforce((/ul)).

Low birth rates may simply be a consequence of gender equality and overall prosperity: As a nation’s share of educated women grows, its fertility rate tends to decline, perhaps because working women don’t have the time, money, or interest in raising the sort of large families that were so common (and necessary) in agrarian economies.","Productivity growth is unpredictable, and fertility growth is elusive.

((ul))At present they are accelerating toward 400 ppm, and by 2050 they will reach 500 ppm, about double pre-industrial levels. Unfortunately, atmospheric CO2 lasts about a century, so there is no way immediately to reduce levels, only to slow their increase, we are thus in for significant global warming; the only debate is how much and how ((/ul))((ul))serous((/ul))((ul)) the effects will be.

Economist William Cline once estimated the damage to the United States alone from moderate levels of warming at 1-6 percent of GDP annually; severe warming could cost 13-26 percent of GDP. ((ul))But the most frightening scenario is runaway greenhouse warming, based on positive feedback from the buildup of water vapor in the atmosphere that is both caused by and causes hotter surface temperatures.((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))Past ice age transitions, associated with only 5-10 degree changes in average global temperatures, took place in just decades, even though no one was then pouring ever-increasing amounts of carbon into the atmosphere.((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))Faced with this specter, the best one can conclude is that “((/ul))((ul))((hl))humankind’s continuing enhancement of the natural greenhouse effect is akin to playing Russian roulette with the earth’s climate and humanity’s life support system.

China's Ministry of Science and Technology announced in November 2017 that it had formed a sort of dream team made up of the biggest Chinese tech firms — Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent — to lead the country's AI development alongside voice recognition software developer iFlytek. Each of these companies is hard at work cultivating the learning algorithms and hardware, and gathering the data, necessary to build a wide range of functional AI platforms.

In particular, ((ul))nuclear((/ul))((ul)) deterrence played a significant role in the way the U.S. built its national security strategy((/ul)). Nuclear deterrence was so pervasive that the very word “deterrence” itself became synonymous with nuclear deterrence. However, according to General John Hyten, Commander, U.S. Strategic Command, strategic deterrence in the 21st century does not equate to 20th century deterrence. ((ul))Strategic deterrence is a multi-polar, multi-domain problem and it is fundamentally different now than it was in last century. The myopic focus on nuclear options((/ul)) in a national deterrence strategy ((ul))falls short of the critical thinking required to provide U.S. national leaders with the options necessary for effective decision making.((/ul)) Today’s complex social-political environment requires more than just a nuclear element for strategic deterrence to be effective against a diverse set of adversaries. Deterrence today must leverage all six domains of warfare.","So what is deterrence? According to DoD Joint Publication 1, deterrence “influences potential adversaries not to take threatening actions” for fear of the overwhelming retaliation from U.S. military might. More simply, deterrence could be any action that convinces an adversary to not act due to perceived unacceptable costs or because “the probability of success [is assessed to be] extremely low.” For an adversary to believe costs will be unacceptable or that there is a low probability of success, it must assess the U.S. threat as credible and capable, regardless of whether it is nuclear or conventional. ((ul))((hl))Deterrence hinges on the adversary’s assessment of credibility and capability((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). ((/ul))During the Cold War the Soviet Union believed that use of nuclear weapons would lead to an overwhelming retaliation from the U.S.; and therefore, striking any NATO allies with nuclear weapons was not worth the cost.","Effects of a Multi-Polar Environment","The end of the Cold War brought to a close 50 years of a bi-polar world, and with it the simplicity of employing one strategy to deter a single adversary. ((ul))The multi-polar world of today brings adversaries who are motivated differently. Both rational and irrational actors must be considered((/ul)), which also causes national leaders to question the level of success strategic deterrence has on an adversary. Generally, it is believed strategic deterrence is effective only against a rational actor, and not an irrational actor. This is due to the perception that a rational actor will take into account some form of cost-benefit analysis prior to acting versus the irrational actor who might act without any consideration of the losses.","Further complicating the world environment is that ((ul))((hl))potential adversaries are watching and learning from U.S actions((/hl))((/ul)). This is not a new concept as adversaries have been studying each other for thousands of years to gain advantage. But General Hyten reminded us in a speech last fall that “in a multi-polar world, everybody watches you [the U.S.] everywhere.” His point was to highlight that ((ul))since the fall of the Soviet Union((/ul)), the U.S. has had a spotlight on it where ((ul))adversaries have been studying the asymmetric advantages of the U.S. and creating specific capabilities and methods to counter those advantages((/ul)). Thus, we must now recognize that ((ul))a deterrent method of the past may not be viable in the future((/ul))((ul)). ((/ul))((ul))((hl))The U.S. must seek out new deterrent strategies((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul))","Nuclear versus Strategic Deterrence","Nuclear deterrence remains the foundation of U.S. deterrence strategy. However, nuclear deterrence cannot be the sole pillar of strategic deterrence since nuclear deterrence is not a one-size-fits-all solution. The most recent National Security Strategy (NSS) reflects this requirement to expand deterrence. As Brian Willis points out in the recent “Multi-domain ops at the Strategic Level” article, the recent NSS and Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) make strides to extend deterrence to the space and cyberspace domains. ((ul))Creating non-nuclear deterrence options for use against potential adversaries is critical, especially against those actors who do not possess nuclear weapons.((/ul)) Michael Gerson suggests ((ul))the nuclear taboo reduces the credibility—and therefore the utility—of nuclear weapons, especially against regimes not possessing nuclear weapons or((/ul)) other ((ul))w((/ul))eapons of ((ul))m((/ul))ass ((ul))d((/ul))estruction. This thought process feeds back to the concept of credibility. The ((ul))adversary must know the capability exists and the U.S. is willing to use it. The U.S. must consider a more balanced approach to deterrence as two of its near-peer adversaries have done. China and Russia are starting to demonstrate new ideas and concepts about strategic deterrence.((/ul)) This new “deterrence” does not solely focus on nuclear weapons or even the military instrument of power. China defines this new way of thinking as “Integrated Strategic Deterrence” while the Russians have called it “Cross-Domain Coercion.”","People’s Republic of China Approach to Deterrence","The PRC’s approach is not focused on preventing actions in a given domain but about achieving certain political goals. Around 2001, PRC military literature started discussing a concept known as “Integrated Strategic Deterrence” which focuses on nonmilitary aspects of national power—diplomatic, economic, and scientific and technological strength—contributing to strategic deterrence alongside space and cyber capabilities. These actions could include demonstrating new capabilities through tests and exercises where international observers are watching, owning the majority of mineral mines that hold a certain type of element, or working with partner countries to launch a new satellite that helps map future droughts and plots areas that are farmable.","In 2007, the PRC tested an antisatellite (ASAT) technology demonstrator against a non-operational weather satellite. This test was publicized as a future scientific technology demonstration. This test demonstrated the PRC had a capability to engage satellites in Low Earth Orbit, which has now been turned over to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and is considered an operational military capability. It is also now a credible strategic deterrent in the space domain.","Another piece to the PRC’s deterrence is their dam building operations for water control and hydropower. According to open sources, the PRC owns 45% of the world’s dams with its nearest competitors being the United States at 14% and India at 9%. Dams have the potential to turn water into political weapons to be wielded in war, or instruments during peace to influence actions or behaviors of a neighbor. India is currently concerned with a number of China dam projects and their ability to reduce river flows into India.","The PRC’s “Integrated Strategic Deterrence” does not come without challenges. Unlike the U.S. who has the Department of Defense and Department of State coordinating different types of deterrent actions, the absence of an entity in the PLA to integrate and coordinate the employment of these capabilities makes it difficult to execute. However, it would come as no surprise to the casual observer to see the PLA start executing military, space, and cyber coercive activities in national level exercises in order to move “Integrated Strategic Deterrence” from theory and conjecture to fully operational in limited regional conflicts.","Russia’s Approach to Deterrence","The PRC is not the only competitor thinking about strategic deterrence from a non-nuclear perspective. About 30 years ago, Soviet literature introduced a concept we now know as Reflexive Control. This notion centers on the idea of driving your opponent to make decisions that are advantageous to you. This is commonly achieved through misinformation, either via “leaks” or providing a possible explanation to an unrelated event that causes your opponent to divert attention or respond. That concept has now evolved into “Cross-Domain Coercion.”","“Cross Domain Coercion” is Russia’s ability to orchestrate non-nuclear and informational influence to coerce an adversary. It maintains opaqueness that clouds the nature of aggression as well as the aggressor’s identity. This informational influence was apparent during both the United States elections in 2016 and Catalonia’s bid for independence from Spain in 2017. Multiple United States intelligence agencies have noted Russian misinformation on social media and mass media outlets. This campaign is a prime example of “Cross Domain Coercion” and used a soft instrument of power, in this case information, as a form of deterrence on a global scale. The purpose of this interference is still clouded but it must have satisfied Russian objectives if it was used in Catalonia months after the United States election.","Another form of this type of deterrence is Russia’s cyber-attacks in both Estonia in 2007, and Georgia in 2008. In both cases, the attacks were not solely focused on military targets but against government institutions, banks, ministries, newspapers, and broadcasters. These attacks were meant to confuse the population and drive the government towards compliance with Russian demands.","Whatever the objectives, Russia has telegraphed that future attacks will fall under “Cross Domain Coercion”. The threats against financial and economic institutions as well as those of energy sources will be activated in conjunction with the military component of coercion, such as special operations forces and strategic strike systems in order to influence the target country. With both the PRC and Russia, strategic deterrence is no longer monopolized by nuclear weapons. 21st century deterrence is dam building that has regional implications on precious resources and misinformation campaigns such as Deepfakes where machine learning systems can be trained to paste one person’s face onto another person’s body, complete with facial expressions, and could change the outcome of democratic elections.","U.S. Multi-Domain Strategic Deterrence","Consideration of deterrent effects other than kinetic weapons must be explored. ((ul))Strategic deterrence “applies to cyber, it applies to missile defense, and it applies to electronic warfare. It applies to every mission in U.S. Strategic Command.”((/ul)) Currently, ((ul))an adversarial attack can come through any domain, and that is why the U.S. must leverage the multiplicative advantages of all domains((/ul)). An adversary who is not deterred by a nuclear response may be deterred by fear of a cyber effect which degrades or destroys a country’s economic stability. Or it could be negotiations in the human domain which threaten sanctions against a country’s ability to trade. Maybe it is the threat of an information operations campaign with the goal of removing a governmental regime from power and destabilizing a nation state. Regardless of deterrence method, the adversary must perceive the U.S. as capable and willing to commit to the action for it to be an effective deterrent. The first step for the U.S. is talking about capabilities more openly so adversaries know about our capabilities and the conditions under which they would be employed. This does not mean we share the technical details of a capability, those should remain secret, but a general understanding of the effect created by the capability must be understood. Adversaries are not deterred by a capability if they do not know it exists.","Future Technologies and Deterrence","((ul))Technologies on the horizon have huge implications for the future of strategic deterrence.((/ul)) Hypersonic weapons have the capability of delivering multiple payload types to worldwide targets while rendering missile warning detection and missile defense programs obsolete.","Quantum computing has the ability to make encryption unbreakable unless you have quantum technology and increase transmission speeds to levels unheard of in today’s environment.

Governance shortfalls also will drive threat perceptions and insecurity in countries such as Pakistan and North Korea. Economic interdependence among major powers remains a check on aggressive behavior but might be insufficient in itself to prevent a future conflict. Major and middle powers alike will search for ways to reduce the types of interdependence that leaves them vulnerable to economic coercion and financial sanctions, potentially providing them more freedom of action to aggressively pursue their interests. Meanwhile, ((ul))the threat from terrorism is likely to expand((/ul)) as the ability of states, groups, and individuals to impose harm diversifies. The net effect of rising tensions within and between countries—and the growing threat from terrorism—will be greater global disorder and considerable questions about the rules, institutions, and distribution of power in the international system. Europe. Europe’s sharpening tensions and doubts about its future cohesion stem from institutions mismatched to its economic and security challenges. EU institutions set monetary policy for Eurozone states, but state capitals retain fiscal and security responsibilities—leaving poorer members saddled with debt and diminished growth prospects and each state determining its own approach to security. Public frustration with immigration, slow growth, and unemployment will fuel nativism and a preference for national solutions to continental problems. Outlook: Europe is likely to face additional shocks—banks remain unevenly capitalized and regulated, migration within and into Europe will continue, and Brexit will encourage regional and separatist movements in other European countries. Europe’s aging population will undermine economic output, shift consumption toward services—like health care—and away from goods and investment. A shortage of younger workers will reduce tax revenues, fueling debates over immigration to bolster the workforce. The EU’s future will hinge on its ability to reform its institutions, create jobs and growth, restore trust in elites, and address public concerns that immigration will radically alter national cultures. United States. ((ul))The next five years will test US resilience((/ul)). As in Europe, ((ul))tough economic times have brought out societal and class divisions((/ul)). Stagnant wages and rising income inequality are fueling doubts about global economic integration and the “American Dream” of upward mobility. The share of American men age 25- 54 not seeking work is at the highest level since the Great Depression. ((ul))Median incomes rose by 5 percent in 2015((/ul)), however, ((ul))and there are signs of renewal in some communities((/ul)) where real estate is affordable, returns on foreign and domestic investment are high, leveraging of immigrant talent is the norm, and expectations of federal assistance are low, according to contemporary observers. Outlook: Despite signs of economic improvement, ((ul))challenges will be significant, with public trust in leaders and institutions sagging((/ul)), politics highly polarized, ((ul))and government revenue constrained((/ul)) by modest growth and rising entitlement outlays. Moreover, advances in robotics and artificial intelligence are likely to further disrupt labor markets. Meanwhile, ((ul))((hl))uncertainty((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) is high ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))around the world((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) regarding Washington’s ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))global leadership role((/hl))((/ul)). The United States has rebounded from troubled times before, however, such as when the period of angst in the 1970s was followed by a stronger economic recovery and global role in the world. Innovation at the state and local level, flexible financial markets, tolerance for risk-taking, and a demographic profile more balanced than most large countries offer upside potential. Finally, America is distinct because it was founded on an inclusive ideal—the pursuit of life, liberty, and happiness for all, however imperfectly realized—rather than a race or ethnicity. This legacy remains a critical advantage for managing divisions. ((ul))Central and South America((/ul)). Although state weakness and drug trafficking have and will continue to beset Central America, South America has been more stable than most regions of the world and has had many democratic advances—including recovery from populist waves from the right and the left. However, ((ul))government efforts to provide greater economic and social stability are running up against budget and debt constraints((/ul)). Weakened international demand for commodities has slowed growth. The expectations associated with new entrants to the middle class will strain public coffers, fuel political discontent, and possibly jeopardize the region’s significant progress against poverty and inequality. Activist civil society organizations are likely to fuel social tensions by increasing awareness of elite corruption, inadequate infrastructure, and mismanagement. Some incumbents facing possible rejection by their publics are seeking to protect their power, which could lead to a period of intense political competition and democratic backsliding in some countries. Violence is particularly rampant in northern Central America, as gangs and organized criminal groups have undermined basic governance by regimes that lack capacity to provide many basic public goods and services. Outlook: ((ul))Central and South America are likely to see more frequent changes in governments that are mismanaging the economy and beleaguered by widespread corruption((/ul)). Leftist administrations already have lost power in places like Argentina, Guatemala, and Peru and are on the defensive in Venezuela, although new leaders will not have much time to show they can improve conditions. The success or failure of Mexico’s high-profile reforms might affect the willingness of other countries in the region to take similar political risks. The OECD accession process may be an opportunity—and incentive— for some countries to improve economic policies in a region with fairly balanced age demographics, significant energy resources, and well-established economic links to Asia, Europe, and the United States. ((ul))((hl))An ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))Inward West((/hl))((/ul))? Among the industrial democracies of North America, Europe, Japan, South Korea, and Australia, leaders will search for ways to restore a sense of middle class wellbeing while some attempt to temper populist and nativist impulses. The result ((ul))((hl))could((/hl))((/ul)) be a more inwardly focused West than we have experienced in decades, which will ((ul))((hl))seek to avoid((/hl))((/ul)) ((ul))costly ((/ul))((ul))((hl))foreign adventures((/hl))((/ul)) while experimenting with domestic schemes to address fiscal limits, demographic problems, and wealth concentrations. This inward view will be far more pronounced in the European Union, which is absorbed by questions of EU governance and domestic challenges, than elsewhere. The European Union’s internal divisions, demographic woes, and moribund economic performance threaten its own status as a global player. For the coming five years at least, the need to restructure European relations in light of the UK’s decision to leave the EU will undermine the region’s international clout and could weaken transatlantic cooperation, while anti-immigration sentiments among the region’s populations will undermine domestic political support for Europe’s political leaders.

Much of the world’s best talent seeks to live and work in the United States, and domestic and global hope for a competent and constructive foreign policy remain high. China. ((ul))China faces a daunting test((/ul))—with its political stability in the balance. After three decades of historic economic growth and social change, ((ul))Beijing, amid slower growth and the aftereffects of a debt binge, is transitioning from an investment-driven, export-based economy to one fueled by domestic consumption. ((/ul))Satisfying the demands of its new middle classes for clean air, affordable houses, improved services, and continued opportunities will be essential for the government to maintain legitimacy and political order. President Xi’s consolidation of power could threaten an established system of stable succession, while ((ul))((hl))Chinese nationalism((/hl))((/ul))—a force Beijing occasionally encourages for support when facing foreign friction—((ul))((hl))may prove hard to control((/hl))((/ul)). Outlook: ((ul))((hl))Beijing((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) probably has((/ul)) ample ((ul))resources to prop up growth while efforts to spur private consumption take hold.((/ul)) Nonetheless, the more it “doubles down” on state owned enterprises (SOEs) in the economy, the more it ((ul))((hl))will be at((/hl))((/ul)) greater ((ul))((hl))risk of ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))financial shocks((/hl))((/ul)) that cast doubt on its ability to manage the economy. Automation and competition from lowcost producers elsewhere in Asia and even Africa will put pressure on wages for unskilled workers. The country’s rapidly shrinking working-age population will act as a strong headwind to growth. ((ul))((hl))Russia((/hl))((/ul)). Russia’s ((ul))((hl))aspires to ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))restore((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) its ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))great power status((/hl))((/ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((ul))((hl))through ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))nationalism((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), military modernization, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))nuclear saber rattling((/hl))((/ul)), ((ul))((hl))and((/hl))((/ul)) ((ul))((hl))foreign engagements((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) abroad((/ul)). Yet, at home, it faces increasing constraints as its stagnant economy heads into a third consecutive year of recession. Moscow prizes stability and order, offering Russians security at the expense of personal freedoms and pluralism. ((ul))Moscow’s ability to retain a role on the global stage((/ul))—even ((ul))through disruption((/ul))—((ul))has also become a source of regime power and popularity at home((/ul)). Russian nationalism features strongly in this story, with President Putin praising Russian culture as the last bulwark of conservative Christian values against the decadence of Europe and the tide of multiculturalism. Putin is personally popular, but approval ratings of 35 percent for the ruling party reflect public impatience with deteriorating quality of life conditions and abuse of power. Outlook: If the Kremlin’s tactics falter, Russia will become vulnerable to domestic instability driven by dissatisfied elites— even as a decline in status suggests more aggressive international action. Russia’s demographic picture has improved somewhat since the 1990s but remains bleak. Life expectancy among males is the lowest of the industrial world, and its population will continue to decline. The longer Moscow delays diversifying its economy, the more the government will stoke nationalism and sacrifice personal freedoms and pluralism to maintain control. An Increasingly Assertive China and Russia. ((ul))((hl))Beijing((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) and ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))Moscow((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) will seek to lock in((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) temporary ((/ul))((ul))((hl))competitive advantages((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) and to right what they charge are historical wrongs((/ul)) before economic and demographic headwinds further slow their material progress and the West regains its footing. Both China and Russia maintain worldviews in which they are rightfully dominant in their regions and able to shape regional politics and economics to suit their security and material interests. ((ul))Both have moved aggressively in recent years to ((/ul))((ul))exert greater influence((/ul))((ul)) in their regions, to contest the US geopolitically, and to force Washington to accept exclusionary regional spheres of influence((/ul))—a situation that the United States has historically opposed. For example, China views the continuing presence of the US Navy in the Western Pacific, the centrality of US alliances in the region, and US protection of Taiwan as outdated and representative of the continuation of China’s “100 years of humiliation.” Recent Sino-Russian cooperation has been tactical, however, and is likely to return to competition if Beijing jeopardizes Russian interests in Central Asia and as Beijing enjoys more options for cheap energy supply beyond Russia. Moreover, it is not clear whether there is a mutually acceptable border between what China and Russia consider their natural spheres of influence. Meanwhile, India’s growing economic power and profile in the region will further complicate these calculations, as New Delhi navigates relations with Beijing, Moscow, and Washington to protect its own expanding interests.

Similarly, Moscow will become more active in the Middle East and those parts of the world in which it believes it can check US influence.

In the technology industry, this advance is known as Moore’s Law. It’s not just in computer hardware; the same exponential growth is happening in an assortment of other technologies.","Take the manufacturing industry.

There are similar advances happening in other fields where technology can be applied. Google is developing an Artificial Intelligence–based self-driving car that can change the face of cities by eliminating the need for parking spots, eliminate highway fatalities and traffic congestion, and dramatically reduce fuel consumption.

More than 20,000 of the green cards each year are devoted to immigrant investors, workers for jobs that don’t require a college degree, religious workers and others. More importantly, dependents (spouses and children) count against the 140,000 annual limit, accounting for about half of the total each year.","Third, the Immigration Act of 1990 unwisely retained per-country limits on employment-based immigrants. This continues to make no sense. It would be discrimination if a company said it will only hire a certain number of people of Chinese origin this year, yet collectively U.S. employers are only allowed to gain permanent residence for a limited number of people from any one country.

Some of these existential risks are fairly well known, especially the natural ones. But others are obscure or even exotic. Most worrying to Bostrom is the subset of existential risks that arise from human technology, a subset that he expects to grow in number and potency over the next century.¶ Despite his concerns about the risks posed to humans by technological progress, Bostrom is no luddite. In fact, he is a longtime advocate of transhumanism---the effort to improve the human condition, and even human nature itself, through technological means. In the long run he sees technology as a bridge, a bridge we humans must cross with great care, in order to reach new and better modes of being. In his work, Bostrom uses the tools of philosophy and mathematics, in particular probability theory, to try and determine how we as a species might achieve this safe passage. What follows is my conversation with Bostrom about some of the most interesting and worrying existential risks that humanity might encounter in the decades and centuries to come, and about what we can do to make sure we outlast them.¶ Some have argued that we ought to be directing our resources toward humanity's existing problems, rather than future existential risks, because many of the latter are highly improbable. You have responded by suggesting that ((ul))existential risk mitigation may in fact be a ((/ul))((ul))dominant moral priority((/ul))((ul)) over the alleviation of present suffering((/ul)). Can you explain why? ¶ Bostrom: Well ((ul))suppose you have a moral view that counts future people as being worth as much as present people((/ul)). You might say that fundamentally it doesn't matter whether someone exists at the current time or at some future time, just as many people think that from a fundamental moral point of view, it doesn't matter where somebody is spatially---somebody isn't automatically worth less because you move them to the moon or to Africa or something. ((ul))A human life is a human life. If you have that moral point of view that future generations matter in proportion to their population numbers, then you get this ((/ul))((ul))very stark implication that existential risk mitigation has a ((/ul))((ul))much higher utility((/ul))((ul)) than pretty much anything else that you could do.

((ul))But this does not mean that, each of us should commit suicide((/ul)). I commented on this in chapter two when I presented the idea that ((ul))((hl))utilitarianism should be applied((/hl))((/ul)), not only to individual actions, but ((ul))((hl))to collective actions((/hl))((/ul)) as well.¶ It is a well-known fact that people rarely commit suicide. Some even claim that no one who is mentally sound commits suicide. Could that be taken as evidence for the claim that people live lives worth living? That would be rash. Many people are not utilitarians. They may avoid suicide because they believe that it is morally wrong to kill oneself. ((ul))It is((/ul)) also ((ul))a possibility that,((/ul)) ((ul))((hl))even if people lead lives not worth living, they believe they do((/hl))((/ul)). And ((ul))((hl))even if some may believe that their lives, up to now, have not been worth living((/hl))((/ul))((hl)), ((/hl))((ul))((hl))their future lives will be better((/hl))((/ul)). They may be mistaken about this. They may hold false expectations about the future.¶ From the point of view of evolutionary biology, it is natural to assume that people should rarely commit suicide. If we set old age to one side, it has poor survival value (of one’s genes) to kill oneself. So it should be expected that it is difficult for ordinary people to kill themselves. But then theories about cognitive dissonance, known from psychology, should warn us that we may come to believe that we live better lives than we do.¶ ((ul))My strong belief is that((/ul)) ((ul))most of us live lives worth living((/ul)). However, I do believe that our lives are close to the point where they stop being worth living. But then it is at least not very far-fetched to think that they may be worth not living, after all. My assessment may be too optimistic.¶ Let us just ((ul))for the sake of the argument assume that our lives are not worth living, and let us accept that, if this is so, we should all kill ourselves((/ul)). As I noted above, ((ul))this does not answer the question what we should do, each one of us((/ul)). My conjecture is that ((ul))we should not commit suicide((/ul)). The explanation is simple. ((ul))If I kill myself, many people will suffer((/ul)). Here is a rough explanation of how this will happen: ¶ ... suicide “survivors” confront a complex array of feelings. Various forms of guilt are quite common, such as that arising from (a) the belief that one contributed to the suicidal person's anguish, or (b) the failure to recognize that anguish, or (c) the inability to prevent the suicidal act itself. ((ul))Suicide((/ul)) also ((ul))leads to rage, loneliness, and awareness of vulnerability in those left behind((/ul)). Indeed, the sense that suicide is an essentially selfish act dominates many popular perceptions of suicide. ¶ ((ul))The fact that all our lives lack meaning((/ul)), ((ul))if they do, does not mean that others will follow my example((/ul)). They will go on with their lives and their false expectations — at least for a while devastated because of my suicide. But then I have an obligation, for their sake, to go on with my life. It is highly likely that, by committing suicide, I create more suffering (in their lives) than I avoid (in my life)."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":164}}]}
