After President Donald Trump was sworn in, he rolled out more policies against globalization and focused on America’s interest.The US President believes immigrants are a key reason for terrorism that threatens the US homeland security and also for the unemployment problem. On January 27th, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order titled “Protecting the Nation from foreign terrorists entry into the United States” (the socalled “Muslim ban”). The measure prohibited for a period of three months the entry into the US of citizens from seven countries. The ban halted the Refugees Admission Program for 120 days, and suspended indefinitely the reestablishment in the USA of a Syrian refugee program launched by the Obama administration. Besides, the US media revealed that Trump government also intended to issue a decree to cancel the H1-B Visa Lottery system that prioritizes foreign students graduating from the US higher education institutions. The Draft Decree also was reported to revoke the Obama administration’s policy to extend from 12 to 36 months the STEM OPT (Optional Practical Training for students with Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics degrees). These new immigration policy measures encountered strong opposition both at home and abroad, especially the science and technology community. Even though the American Federal Judiciary has blocked the “Muslim ban”, ((ul))Trump’s attitude against globalization leads us to believe that the restrictions on immigrants might still be enacted((/ul)) one day in the future. ","On the contrary, ((ul))((hl))China is currently reforming the immigration policies with an aim to establish a more((/hl))((/ul)) open and ((ul))((hl))flexible system to attract international talent((/hl))((/ul))((hl))s((/hl)). In December, 2012, the Organization Department of the Central Committee of CPC, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and other 25 government agencies jointly issued the “Administrative Measures on Entitlement of Foreigners with Chinese Permanent Residence”. In June, 2015, the Ministry of Public Security expanded the fields in which foreigners who apply for a Chinese Permanent Residence (Chinese Green Card) can work, based on the regulations of the “Measures for the Administration of Examination and Approval of Foreigners’ Permanent Residence in China”. Since then, Beijing, Shanghai, Fujian, and Guangdong, among other places, adopted new policy measures for the issuance of visa and residence permits to foreigners, to build a more open and flexible environment for them to live and work in China. In March, 2016, Zhongguancun became the first area to pilot the 20 new entry and exit policies for foreigners adopted by the Ministry of Public Security to support mass innovation in Beijing. These measures are expected to make it easier for foreign talent to enter and exit China to start their own business.","On Feb. 6th, 2017, the central government made a step forward in the immigration policy reforms and required the effort to improve the permanent residence permit system, as it is required by the national talent development strategy.

((ul))The report((/ul)), conducted by C4ADS, an American data-driven research nonprofit, ((ul))examined ((/ul))((ul))15 Chinese port deals((/ul))((ul)) across the Indian Ocean region((/ul)).

((/ul))“The trends across the ports we looked at seem to indicate that ((ul))China is not upholding a ‘win-win’ idea, but is pursuing an ulterior motive((/ul)),” says Devin Thorne, one of the report’s co-authors. The accumulation of similar projects from Cambodia to Pakistan reinforces concerns that Beijing is using business bridgeheads for political and military purposes. “It’s more a layering of one deal after another — one by itself is not nefarious, but taken all together…” says Ben Spevack, another co-author. Most important, what a few years ago appeared a distant fear now seems to be coming to pass. ((ul))((hl))The((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) Chinese ((/ul))((ul))((hl))government is((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) using ((/ul))((ul))((hl))state-owned companies((/hl))((/ul)) and politically linked private firms ((ul))((hl))to create((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) a network of f((/ul))((ul))((hl))acilities designed to((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) provide logistical ((/ul))((ul))((hl))support((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) to ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Chinese warships patrolling the Indian Ocean((/hl))((/ul)), the report says, citing a Chinese analyst who lays out a “first civilian, later military” approach to port development across the region. Chinese warships are already taking advantage of the dual-use possibilities of commercial ports, bolstered by laws that oblige Chinese transportation firms working overseas to provide replenishment for navy vessels. In 2016 in Thailand, the dock landing ship Changbai Shan relied on a Chinese company operating there to get “one-stop” replenishment services, the C4ADS report notes. “We have deepened the integration of military and civilian forces, given full play to the advantages of our commercial resources abroad, and provided quality services to the warships of the motherland,” said the general manager of an unnamed Chinese company that serviced the Changbai Shan, according to a Chinese-language article. The ship’s captain said that anywhere there are Chinese companies, there are advance transportation guarantees for warships. It’s not just Thailand. While developing the so-called Maritime Silk Road, Chinese firms have snapped up control of ports in Cambodia, Indonesia, the Strait of Malacca, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Djibouti. Adm. Harry Harris, the head of U.S. Pacific Command, warned Congress earlier this year that China’s naval “presence and influence are expanding” thanks in large part to the commercial network created by the Belt and Road Initiative. One former U.S. military officer who served in the U.S. Pacific Command, who spoke on condition of anonymity, sees a historical parallel in Beijing’s acquisition spree. “It looks like coaling stations for the Dutch or British Empire, the way they set these up,” the former officer says.“It looks like coaling stations for the Dutch or British Empire, the way they set these up,” the former officer says. China’s expanding footprint in the Indian Ocean includes its first formal overseas base, in Djibouti, which has raised concern among U.S. officials, including Adm. Harris. But ((ul))commercial ports((/ul)) that can do double duty ((ul))are((/ul)) arguably ((ul))just as important for a navy seeking to transform itself into a true global force that can police the trade lines critical to China’s economy((/ul)). “China is pursuing a ‘places, not bases,’ strategy,” says retired U.S. Rear Adm. Mike McDevitt, a senior fellow at CNA, a nonprofit research organization. It’s the outgrowth of the Chinese navy’s first overseas mission in centuries, the anti-piracy patrols off the coast of Somalia that began exactly a decade ago. The only way to keep the ships supplied, Chinese leaders realized, was to rely on the existing port operations of state-owned China Ocean Shipping (Group) Company, or COSCO, one of the world’s biggest shipping outfits. “COSCO primed the pump to make them realize the advantage of commercial entities,” McDevitt says. Chinese leaders remain deeply concerned that hostile foreign powers could cut off critical supplies of energy that must cross the Indian Ocean and the Strait of Malacca, McDevitt notes. “What they’re doing is putting in place facilities that will enable them to have warships do protective operations” like the anti-piracy patrols. Despite periodic hand-wringing in Washington and New Delhi about Chinese efforts to build a “string of pearls” across the Indian Ocean, Beijing’s ambitions in the region were still unclear for much of the last decade. China got control of a deepwater port in Gwadar, Pakistan, and strong-armed the Sri Lankan government into control of ports there. But it was unclear how those projects meshed with Beijing’s stated goal of becoming a first-class naval power. “It wasn’t yet the coherent and cohesive strategy that it’s become,” says Evan Medeiros, who oversaw Asia policy in the Barack Obama White House and is now at the Eurasia Group. Now ((ul))that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))strategy is coming into focus((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)), the((/hl))((/ul)) C4ADS ((ul))((hl))report concluded after((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) scouring((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) corporate registries and ((/ul))((ul))((hl))years of writing by Chinese analysts and military officers((/hl))((/ul)). “((ul))Chinese analysts((/ul)), particularly those with military backgrounds, ((ul))describe port investments as discreetly enabling China to enhance its military presence in the Indo-Pacific((/ul)),” the report notes. ((ul))((hl))It’s still a work in progress((/hl))((/ul)). Nearly all the port projects include plans for some type of Chinese-led industrial development nearby, including shipbuilding and metallurgical facilities, which could eventually make the ports more useful as logistic hubs, though few have been developed."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":66}},{"tag":"((hl))Chinese presence in the Indian Ocean sparks a great power war((/hl))","cite":"((hl))Lintner 17((/hl)) — (Bertil Lintner, 6-19-2017, \"A New Cold War in the Indian Ocean?,\" Published by National Interest, http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/new-cold-war-the-indian-ocean-21227?page=show, Accessed 6-5-2018, JWS)","text":["((ul))((hl))A new ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))Cold ((/ul))((ul))((hl))War is brewing in the Indian Ocean((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), with an informal alliance of the United States, India, Australia, Japan on one side and China on the other((/ul)). While tensions in the ocean are not yet as pitched as in the hotly contested South China Sea, ((ul))((hl))the potential for conflict is((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) unmistakably ((/ul))((ul))((hl))rising((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) in the high ((/ul))((ul))stakes((/ul))((ul)) strategic theater((/ul)). More than 60% of the world’s oil shipments pass through the Indian Ocean, largely from the Middle East’s oil fields to China, Japan and other fuel-importing Asian economies, as does 70% of all container traffic to and from Asia’s industrialized nations and the rest of the world. While traffic across the Atlantic has diminished in recent years and that which crosses the Pacific is mainly static, trade through the Indian Ocean is fast growing. Maintaining the security of that trade and other navigation is the ostensible reason for the annual Malabar naval exercises between India, Japan and the United States. For the first time in modern history, ((ul))China is making its own inroads into the Indian Ocean((/ul)) region ((ul))to protect its trade routes((/ul)) and energy supplies. ((ul))Although this may appear innocuous((/ul)) on the surface, ((ul))it is has put China on((/ul)) what could become ((ul))a collision course with the US and its regional allies((/ul)) — hence the new informal, anti-China oriented alliance in the region. Strategic ripples are gathering. At Obock in Djibouti, situated on the Horn of Africa and overlooking the southern gateway to the Red Sea and the Suez Canal, China has established its first foreign military base, ostensibly to fight piracy. Yet the facility is located next to a key US military facility, also in Djibouti. More importantly, it is also close to other bigger US bases in the region, including a huge facility at Diego Garcia just south of the Equator in the Indian Ocean, as well as US installations in Gulf countries. China’s main regional rival, ((ul))India((/ul)), ((ul))has always considered the Indian Ocean as its “own lake”((/ul)) in South Asian sphere of influence. ((ul))As such, New Delhi is known to be extremely worried about China’s growing forays into the region((/ul)), especially as security officials have observed Chinese submarine activity uncomfortably close to its Andaman and Nicobar Islands. In 2001, India created a new Far Eastern Naval Command (FENC) based on those archipelagos to protect its interests in the region. The plan for its establishment was reportedly hatched in 1995 after a closed-door meeting in Washington between India’s then prime minister P. V. Narasimha Rao and US president Bill Clinton. The plan was finalized when Clinton visited India in 2000. As Indian journalist Sudha Ramachandran wrote in Asia Times on October 19, 2005: “FENC will have state-of-the-art naval electronic warfare systems that can extend as far as Southeast Asia.” FENC is also India’s first and only joint command that includes the army, the navy and the air force with two naval bases, 15 ships, four air force and naval air bases, and two army brigades. Australia, which controls the strategically situated territories of Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, appears equally concerned about China’s recent emergence in the Indian Ocean. Australia’s signals intelligence facility on the Cocos closely monitors movements in the maritime region. If superpower rivalry between the US and China, or increased tension between China and India, comes to a head in the Indian Ocean, then Australia will be well-placed to defend its interests and aid allies. And then there is France, which does not take part in joint naval exercises but is a US partner in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). While the least prominent of the regional powers, because of its possession of small islands scattered across the maritime region, its exclusive economic zone in the Indian Ocean measures 2.5 million square kilometers. Apart from its overseas departments of Mayotte and Réunion, France controls the huge, non-inhabited island of Kerguelen and nearby Crozet Archipelago and Ile St Paul et Ile Amsterdam, as well as smaller uninhabited islands around and east of the African island nation of Madagascar. There is a satellite tracking facility on Kerguelen and about a hundred “scientists” based on the Crozet Archipelago and St Paul-Amsterdam on a rotation basis. The French military also has an infantry regiment on La Réunion, and the French Foreign Legion is present on Mayotte to help guard its far-flung regional interests, many rooted in its past colonial era. ((ul))China’s((/ul)) new and highly touted “One Belt One Road” (((ul))Obor((/ul))) initiative, unveiled in October 2013 to extend the region’s infrastructure and promote more trade, ((ul))underlines Beijing’s intention to become a global power((/ul)). “The Silk Road Economic Belt” alludes to the old Silk Road, which in ancient times connected the East and the West along trade routes from Europe through Central Asia to China. But given conflicts and political instability in countries along that route, “the Maritime Silk Road” through the Indian Ocean is bound to become the more important of the two initiatives. Not since Zheng He, a Muslim eunuch from China’s southwestern province of Yunnan, sailed his fleets through the Indian Ocean in the 15th century — and then explored and mapped the region in a bid to impose imperial control over trade, win favor with the areas’ peoples, and extend the empire’s tributary system — has China been as present in the region. That empire eventually fell with wars at home, and in subsequent centuries China was not even remotely a naval power. The republic, which was established in 1912, concentrated mainly on riverine warfare and was no match for the then Imperial Japanese Navy, which fortified Tokyo’s occupation of Chinese territories in the 1930s and 1940s. Until the late 1980s, the navy of the People’s Republic of China, was also a brown-water force, meaning it did not have the deep water reach of the US and other naval powers. It was not until the 1990s, following the fall of the Soviet Union and a shift towards more assertive foreign and security policies, that China’s leaders looked past land border disputes and turned their attention towards the oceans. By then, China was also becoming an economic power that needed a strong military, including a navy, to protect its trade and other maritime interests. Today, ((ul))((hl))as China’s((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))forays in the Indian Ocean((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) and countering joint naval exercises ((/ul))((ul))((hl))show((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), ((/ul))((ul))((hl))potential ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))great power battle lines are forming((/hl))((/ul)).

The reports also claim that Chinese troops have built bunkers on a ridge near the disputed area and there are concerns that the standoff could resume. ((ul))Neither side is going to lower its guard((/ul))((ul)) by pulling troops back too far((/ul)). ((ul))Reputational costs weigh heavily((/ul)). New Delhi cannot abandon Bhutan — India’s only treaty ally in South Asia — to Beijing’s bullying and blandishments. For Beijing, the central message of India’s defiance — “China will stop only when it’s stopped” — could encourage further acts of defiance by other adversaries. Having been outmaneuvered and outwitted by Delhi, Beijing may seek to bolster its military capabilities in Doklam. Whether imperial or communist, China has a long history of lashing out at states that hurt its pride and interests. It seems the so-called Pacific Century may turn out to be just another hundred bloody years in Asia. In fact, ((ul))skirmishes and ((/ul))((ul))((hl))military face-offs have been a regular feature on their contested borders((/hl))((/ul)), rife with disputed histories. Numerous pacts and border management mechanisms established over the decades have failed to maintain peace and Asia’s giants have come close to fighting for a second round along their long, disputed Himalayan border at least once a decade since the late 1960s.

Thus, at a time when the whole world is China’s oyster, India is the only Asian country standing athwart China’s march to glory and greatness. Not surprisingly, the enemy most often spoken of in Beijing’s strategic circles today is India. The censors encourage alarmingly frank discussion of the merits of another war against India. In particular, China has been concerned about India moving too close to the United States and Japan for Beijing’s comfort. From Beijing’s perspective, as long as India understands that China is the preeminent great power in Asia, and New Delhi keeps its subordinate place in the hierarchy, both will enjoy a mutually beneficial relationship. However, should India challenge or aspire to emerge as China’s equal or peer competitor — and to do so with help from Japan and the United States — then the entire gamut of contentious bilateral issues are open for review and recasting. Convinced that India has opted for the latter course, ((ul))((hl))the Chinese government has hardened its((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) stance ((/ul))((ul))((hl))and unleashed a((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) shrill ((/ul))((ul))((hl))media campaign against India((/hl))((/ul)). Not very accustomed to weaker powers pushing back, Chinese official statements have been among the most belligerent and contemptuous since the 1960s. ((ul))China’s defense ministry spokesman repeatedly called on India to “correct its mistakes and stop its provocations.”((/ul)) This campaign — unusual in its sarcasm and ridicule of Indian aspirations with daily threats and warnings — has mobilized Chinese public support for punitive action against its southern rival at an appropriate time and place. ((ul))((hl))It is worth remembering that several military stand-offs((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) and skirmishes ((/ul))((ul))((hl))eventually culminated in the Sino-Indian War of 1962((/hl))((/ul)). The periodic Himalayan standoffs have their origins in the deep-seated hostility and suspicion that China and India have for one another. My book China and India: Great Power Rivals argued that given the fundamental clash of interests rooted in their history, strategic cultures and geopolitics, ((ul))the threat of another war is ever present((/ul)). For Asia has never known both China and India growing strong simultaneously in such close proximity with overlapping spheres of influence. India perceives itself in southern Asia much as China has traditionally perceived itself in relation to eastern Asia — as the preeminent power. Both aspire to the same things at the same time on the same continental landmass and its adjoining waters. As their need for resources, markets and bases grows, Asia’s rising powers are also increasingly running into each other in third countries. China’s global clout is manifesting itself in a millennia-old sense of superiority in Chinese behavior as Beijing seeks to recast the world in its own image. ((ul))India’s rise presents serious challenges to China((/ul)). ((ul))Their power rivalry and their self-images as natural great powers((/ul)) and centers of civilization ((ul))drive them to support different countries and causes((/ul)). Since India was never part of the Sinic world order, but a civilization-empire in and of itself, it remains genetically ill-disposed to sliding into China’s orbit without resistance. It is the only Asian power that has long been committed to balancing China. Economic, military and demographic trends over the long term tend to favor India. Compared with the United States, Russia and Japan — all in relative decline, India is the only country whose power and influence vis-à-vis China is increasing over time. New economic prosperity and military strength is reawakening nationalist pride in India, which could bring about a clash with the Chinese, if not handled skillfully. The emergence of a democratic, but at-times chaotic, India as the fastest growing world economy undercuts “the China model” of development-without-democracy. Add to this mix India’s growing military cooperation with the United States, Japan and Australia, and growing strategic ties with countries that fall within China’s sphere of influence (Mongolia, South Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines and Myanmar). All of these “new irritants” reinforce Beijing’s fears about India’s growing role in the U.S.-led containment of China. Furthermore, Chinese diplomats have discerned a certain degree of assertiveness, confidence and arrogance in their Indian counterparts that was missing in the 1980s and 1990s. When Chinese and Indian leaders meet, there is little meeting of the minds. Many analysts believe that growing power asymmetry, in particular Beijing’s global economic clout, is the reason for Chinese derision and bellicosity toward India. However, I argue that the roots of Chinese hostility toward its southern rival are deep-seated and actually pre-date Beijing’s acquisition of economic and military muscle. An understanding of Chinese perceptions of India insofar as they influence policy is important because the present tensions may or may not erupt in a hot war, but will surely make their cold war colder. These perceptions have led five successive generations of post-Mao Chinese leadership to contemplate “teach[ing] India a lesson again” at least once every decade since the 1962 War (Zhou Enlai in 1971, Deng Xiaoping in 1987, Jiang Zemin in 1999, Hu Jintao in 2009 and Xi Jinping in 2017). India is “an artificial British creation” Since Mao’s days, Chinese leaders have entertained doubts about the historical authenticity of the Indian nation. They have shown contempt for India’s great power ambitions, perceived their southern rival as a pawn in Western designs to contain China, and worried about the strategic ramifications of India’s power with regard to Tibet’s future. Official rhetoric of Asian solidarity or millennia-old civilizational bonds notwithstanding, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) stereotype of India is of a loathsome, backward neighbor that sold opium to China, sent soldiers to crush the Boxer rebellion, provided Sikh policemen for the pre-1949 international settlements in Shanghai, copied British parliamentary democracy, adopted English as its official language, gave refuge to the Dalai Lama and Tibetan “splittists,” and, last but not least, pursued British India’s expansionist policies. The 1962 War and the Sino-Pakistan military nexus helped to tilt the regional power balance in China’s favor. If anything, the gulf between the two countries — in terms of their perceptions, attitudes, and expectations of each other — has widened in recent years. Despite growing economic ties, there is little or nothing positive about India’s history, economy, or society in Chinese school textbooks. Official media portrays India as “a backward country full of horrific stories.” Amid reports of an Indian consumer boycott of Chinese goods, many Chinese netizens joked that they could find nothing produced by India that they could boycott. When he was vice-foreign minister, Wang Yi described India as “a tribal democracy whose long-term existence was far from a certainty.” Many Chinese analysts maintain that “India as a nation never really existed in history,” and urge Beijing to remove an emerging security threat by initiating the balkanization of India into 20-30 independent states with the aid of friendly countries. A Huanqiu commentary on July 28, 2017, warned India not to mess with China: “China has the capacity to make each of India’s northeastern states independent.” Many believe that “China and India cannot really deal with each other harmoniously” because “there cannot be two Suns in the sky.” The opinion pieces in Renmin Ribao, Xinhua, China Daily and nationalistic Global Times provide invaluable insights into Chinese elite thinking on India. Some may argue that the war-mongering rhetoric is not representative of China’s official policy and that sensational press articles represent the shrill voice of those who advocate a tougher line toward India. After all, similar commentaries have appeared against Japan, Vietnam, South Korea and the Philippines in the recent past. The most plausible explanation is that Chinese government encourages this nationalistic outpouring to pressure New Delhi to comply with its demands. It also reflects a new consensus on hardline policy toward rising India. In short, there exists in the Chinese commentariat a deep distrust and dislike of India — with the converse also holding true. “India cannot compete with China” Another dominant Chinese belief is that there is more hype than substance to India’s rise, generated mostly by the Western media. While Indians benchmark themselves against China, the Chinese see their country as not just an Asian power but a global power on par with the United States while making disparaging comments about India’s “unrealistic and unachievable big power dreams” (daguomeng). Whilst China already struts the world stage as a superpower, India remains far behind in all indices of power. Official China loathes being spoken of in the same breath as India. India plays no part in the vision projected by Beijing of the 21st century as a Chinese one — albeit except as a junior partner. Given China’s growing global footprint and the West’s current disarray, Beijing feels no need to play the anti-West, Asian solidarity card, or make any concessions to keep India on its side. Traditionally, China has long looked at India merely as an upstart wannabe that likes to punch above its weight and needs to be constantly reminded of its place. Much of Beijing’s strategic penetration deep into South Asian and the Indian Ocean has clearly been at India’s expense. What irks the Chinese elite apparently is the international praise showered on India’s democratic model. China’s economy and military are both nearly five times the size of India’s. The Chinese contend that their economic success proves the superiority of “the China model.” The PLA judges the Indian military inferior to the Chinese in combat, logistics, equipment, and war-fighting capability. Meanwhile, the potential emergence of India as an alternative pole worries Beijing. A main objective of China’s Asia policy is to prevent the rise of a rival to challenge its status as the Asia-Pacific’s sole “Middle Kingdom.” China’s strategic culture necessitates a distrust of strong, powerful neighbors and a preference for small, weak, and subordinate or client buffer states. Few, if any, of China’s strategic thinkers hold positive views of India for China’s future. India’s efforts to take counter-balancing measures are perceived as challenging and threatening in China. Much to China’s chagrin, India’s “Act East” policy and naval activism have encouraged many countries to “view India as a counterweight to China in Southeast Asia.” The Asia-Africa Growth Corridor to promote growth and connectivity proposed together by India and Japan has drawn negative media commentary for “trying to trip China’s OBOR.” Those who see India’s rise as China’s “Thucydides Trap” favor nipping it in the bud before it’s too late. Others favor leveraging mistrust and conflict in relations between India and its smaller South Asian neighbors and engaging in long-term strategic competition to sap India’s will and prevent it from spreading its wings. Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative seeks to integrate Asia’s natural resources, markets, and bases into China’s national development strategy. Moderate voices who want Beijing to accommodate a rising India in order to leverage its economic growth and partner with it to build a multipolar world are often drowned out by more hawkish voices. ((ul))Chinese leaders seem confident that China’s growing economic and military((/ul)) might ((ul))would eventually ((/ul))((ul))enable Beijing to re-establish a Sino-centric a hierarchical order((/ul)) as the United States remains disoriented and Japan shrinks economically and demographically, while India is subdued by Beijing’s “all-weather relationships” with its South Asian neighbors. For Chinese diplomats and strategists, some resistance (“frictions” or “nuisances” from pesky neighbors, as Global Times put it) in China’s march toward glory and greatness is to be expected, but resistance will eventually give way to accommodation followed by reconciliation on China’s terms. As such, the goal is to convince neighboring countries that the overall balance of power has shifted in Beijing’s favor, and their long-term interests lie in cutting bilateral deals with China. The kowtowing of Filipino, Thai, Cambodian and Malaysian leaders vindicates this approach. Chinese officials openly talk of buying off smaller countries instead of invading them. Strategically-located countries with resources, markets and naval bases are usually the largest recipients of Chinese largesse. Whether imperial, nationalist or communist, the aim of Chinese policy has been that neighbors must be respectful, obedient, and in areas immediately adjacent to the Chinese lands, preferably impotent and sufficiently weak. Overawed by China’s growing wealth and power, India and other Chinese neighbors are expected to acquiesce to China’s primacy and accept Beijing as their “benevolent big brother.” Those who seek to contain China by banding together or aligning with the United States and allies would invariably incur Beijing’s wrath. The policy of using territorial disputes to seek subservience creates contradictions that lead Beijing to support the 1890 Qing-British Treaty that demarcated borders with Sikkim and Tibet but to oppose the 1914 Simla Convention, to uphold the watershed principle on the Sikkim boundary demarcation but oppose it on the China-India border in Arunachal Pradesh. Xi’s Dream: China as Number One Last but not least, China has always seen itself as a superior, unrivaled civilization-state. The CCP leadership consciously conducts itself as the heir to China’s imperial legacy, often employing the symbolism and rhetoric of empire. From primary school textbooks to television historical dramas, the state-controlled media has force-fed generations of Chinese a diet of nationalist bluster and imperial China’s grandeur. One lesson Chinese school textbooks teach is that “strength leads to expansion and weakness to contraction.” That is why Beijing no longer feels constrained by bilateral or multilateral pacts or treaties that it signed on to “when China was weak.” A common refrain is that “other countries need to ‘get used to’ its assertive posture and Chinese maritime forays, whether they like it or not.” So “history” battles over territorial disputes are essentially about the future of regional order: Pax Sinica versus Pax Americana. Beijing’s assessment of the United States as being distracted internally, and weakened diplomatically, has emboldened Chinese leadership to be aggressive. In the past six months alone, Beijing has threatened war with Vietnam, the Philippines, and India. As Martin Jacques puts it: “Imperial Sino-centrism shapes and underpins modern Chinese nationalism.” The CCP’s version of history — a benign and benevolent China at the center of Asia — commanding obeisance from less civilized is imagined, self-serving version, and constructed to serve the Party’s domestic legitimacy and foreign policy goals. Hyper-nationalism, a belief in Han exceptionalism, and of the inevitability of a post-American Sino-centric world now shape Beijing’s India policy. Chinese leaders are cautious but also known risk-takers. And the PLA’s proclivity to tolerate risk on the border with India is much greater. As in the late 1950s, rising India is once again being viewed by PLA generals as an ambitious power with whom China may have to have a day of reckoning. Chinese strategic thinkers feel that a limited war with India would send a resounding message to those who are again courting and counting on India as a balancer or counterweight to China in the 21st century. The demonstrative effect of a short and swift victory over India would buttress the need for other Asian countries to accommodate China’s growing power by aligning with, rather than against China. Instead of challenging China, Indian leaders will then be much more deferential. Even more tantalizing is the prospect of several weak and warring states in South Asia — all vying for Chinese aid and support.

Supply growth results in declining prices. The decline in prices signals that the market is saturated and production must slow down.

Therefore, ((/ul))((ul))creativity and creation((/ul))((ul)) are the key to solving the problem of growth((/ul)). However, creativity, or what we call entrepreneurship when we talk about economy, is not a science. We cannot use it in any predictable way. It is a very uncertain and contingent factor that is fraught with many unknowns and surprises. Therefore, the problem of economic growth is reformulated into the problem of how to make innovation constant, predictable, and steady, rather than sporadic and contingent. In other words, how can we control our creativity? As has already been pointed out, consumption acts as a constraint on production. Production appreciates and consumption depreciates. The tendency of consumption to depreciate our economy is the reason for the existence of limits to rates of economic growth. As one can see, production and consumption are two most essential economic functions. They are mutually dependent, complementary and cannot exist without each other. The problem for achieving constant and sustained growth is that their vectors point in different directions: one toward appreciation and the other toward depreciation. However, do they have to be opposed to each other? There are two kinds of consumption that we know. One kind of consumption is consumption of final products. Indeed, this kind of consumption always depreciates products. You drive your new car out of the parking lot and it immediately loses value. But this form of consumption is not the only one we know. There is also a form of consumption that appreciates products, for example, consumption of raw materials or semi-finished products. Another interesting case of consumption that appreciates is the consumption of technological devices and machines. Indeed, physical use of such devices and machines depreciates them. However, they also represent certain technological knowledge. Knowledge consumption involves our mind. Mental consumption inevitably involves mediation and, therefore, construction that takes place in our mind. In other words, in order to consume something our mind has to create forms of mediation that allow us to consume this something, or, in other words, we have to produce it in our mind. Our sense organs transmit to our brain electrical signals that the brain interprets. We produce reality and production necessarily involves appreciation. Thus mental consumption involves necessarily the creation of new knowledge and hence appreciation. The above argument bears one important conclusion that consumption does not necessarily involve depreciation. Consumption can also, like production, be associated with appreciation, particularly consumption that involves mental activity that is associated with production of knowledge, or creation. ((ul))((hl))We live in the era of ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))knowledge society((/hl))((/ul)) ((ul))when ((/ul))((ul))((hl))knowledge is the main means of production((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) and the ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))principal product((/hl))((/ul)).

((ul))They do not stand opposed to each other and ((/ul))((ul))((hl))t((/hl))((/ul))((ul))heir balance does not slow down the economy but is the ((/ul))((ul))source of its appreciation and constant growth((/ul)).

In other words, how can we control our creativity? As has already been pointed out, consumption acts as a constraint on production. Production appreciates and consumption depreciates. The tendency of consumption to depreciate our economy is the reason for the existence of limits to rates of economic growth. As one can see, production and consumption are two most essential economic functions. They are mutually dependent, complementary and cannot exist without each other. The problem for achieving constant and sustained growth is that their vectors point in different directions: one toward appreciation and the other toward depreciation. However, do they have to be opposed to each other? There are two kinds of consumption that we know. One kind of consumption is consumption of final products. Indeed, this kind of consumption always depreciates products. You drive your new car out of the parking lot and it immediately loses value. But this form of consumption is not the only one we know. There is also a form of consumption that appreciates products, for example, consumption of raw materials or semi-finished products. Another interesting case of consumption that appreciates is the consumption of technological devices and machines. Indeed, physical use of such devices and machines depreciates them. However, they also represent certain technological knowledge. Knowledge consumption involves our mind. Mental consumption inevitably involves mediation and, therefore, construction that takes place in our mind. In other words, in order to consume something our mind has to create forms of mediation that allow us to consume this something, or, in other words, we have to produce it in our mind. Our sense organs transmit to our brain electrical signals that the brain interprets. We produce reality and production necessarily involves appreciation. Thus mental consumption involves necessarily the creation of new knowledge and hence appreciation. The above argument bears one important conclusion that consumption does not necessarily involve depreciation. Consumption can also, like production, be associated with appreciation, particularly consumption that involves mental activity that is associated with production of knowledge, or creation. ((ul))((hl))We live in the era of ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))knowledge society((/hl))((/ul)) ((ul))when ((/ul))((ul))((hl))knowledge is the main means of production((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) and the ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))principal product((/hl))((/ul)). ((ul))The share of knowledge production by comparison with the production of consumer goods is constantly ((/ul))((ul))growing((/ul))((ul)) and already begins to ((/ul))((ul))outstrip((/ul))((ul)) the latter((/ul)). ((ul))Since consumption of knowledge, just like its production, is associated with appreciation, the transition to knowledge society suggests that in the modern economy ((/ul))((ul))((hl))both consumption and production will lead to appreciation and increase in wealth((/hl))((/ul)). ((ul))They do not stand opposed to each other and ((/ul))((ul))((hl))t((/hl))((/ul))((ul))heir balance does not slow down the economy but is the ((/ul))((ul))source of its appreciation and constant growth((/ul)). Balance in this case means that when production grows, so does consumption and both contribute to appreciation of the economy and economic growth. ((ul))The ((/ul))((ul))((hl))constraint((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))on((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))rates of growth disappears and the pace of economic growth can ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))accelerate((/hl))((/ul)). The combined effect of growth that comes from production and consumption is double from what it is in our current economy. In other words, ((ul))((hl))economic growth becomes ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))exponential and limitless((/hl))((/ul))((ul)): as production increases, so does consumption, and more consumption leads to greater appreciation and greater wealth. This infinite and exponential economic growth is not only possible, but is, in fact, ((/ul))((ul))essential((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) ((ul))((hl))Without such growth our civilization simply ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))cannot exist((/hl))((/ul)). ((ul))Our civilization is((/ul)) essentially ((ul))a dissipative system that constantly generates ((/ul))((ul))entropy((/ul)). ((ul))((hl))As soon as this system ceases to create new levels and forms of organization, it begins to ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))deplete available resources((/hl))((/ul)).

Panel I ((ul))The((/ul))((ul)) first panel discussion, on “Mobilizing political momentum for ambitious actions on mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation((/ul))”, comprised two segments, the first of which was moderated by Achim Steiner, Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), ((ul))who said people around the world were listening for ((/ul))((ul))signs of hope((/ul))((ul)) and action from the ((/ul))((ul))deliberations((/ul)). Ahmed Djoghlaf, co-chair of the Ad-hoc Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action, also speaking for his colleague, Daniel Reifsnyder, said a new and ambitious strategy to win the climate war depended on the collective will and action of the international community. “((ul))The clock is ((/ul))((ul))ticking((/ul))((ul)) and time is of essence((/ul)),” he said, ((ul))calling for productive use of the weeks before the ((/ul))((ul))Paris conference((/ul)). The panellists for the first segment were Izabella ((ul))Monica((/ul)) Vieira ((ul))Teixeira((/ul)), ((ul))Minister of Environment of ((/ul))((ul))Brazil((/ul))((ul));((/ul)) Dr. Khaled ((ul))Fahmy((/ul)), Minister for Environment ((ul))of ((/ul))((ul))Egypt((/ul)) and President of the African Ministers Conference on Environment; ((ul))Thoriq((/ul))((ul)) Ibrahim((/ul)), Minister for Environment and Energy ((ul))of Maldives((/ul)); Xie Zhenhua, Special Representative on Climate Change of China; and Miguel Arias Canete, Commissioner of the European Union in charge of Energy and Climate Change. Ms. Teixeira stressed the need for fair, inclusive and equitable agreement to enable movement towards a new paradigm for development based on a low-emissions framework. ((ul))Differentiation was a crucial element where each party could offer a fair contribution towards sustainable development((/ul)). Dr. Fahmy ((ul))said((/ul)) Africans going to Paris were not looking for a rewriting of the UNFCCC, but its operationalization in such areas as adaptation, mitigation, transfer of technology and resources. ((ul))Adaptation was an ((/ul))((ul))essential priority for Africa((/ul))((ul)),((/ul)) the cost of which could hit $100 billion a year by 2050, he said, calling for a global partnership on renewable energy development. Mr. ((ul))Ibrahim((/ul)), ((ul))stressing the vulnerabilities of small island ((/ul))((ul))developing States like Maldives((/ul)), ((ul))said ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the first step towards building political momentum was to ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))scale up action now((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)), not some time in the future((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) All countries must fulfil their commitments and establish clear benchmarks for financing, while exploring new opportunities to support action in critical sectors. Mr. Xie urged all parties to strengthen their participation based on commitments to achieving green low-carbon development, thereby bringing about a win-win situation. China had integrated green development into its national strategy and would make determined efforts to undertake its international responsibilities based on national realties and capabilities. Mr. Canete said ((ul))the immediate priority((/ul))((ul)) was to demonstrate a ((/ul))((ul))global resolve((/ul))((ul)) to ensure that Paris would be a ((/ul))((ul))turning point((/ul))((ul)) in addressing climate change.((/ul)) ((ul))Although the process may seem slow, ((/ul))((ul))demonstration((/ul))((ul)) of ((/ul))((ul))strong political will((/ul))((ul)) would help achieve results.((/ul)) The European Union believed the agreement, to be successful, should be dynamic and oriented towards the longer term. Making statements after the panel discussion were the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Marshall Islands (on behalf of the Pacific Small Island Developing States); the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iceland; the Minister for State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office of the United Kingdom; and the Minister for Environment, Spatial Planning and Energy of Portugal. The Panel’s second segment was moderated by Felipe Calderón, former President of Mexico and Chair of the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate. ((ul))The ((/ul))((ul))panellists((/ul))((ul)) were Edna ((/ul))((ul))Molewa((/ul))((ul)), Minister for Environment of ((/ul))((ul))South Africa((/ul)); Gabriel Vallejo, Minister for Environment and Sustainable Development of Colombia; ((ul))Professor Ephraim ((/ul))((ul))Kamuntu((/ul))((ul)),((/ul)) Minister for Water and Environment ((ul))of Uganda((/ul))((ul));((/ul)) Isabella Lovin, Minister in charge of International Development Cooperation of Sweden; and Trigg Talley, United States Deputy Special Envoy for Climate Change. Opening the discussion, Mr. Calderón said the next 15 years were a make-or-break period, adding that, new opportunities, if identified and implemented properly, could make the difference. Ms. Molewa ((ul))said no group was ((/ul))((ul))more interested((/ul))((ul)) in a ((/ul))((ul))rules-based regime((/ul))((ul)) than African countries.((/ul)) South Africa had embarked on an ambitious renewal energy programme, drawing investment from the private sector. ((ul))Adaptation and mitigation efforts had begun to show results in anti-poverty efforts((/ul)). South Africa was committed to achieving a fair and equitable agreement that assured adequate financing. Mr. Vallejo said Colombia was finalizing its national commitment document, which would reflect its commitments and actions, and was awaiting signals from Paris on legally binding international goals. ((ul))((hl))Such alignment of ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))national and international action((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) was the best ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))guarantor of success((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), provided they were pursued in a transparent manner with regular follow-up.

((ul))Twenty-five years have ((/ul))((ul))passed((/ul))((ul)) and, with only minor exceptions, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Congress has not updated employment-based immigration law to reflect the enormous changes in the world and the increased demand for – and economic importance of – individuals with technical skills((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul))1","The 1990 Act established two numerical limits that have contributed to what many employers today see as a dysfunctional immigration system. These limits are 1) a 140,000 annual limit on employment-based immigrant visas (also known as “green cards”) for permanent residence, including a “per country” limit, and 2) a 65,000 annual limit on H-1B temporary visas.","The two categories are complementary, since, in practice, a high-skilled foreign national almost always is first granted H-1B status before gaining permanent residence (since it can take years to gain permanent residence). An individual who receives an immigrant visa or green card obtains permanent residence, meaning he or she can remain in the United States permanently (barring the commission of a serious crime or long absences from the country). In contrast, a temporary visa, such as an H-1B, generally has a set term that does not allow an individual to stay permanently. H-1B status is typically three years, with a renewal for an additional three years, and an extension permitted when a green card application is pending more than 180 days. Increasing the number of employment-based green cards to accompany any increase in H-1B visas would help prevent larger backlogs for skilled immigrant green cards.","LIMITS ON EMPLOYMENT-BASED GREEN CARDS","((ul))While the 1990 Act increased the number of employment-based green cards, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the past 25 years has shown the new ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))annual limit was set too low((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) ((ul))((hl))The overall annual limit on employment-based immigration was increased from 54,000 to 140,000((/hl))((/ul)), although the comparison is not precise because Congress reconfigured the preference categories in the 1990 Act. ","((ul))In reality, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) legislation did not permit 140,000 new scientists and engineers to obtain permanent residence each year((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), as supporters((/ul)) of the bill might have ((ul))assumed((/ul)). ((ul))((hl))More than half of the 140,000 ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))quota((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) in a typical year is used by the dependents (spouses and children under 21) of the principals sponsored((/hl))((/ul)), about 54 percent in FY 2012.2 Only 120,000 of the 140,000 employment-based immigrant visas are reserved for the top three preferences. ((ul))Also, up to 10,000 of the third preference could be used for “Other Workers,” usually for jobs that do not require a college degree((/ul)).3 ((ul))That means typically ((/ul))((ul))((hl))no more than about 60,000 individual skilled immigrants gain permanent residence each year in America((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) – representing only about 0.02 percent of the U.S. population.((/ul))","Moreover, ((ul))the legislation retained per-country limits on employment-based immigration((/ul)). Under those limits generally no more than 7 percent of a preference category can be filled by nationals of a single country. In practice, ((ul))this provision has harmed individuals from countries with large populations, having a significant impact on immigrants from India and China((/ul)) that could not have been anticipated back in 1990. During the 1990s and in later decades, an increased number of Indian and Chinese students came to the United States to attend U.S. universities, particularly to study engineering and computer science. When recruiting on campuses, U.S. employers used H-1B visas to hire these highly skilled individuals and later sponsored many for permanent residence.","((ul))Due to the per country limits, the wait times grew longer for Indian and Chinese immigrants.

First, it seems unreasonable that St. Lucia, a country with a population of just under 200,000, should get the same maximum quota as China or India, which both have populations of over a billion people. China and India are “countries” only because of contingent geopolitical and historical factors – in reality, they are more akin to continents. Several states in India, for example, have bigger populations than the whole of France. Moreover, ((ul))China and India both exhibit remarkable linguistic and ethnic diversity – so if the idea behind the quota system is to promote diversity among the immigrant population, then assigning quotas to countries seems ham-handed((/ul)).","Second, the fact that the quotas specifically apply to country of birth renders the system further unfair and outdated. In today’s increasingly globalized world, many people spend most of their lives in countries other than the one in which they were born. Thus, in our example, Arvind may well have grown up in St. Lucia from a young age. He may even be a citizen of St. Lucia, and identify culturally with residents of the country.

Since such reform may not be imminent, the status quo with regards to the quotas is likely to remain for some time to come.","I’m sure that this delay in favor of comprehensive reform serves many political goals.

((ul))Retrenching federal entitlements has been his north star since he arrived in Congress in 1999((/ul)). ((ul))Throughout Ryan’s career((/ul)), the policy idea most often associated with him is converting Medicare into a “premium support” or voucher system. ((ul))Under((/ul)) that ((ul))approach((/ul)), ((ul))the((/ul)) federal government would no longer pay directly for seniors’ health care, as it does now, and instead would provide them a fixed sum of money to purchase private insurance. (While premium support would still allow seniors to buy into the existing Medicare system itself, most analysts believe it would quickly grow unaffordable because only those with the greatest health needs would do so.) The “Better Way” policy blueprint House Republicans issued under Ryan’s direction in 2016 endorsed premium support. But the speaker has not pushed it to a vote. In interviews last month, Ryan signaled his determination to force a 2018 debate on restructuring Medicare and other big safety-net programs. “We [must] spend more time on the health-care entitlements, because that’s really where the problem lies,” Ryan insisted. ((ul))Ryan is right that federal spending for the elderly is on an unsustainable trajectory, mostly because American society is steadily aging((/ul)). Through 2050, the Social Security trustees estimate that the number of seniors will rise from 48 million to 86 million. The Congressional Budget Office projects that, as a result, by 2047 Social Security and the major federal health-care programs, principally Medicare and Medicaid, will consume two-thirds of all federal spending (except for interest on the national debt).

((ul))The CBO projects that as spending grows on seniors, as well as on health care, federal discretionary spending—the portions of the budget that invest in future generations—will shrink relative to the economy((/ul)). That would not only be unfair to younger Americans, but it would also be counterproductive for the old: Seniors need more of today’s diverse youth population to reach the middle class so they can pay the payroll taxes that support Social Security and Medicare. And although some Democrats want to avoid any cuts to programs for the elderly while at the same time preserving discretionary spending, in a graying society that would require an increase in taxes and total federal spending to a level that Americans are highly unlikely to accept. This dilemma’s logical solution is a three-sided agreement to raise taxes, impose some constraints on retirement programs, and preserve investments in future generations. Almost all serious, bipartisan deficit-reduction proposals (such as the one from the Obama-era Simpson-Bowles commission) have offered some variation on that formula.
