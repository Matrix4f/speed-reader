((ul))((hl))The plan proposed here ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))depends crucially on strict enforcement of immigration and labor laws((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) ((ul))Because the plan essentially taxes employers who hire foreign labor by requiring that they buy a permit, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the presence of unauthorized immigrants would undermine the plan((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))-undocumented immigrants would continue to be a cheaper source of labor than natives or legal foreign workers((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) The government therefore must be able to require verification of virtually all workers' legal status in an easy, fast, low-cost, and foolproof manner. Any employer who withholds taxes for an employee--foreign or native--should be required to verify the worker's eligibility to work legally.30 Setting up an accurate electronic database and enforcing sizable penalties for employers who hire unauthorized immigrants are vital to the success of the plan."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":40}},{"tag":"Impossible to administrate an auction – it requires regular time adjustments and judgments about initial quotas","cite":"OECD, 9 - ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT (“International Migration Outlook, 2009” http://intranet.oit.org.pe/WDMS/bib/virtual/colecc_oig/pub_ocde/internac_migration_outlook[2009].pdf ","text":["While auctioning visas may indeed raise additional monetary benefits compared with posted-price selling models, the expectations of efficiency gains may be exaggerated.","The first problem is that the auction system requires identifying rules to fix the number of visas offered and/or reservation prices. In consequence, ((ul))((hl))the auction system does not contribute to ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))rationalising((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) the supply, that is, to deciding on the optimal level of migration((/hl))((/ul)). To some extent, ((ul))((hl))the auction system could indeed even complicate the problem compared with a quota system with fixed prices because it adds a time dimension((/hl))((/ul)). A well-functioning auction system would indeed need to adjust supply to the seasonal variation of labour demand from employers.","Furthermore, for an employer the real value of a work permit is based on three main elements : i) scarcity of the human resource sought; ii) duration of the contract; iii) and the expected productivity of the worker. One problem is that the latter is not independent of the type of occupation or even the characteristics of the firm. This means that employers value differently the possibility of recruiting internationally according not only to needs but also to the type of job. This system will thus be biased towards the highly skilled and higher-wage occupations. One way to circumvent this difficulty would consist in establishing sub-quotas by occupations or skill levels, but this would only complicate matters and aggravate the above-mentioned problem with regard to the adjustment of supply to demand.","((ul))The recruitment cost which the employer is willing to pay will vary with the duration of the contract.((/ul)) The longer the latter, the more the employer will be willing to pay for recruiting a foreign worker. This means that, ((ul))((hl))unless the work permit is for a fixed duration and renewal is also on sale, the auction system will fail to address short-term needs and may even act as a disincentive to invest in training in order to meet longer term needs((/hl))((/ul)). One argument sometimes mentioned to support the auction system is the fact that it could help to reduce the administrative burden for managing labour migration. In particular, it would help get rid of labour market tests and shortage occupation lists, provided that the reservation price (ie. the minimum price below which work permits are not sold) is high enough to make sure that, all else being equal, employers prefer to recruit locally rather than internationally. A posted-price selling model, based on such a reservation price would, however, have identical properties in terms of reducing administrative procedures, but it would certainly yield less money. Portability is also an issue. Employers who have bid for a work permit expect to have a worker who cannot change employer, which may contradict labour law in some countries or make the employee more vulnerable to exploitation. Solutions to this, such as giving the employer the right to resell the work permit (and therefore the worker!1) or give a buy-out option to the worker, present additional problems.","Finally, increasing visa fees may have unwanted effects, especially if the costs are borne by immigrants. For instance, higher migration costs may increase the incentive to overstay, especially for temporary or seasonal migration.","All in all, ((ul))((hl))selling work permits via an auction system would probably squeeze more money out of migration but will share the limitations of quota systems and add critical allocation problems.((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) Because of the artificial constraints (quotas, reservation prices), auctions may not bring true market efficiencies to visa allocation.((/ul)) This does not mean that labour migration visa prices could not play a more important role in the management of migration flows. It would be possible, for example, to increase costs of international recruitment above administrative costs in periods of economic slowdown and lower them during expansion periods."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":113}},{"tag":"Doesn’t solve students – even if employers are certain they’ll get the necessary employees, students can’t be certain that coming to the U.S. gets them a green card","cite":"Anderson, 05 --- executive director of the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan public policy research organization, served as executive associate commissioner for policy and planning and counselor to the commissioner at the Immigration and Naturalization Service from August 2001 to January 2003 (Nov-Dec 2005, Stuart, “International Students and U.S. Policy Choices,” http://www.nfap.com/researchactivities/articles/InEd1105.pdf, accessed on 6/20/18) ***Note --- Catheryn Cotton is director of the international office at Duke University","text":["Simplify Immigration","Second, ((ul))((hl))the((/hl))((/ul)) ((ul))((hl))U((/hl))((/ul))((hl))nited((/hl)) ((ul))((hl))S((/hl))((/ul))((hl))tates((/hl)) ((ul))((hl))should streamline the immigration process for international graduate students in science and engineering.((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) International students earned nearly 60 percent of U.S. doctorates awarded in engineering in 2002.((/ul))18 ((ul))((hl))It is in the interest of the United States to have as many of those((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) individuals as feasible ((/ul))((ul))((hl))stay and work in the private sector, perform research in our labs, or teach at U.S. universities((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul))","((ul))A key existing impediment under the current system is that a company must hire a highly skilled foreign national on a temporary visa((/ul)), normally an H-1B visa.

For many of the 2.4 million Indian nationals living in the United States, including roughly 1 million who are scientists and engineers, the fears are existential; although roughly 45 percent are naturalized citizens, hundreds of thousands still depend on impermanent visas that must be periodically renewed.

Such firms recruit foreigners with college diplomas, most of whom are Indian, to work in technical jobs. For years, big tech companies such as Microsoft and Google have pressed the government to raise the number of visas allotted, saying they can’t find enough Americans with the necessary skills. H-1B critics say there are enough Americans with technology degrees to fill all the country’s technical jobs.","In April, Trump rolled out another “America First” policy and announced changes to the program. He signed an executive order that may alter who gets the annual visas, saying he wants to ensure that only the highest-skilled, best-paid immigrant workers gain entry. Lower-skilled workers would be prevented from taking jobs from Americans, he said. Outsourcing firms, such as Infosys, expect a sharp drop in the number of visas they would receive, which would hurt Indians who possess only undergraduate degrees.","((ul))((hl))The policies and outcomes have discouraged both undergraduate and graduate students from India who would like to study science and engineering in the((/hl))((/ul)) ((ul))((hl))U((/hl))((/ul))((hl))nited ((/hl))((ul))((hl))S((/hl))((/ul))((hl))tates((/hl)), ((ul))says((/ul)) Tahmina ((ul))Watson, an immigration attorney((/ul)) in Seattle.

The United States needs a nonpartisan panel that would use \"rigorous\" data analysis in its decisions, Marshall said in an interview.","The commission plan emerged in December, when Rep. Solomon P. Ortiz (D-Tex.) included it in an immigration bill backed by the House's Hispanic and Progressive caucuses. That bill, stalled in the House, would establish a seven-member commission charged with preventing wage depression and job losses for U.S. workers. It would recommend to Congress and the president annual caps on all worker visas. Congress would have to act to prevent the limits from taking effect.","Legislation being drafted by Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) is expected to take a different tack, said a Schumer aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The panel they envision would have a stronger role in deciding immigrant-worker levels in lower-skilled occupations -- such as hotel and restaurant jobs -- than in higher-skilled ones.","The commission would issue recommendations for high-skilled worker visas and wage levels, the aide said. For lower-skilled occupations, the commission could declare \"emergencies\" when it sees an imbalance between foreign-worker supply and demand. A vote in Congress would be required for the panel's recommended immigration levels for these workers.","Employers or industries that hire lower-skilled immigrants could petition the commission for temporary waivers of visa caps, although the commission would first need to determine that it wouldn't be possible to hire U.S. workers for the jobs.","Shawn McBurney, a lobbyist with the American Hotel & Lodging Association, said resorts and hotel chains that rely on seasonal workers probably couldn't get commission approval to hire more foreign workers in a timely manner.","((ul))\"There's a lot of things a commission really can't do in real time,\"((/ul)) said McBurney, whose group lobbies for companies such as Best Western International.","((ul))((hl))Corporations((/hl))((/ul)) also ((ul))((hl))want((/hl))((/ul)) the final legislation ((ul))((hl))to ensure that a commission can't mandate flows for highly skilled((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))immigrant((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))labor((/hl))((/ul)), ((ul))said((/ul)) Lynn ((ul))Shotwell, executive director of the American Council on International Personnel((/ul)).","In 2000, after a lobbying push by technology companies, such as Microsoft, that are facing worker shortages, Congress approved lifting, for three years, the annual cap on H-1B visas for skilled temporary workers to 195,000 from 65,000.

((/ul))((ul))Take, for example, the inquiry into violence against Indigenous women and girls, and((/ul)) the flow of ((ul))refugees and asylum seekers((/ul)) coming to Canada. ((ul))One of the most sensitive issues during Canada’s 2015 federal election was the((/ul)) debate about creating an ((ul))inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women((/ul)) and girls. Harper resisted creating one, despite years of urging by Indigenous communities, the United Nations and human rights groups. ((ul))Trudeau committed to launching a national inquiry during the political campaign. ((/ul))Canadians finally believed this issue would be addressed, and ((ul))there was new hope for reconciliation.

Expectations dashed, some from Indigenous communities say they have been failed once again. In a recent cabinet shuffle, Trudeau split Bennett’s ministerial portfolio, a reflection of her performance in a hard job, but she remains lead minister for the inquiry. ((ul))Expectations remain low.((/ul)) Harper lost the 2015 election for several reasons — he’d spent a long time in power, there was a charismatic new opposition leader on the scene, and he seemed to lack patience any longer to provide the morally superior rhetoric that Canadians love.

Polished and poised, he always says the “right” thing. If Trudeau’s Canada is famous for anything ((/ul))in the world, ((ul))it is for setting a good example to other countries. Trudeau implemented his((/ul)) election ((ul))campaign promise to allow 25,000 Syrian refugees((/ul)) expedited ((ul))entry((/ul)) to Canada. And when U.S. President Donald Trump moved in January 2017 to ban travellers from targeted Muslim-majority countries((hl)), ((/hl))((ul))((hl))Trudeau sent a tweet depicting Canada as a tolerant haven, and emphasized its welcoming, open borders((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). ((/ul))Trudeau’s approach to the Syria crisis and to immigration generally is in stark contrast to the Harper government’s. ((ul))((hl))His viral tweet last year was spun into a((/hl))((/ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((ul))((hl))widespread media assertion that Canada would accept everyone((/hl))((/ul)) who came. ((ul))Perhaps this was exactly what he wanted: To showcase((/ul)) his human rights credentials and ((ul))Canada’s friendliness and compassionate attitude compared to Trump’s. However, Trudeau’s tweet created a huge problem. When thousands of Haitian asylum-seekers, afraid Trump might end their t((/ul))emporary ((ul))p((/ul))rotected ((ul))s((/ul))tatus that allows them to remain in the U.S., ((ul))illegally crossed the border into Quebec, ((/ul))((ul))the Trudeau government started singing a different tune((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) In July and August 2017, 250 people a day crossed the border, many of them Haitians. ((ul))Ministers rushed to explain there was no open invitation((/ul)): There are rules that must be adhered to, and ((ul))claiming asylum is not a free ticket into Canada((/ul)). Tent camps for the initial refugee processing have been set up along the Canada-U.S. border. And more people may come. ((ul))Canadian officials are gearing up for an influx of migrants heading north in the coming months. Cancellation of protected status for the 50,000 Haitians in the U.S. has been confirmed((/ul)) by the Trump administration, ((ul))effective July 2019.((/ul)) It’s also announced that ((ul))protected status for((/ul)) the ((ul))nearly 200,000 Salvadorians living in the U.S. won’t be renewed either. ((/ul))((ul))There’s little doubt those migrants are eyeing Canada. ((/ul))But ((ul))((hl))Canada is not prepared to accept everyone((/hl))((/ul)), despite Trudeau’s tweet. ((ul))It ushered in the 25,000 Syrians shortly after his election, but after that it was back to business as usual, regardless that the scale of need was in the millions. ((/ul))Far away from the world’s war zones, Canada has always been able to roll out the welcome mat when it wanted. That’s why closer to home((ul)), the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))asylum issue with the U.S. is causing serious concerns for the Trudeau government — ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))it exposes the difference between the nationalist self-congratulation((/hl))((/ul)) that the prime minister trades in,((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))and what Canadians are willing to accept in practice. ((/ul))((ul))Many countries aren’t so lucky((/ul)). Consider, by comparison, the refugee situation for Germany as it existed in 2015. Some days, more than 10,000 Syrian refugees arrived in Germany. Almost 20,000 arrived in one weekend, 10,000 in Munich alone. Canada has not had to cope with such numbers. What’s more, ((ul))Canada is tough on those lucky enough to arrive here. Since 2000, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))at least 16 people have died in Canada’s system of immigration detention ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))centres((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). And yet Trudeau continues to burnish his personal political image((/ul)) and to poke Canada’s greatest ally in the eye — most recently in Davos. France’s Emmanuel Macron and China’s Xi Jinping have mounted apparently successful charm offensives to advance key priorities with Trump. Not Canada’s leader. ((ul))Trudeau did not bother to meet Trump at ((/ul))the recent ((ul))Davos((/ul)) World Economic Forum ((ul))so that, he said, other leaders could have a chance. ((/ul))Some have pointed to Trudeau’s apparent charm offensive with Ivanka Trump as clever and strategic. In addition to working with the president’s daughter on issues facing women in the workplace, he attended the Canadian Broadway play, ((ul))Come ((/ul))((ul))From((/ul))((ul)) Away((/ul)), with her in March 2017. But the play itself ((ul))was about Canadian inclusiveness and support for foreigners in need, not-so-((/ul))((ul))subtly((/ul))((ul)) underscoring Trudeau’s criticism of Trump((/ul))’s public policy. Is this a winning strategy? ((ul))For Trudeau, everything seems to be about glorifying Canada, and himself by extension((/ul)). That’s not always in the best interests of Canada, but it is what Canada gets in abundance from its current prime minister. Harper, despite his private reservations about former president Barack Obama, never publicly threw shade at his fellow leader. H((ul))arper was less popular than Trudeau, but Canadians could count on him for((/ul)) one thing — ((ul))not making his personal image((/ul)) on the global stage ((ul))a top priority.

What about Canada?” ((/ul))The one country in which I have never been asked that question is, you guessed it, Canada. After all, many Canadians vividly remember the embarrassing reign of Rob Ford, the mayor of Toronto who claimed to speak for the people, fulminated against his political opponents, and was, um, caught on video smoking crack with drug dealers. Canadians also realized that ((ul))the Ford moment could come back at any time((/ul)). After all, Rob’s brother and closest political ally, ((ul))Doug((/ul)), continued to be active in the country’s politics and ((ul))was cut from the same populist cloth((/ul)). The fear that one brother could take over from the other has now been realized: Earlier this year, Doug ((ul))Ford won a crowded primary to become leader of the Progressive Conservative Party in Ontario, Canada’s most populous province.((/ul)) And at Thursday’s election, he led the party to a stunning victory, winning nearly two-thirds of the seats in Ontario’s Legislative Assembly. ((ul))The similarities between((/ul)) Doug ((ul))Ford and((/ul)) Donald ((ul))Trump are obvious((/ul)): ((ul))A rich entrepreneur((/ul)), Ford has ((ul))a long history of dubious business partners and revels in attacking political and cultural elites.((/ul)) When he was his brother’s right-hand man on Toronto’s city council, ((ul))he called critical journalists “jihadists,” told an advocate for autistic children to “go to hell,” explained why neither he nor his brother would attend Pride((/ul)) events by saying he didn’t want to see “buck-naked” men, ((ul))and complained that((/ul)) in his constituency, ((ul))there were more libraries than Tim Hortons ((/ul))(think a Canadian version of Dunkin Donuts). Ford’s run for premier has been no less populist. ((ul))He has, of course, claimed that he alone stands for the people((/ul)): “[T]his victory is for the people,” he said in typical fashion at his election night rally. ((ul))He has also sought to delegitimize anybody who disagrees with him((/ul)): Continually stressing the supposed corruption of Kathleen Wynne, then the incumbent Liberal Party premier, he promised to “follow the money” through an outside audit and implied that she may soon be going to jail. But it is ((ul))the closing argument ((/ul))in one of the key debates that ((ul))most clearly encapsulates his campaign’s distinctly Trumpian spirit:((/ul)) After 15 years of mismanagement, scandals, and waste of your hard-earned tax dollars ((ul))the liberal government is desperate to hold onto power to continue lining in the pockets of their friends and their liberal insiders((/ul)). I want to make sure that we run a government that respects the taxpayers. ((ul))You know me: I’m for the little guy. ((/ul))((ul))Ford’s upset victory is yet another sign that all those political scientists and commentators who confidently dismissed fears of a worldwide populist surge((/ul)) as alarmist back in early 2017 ((ul))have been proved depressingly wrong((/ul)). But it offers four further lessons of particular relevance far beyond the land of milk and maple. 1. ((ul))((hl))Populism is a chronic disease((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). ((/ul))It is tempting to think of populism as an acute illness: A charismatic candidate like Donald Trump comes along and seduces voters with outsize promises. Once they see that the gifts on which he campaigned don’t materialize, and become fed up with his chaos and mismanagement, they slowly grow resistant to his charms. Things finally go back to normal. As Jordan Kyle and I argued after the last Italian election, this simply isn’t what happens. On the contrary, ((ul))populists are incredibly adept at surviving in office despite disappointments; at handing the reins of power ((/ul))over ((ul))to((/ul)) political((ul)) friends or blood relatives; and at infecting the political system with populist energy even if their own movement gradually fades. ((/ul))The election in Ontario is a perfect example of this broader trend: Rob Ford was disgraced as mayor of Toronto because he literally lit up a crack pipe on camera. He eventually died. But his brother has proved capable of taking his mantle and now rules over one-third of Canada’s population. ((ul))((hl))Even when things go wrong, populism, does not implode: It just hibernates.((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))This should remind Americans that they will have to keep up the fight against Donald Trump, and all he represents, well beyond 2020. Even if he fails to win re-election, Ivanka Trump or Tom Cotton—or an authoritarian populist of a different ideological stripe altogether—could well surge in 2024 or 2028. The fight against populism is a generational war, not a temporary battle. 2((hl)). ((/hl))((ul))((hl))Populists win when the opposition is divided((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). ((/ul))Populists claim that they alone speak for the whole people. As we know from Donald Trump’s election, though, they often win large political victories without actually getting a majority of the vote. This was once again the case in Ontario: Though Ford won nearly two-thirds of the seats in Parliament, he only won a little more than 40 percent of the vote. The rest of the vote was split between the left-wing New Democratic Party, at 34 percent, the center-left Liberal Party, at 19 percent, and the far-left Green Party, at 5 percent. In other words, the far-right will rule in Ontario even though, cumulatively, the parties of the left had a much greater share of the vote. Many Canadians are blaming Ford’s victory on the “first-past-the-post” system: Like in elections for the U.K. House of Commons, or the House and Senate in the United States, each district is represented by the candidate who wins the most votes. When a number of different candidates are competing for the left’s support, this allows a right-wing candidate to win with a bare plurality of the vote. In truth, though, nearly every electoral system is vulnerable to similar vote splits. Poland, for example, has a system of proportional representation in which parties are allocated seats in parliament in proportion to their support in the general population. But to avoid an extreme splintering of the party system, Poland, like most other countries with proportional representation, also establishes a minimum threshold that smaller parties have to clear to gain parliamentary representation. Because the left was hopelessly split, this allowed the radical Law and Justice Party to take an absolute majority of seats in the Sejm in 2015 even though the party got 38 percent of the votes—an even smaller proportion than Rob Ford got. While some institutional reform might help to alleviate these problems—Lee Drutman, a senior fellow at New America, for example, makes an interesting case for the benefits of “ranked-choice voting”—((ul))the only real answer is for opponents of populism to unite when they face perilous elections((/ul)). This is why it is so reassuring that the Democrats have, so far, avoided the civil war between the far-left and the center-left that so many had predicted for this spring’s primary season. But it is also why Democrats should not be too sanguine about victory in 2020. Trump’s approval ratings hover at about 42 percent. That sounds like very good news for his opponents. But as Doug Ford has just reminded us, this level of support can, under the wrong circumstances, be more than enough for populists to win big—especially if third-party candidates swoop in to divide the opposition. 3((hl)). ((/hl))((ul))((hl))Right-wing populism is possible without racism or xenophobia((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). ((/ul))It is tempting to think of right-wing populism as synonymous with racism or xenophobia. After all, from Donald Trump in the United States to Matteo Salvini in Italy and Viktor Orbán in Hungary, most right-wing populists do spend a lot of their time fulminating against ethnic and religious minorities. But when you look at lists of the controversial statements made by either Rob or Doug Ford, racist dog whistles are, for the most part, conspicuous in their absence. In a sense, this should not come as a surprise: ((ul))Toronto’s racial makeup is now majority minority.((/ul)) And while Ontario as a whole remains much less diverse, it would have been difficult for Doug Ford to become premier of the province without making significant inroads among minority voters. In another sense, though, this goes completely against the prevailing narrative. Especially in the United States, the left continues to invest a lot of hope in the idea of the “inevitable demographic majority.” As I have argued before (and will do again), the moment when Americans who actually identify as being members of a minority group will be in the majority is much more distant than authors like Ruy Teixeira believe. Just as importantly, it is far from clear that minority voters could never vote for populist candidates: As Rob’s success in Toronto and Doug’s success in Ontario demonstrates, ((ul))populists can do very well among minorities by singing from the same old hymn book while tearing out its most racist pages. ((/ul))4. ((ul))Populists can rise very quickly.((/ul)) There’s a reason why all those people at my talks used Canada as an example of a country in which populists had not won major victories. The country is ruled by Justin Trudeau, one of the few remaining progressive leaders in the world. Until a few days ago, Liberals led Ontario for 15 years. Despite a few signs of turbulence—like the temporary surge of the Wildrose Party in Alberta—the country’s politics were remarkably placid. What a difference a few months make. ((ul))((hl))In Ontario, the Liberals have gone from dominating the political scene to being reduced to seven elected members in the provincial assembly((/hl))((/ul)). This is sure to give Trudeau nightmares: If he continues to be popular, he might well win re-election with a resounding victory in fall 2019. But if he stumbles, he could be felled by a resurgent right—and mutilated by his left competitors in the NDP. ((ul))The same holds true for many other countries as well.((/ul)) Populists are likely to do well when Sweden, another country that has long been hailed as an exception to the populist rise, votes this fall. The German political establishment still counts on the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) to fade at the next federal elections in 2021. But there is just as much of a chance that the AfD will grow stronger, making the country increasingly difficult to govern. Finally, France’s Emmanuel Macron pulled off an incredible upset in 2017.

President Donald Trump intended the budget to send a message to allies and adversaries alike that the United States will put American security and interests first. Absent from this document was any mention of the values and freedoms that have long been the foundation of U.S. foreign policy. This is a mistake. Despotic and kleptocratic governments all over the world will take this as proof that they have carte blanche to crack down on their citizens, while human rights defenders will conclude that they have been abandoned by the United States. More importantly, such sentiments threaten the global norms and alliances that have propelled American prosperity and security since the end of World War II.¶ It is too early to tell how the promotion of human rights will feature in this administration’s foreign policy. On Monday, the White House notably called on Russia to release all of the peaceful protestors detained during large anti-corruption protests over the weekend. Press Secretary Sean Spicer went further, underscoring the right of people everywhere to accountable government and to “exercise their rights without fear of retribution.” This was the first mention by the Trump administration of human rights abuses in Russia or elsewhere, and was a positive first step. However, it came on the heels of many statements and indications that the administration will put human rights on the back burner.¶ For example, the president called Abdel Fattah al-Sisi a “fantastic guy,” in spite of the Egyptian strongman’s attempts to muzzle the media, independent civil society organizations, and others who dare to speak out against his rule. Trump apparently endorsed Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s war on drugs that has been responsible for the unlawful killing of over 7,000 suspected drug dealers and users. Rumors abound that the administration is considering pulling out of the U.N. Human Rights Council, an international body that has been greatly strengthened by America’s engagement. And the White House seems to be in favor of moving forward with the sale of F-16 fighter jets to Bahrain, despite the government’s intensified clampdown on the political opposition and plan to try civilians in military courts.¶ Of course, U.S. global leadership on democracy and human rights is not merely based on what it says or does overseas. ((ul))((hl))What matters((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) more ((/ul))((ul))((hl))is the example that America sets((/hl))((/ul)). By that measure, the ((ul))((hl))Trump((/hl))((/ul)) administration ((ul))((hl))has ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))already significantly eroded U.S. credibility((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) ((ul))Why would another country listen to the United States about protecting vulnerable populations((/ul)), ((ul))given perceptions that the immigration and refugee executive order was religiously motivated((/ul))? What authority does America have standing up for besieged journalists when the president of the United States has tweeted that the news media is the “enemy of the American People?” How can U.S. diplomats press security partners to protect civilians during military operations while the White House is contemplating loosening drone strike restrictions that seek to prevent civilian casualties? ((ul))((hl))Rights-abusing countries will have a much easier time brushing away U.S. criticisms of their behavior so long as these deficiencies persist at ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))home.((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))¶((/hl))((/ul)) ((ul))Authoritarian governments((/ul)) — ((ul))weary of the United States prodding them on human rights((/ul)) and critical of what they perceive as Western meddling in their sovereign affairs — ((ul))are likely celebrating this turn of events((/ul)). The president of Turkey, Recip Tayyip ((ul))Erdogan, welcomed Trump’s election and heralded an era of greater cooperation((/ul)). Increasingly rebuked by the Obama administration for his consolidation of power and crackdown on the military and judiciary, especially after a failed coup attempt in July 2016, Erdogan has much to gain by the United States looking the other way as Turkey creeps toward authoritarianism. ((ul))Countries from Saudi Arabia to Cambodia appear less inhibited in going after political opponents, assuming that Trump’s election means that they will get a free pass on human rights ((/ul))((ul))violations.((/ul))((ul))¶((/ul)) ((ul))By no means is authoritarian retrenchment a new phenomenon((/ul)). ((ul))((hl))For the past decade((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)), governments have been dismantling democratic institutions and curtailing human rights((/hl))((/ul)). Freedom House has documented 11 straight years in which there have been more declines in political and civil liberties than gains. However, ((ul))the United States often served as a check on the worst impulses of autocrats((/ul)). ((ul))((hl))Without a champion of human right((/hl))((/ul))((ul))s in the White House, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))such regimes will likely go unchallenged((/hl))((/ul)) as they commit egregious abuses and power grabs.¶ This capitulation would have major security and economic consequences for the United States and its closest allies. In addition to the moral imperative, America has strong interests in supporting democracy and human rights abroad.¶ First, democratic countries make the best, most stable partners. Democracies are more likely to form alliances and cooperate with other democracies and less likely to get embroiled in conflict. The U.S. military understands the value of having partners that respect human rights and the rule of law, and thus invests billions a year in enhancing the professionalism of security forces overseas. Recent research has deepened our understanding of the benefits for American security of having broad and deep ties to other countries. In a statistical analysis of Muslim-majority countries’ cooperation with the United States on counterterrorism, Peter S. Henne found states that received more foreign assistance were more collaborative than those that did not. Conversely, emboldened dictators tend to pursue foreign policy agendas that are erratic and destructive for the United States and its allies. North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un’s spate of nuclear tests and missile launches and Russian President Vladimir Putin’s annexation of Crimea and incursions into eastern Ukraine are emblematic of the kind of aggressive behavior the international community has come to expect from autocratic leaders.¶ Second, contrary to the president’s assertions, the United States has benefitted immensely from the liberal world order that it helped create. From the ashes of World War II, America invested in interlocking political and economic institutions, alliances, and norms — based on universal human rights, shared values, and the rule of law — that would prevent large-scale conflict and displacement in the future and fuel Europe’s recovery from the war. The United States has been both the primary engine and beneficiary of this liberal international order. To be clear, inequality has been a terrible byproduct of this system — and too many have been left behind. But, far from being victimized by globalization, the United States has enjoyed nearly 70 years of unparalleled influence because of its investment in the promotion of democracy and human rights.¶ Finally, U.S. support for democracy and human rights matters in people’s lives. It is true that the United States has been far from perfect in championing human rights, especially where America has short-term security interests. Yet there is no other country that can substitute for the United States when it comes to fighting for universal freedoms. American presidents, members of Congress, and cabinet secretaries have personally intervened to get political prisoners released from jail, prevent genocide, and bring war criminals to justice. The solidarity expressed by U.S. political and civil leaders has provided sustenance and hope to human rights defenders in the grimmest conditions. An Egyptian activist once pulled a speech given by President Barack Obama on the vital contributions of civil society out of his pocket and said to me, “When I heard these words, I knew I wasn’t alone.”¶ ((ul))At a moment in which the forces of nationalism, authoritarianism, and hatred threaten to tear our societies apart again, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the United States needs to make sure that those((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))bravely fighting against repression((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) and injustice all around the world ((/ul))((ul))((hl))know that they have not been forgotten((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul))"],"stats":{"highlightedWords":84}},{"tag":"The rest of the international community is just as bad—its try or die to stand up and prevent a crisis","cite":"Roth 18—executive director of Human Rights Watch (Kenneth, “How to Stand Up For Human Rights in the Age of Trump,” 1/18/18, Foreign Policy, https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:KXAzRi-olAsJ:https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/01/18/how-to-stand-up-for-human-rights-in-the-age-of-trump/%20&cd=14&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us)//JLE","text":["One year ago, there seemed to be no stopping politicians around the globe who claimed to speak for “the people” but built followings by demonizing unpopular minorities, attacking human rights principles, and fueling distrust of democratic institutions. Today, a popular reaction in a broad range of countries, bolstered in some cases by political leaders with the courage to stand up for human rights, has left the fate of many of these populist agendas less certain. Where the pushback has been strong, populist advances have been limited. But where centrists have capitulated in the face of hatred and intolerance, the populists have flourished.¶ As this struggle has played out, many Western powers have become more inwardly oriented, leaving an increasingly fragmented world.

Globalization, automation, and technological change have caused economic dislocation and inequality. Fear of cultural change has swept segments of the population in Western nations as the ease of transportation and communication fuels migration from war, repression, poverty, and climate change. Societal divisions have emerged between cosmopolitan elites who welcome and benefit from many of these changes and those who feel their lives have become more precarious. Demagogues have exploited the traumatic drumbeat of terrorist attacks to fuel nativism and Islamophobia.

His hostility for Muslims and migrants is well-known, yet its odiousness has been somewhat overlooked. His cruel and discriminatory polices, like the Muslim ban, aren’t even the worst of it. In publicizing crimes allegedly committed by Latino immigrants and re-Tweeting anti-Muslim videos produced by a racist group, he’s promulgating just the sort of dehumanizing propaganda that has accompanied some of the darkest chapters in human history.

((ul))Case in point((/ul)) ((ul))is((/ul)) ((ul))the global response to the president’s((/ul)) alleged ((ul))remarks that the U.S. should no longer accept((/ul)) ((ul))immigrants from “shithole countries((/ul))” such as Haiti and various African nations — ((ul))an episode that((/ul)) ((ul))has((/ul)) once again ((ul))shown how Trump excels at((/ul)) using the bully pulpit ((ul))to bring down international condemnation on his own country((/ul)).¶ Yet, as I argue in my new book, “American Grand Strategy in the Age of Trump,” ((ul))((hl))the president’s entire first year has represented a veritable assault on American soft power((/hl))((/ul)) — one that will likely cause damage outlasting Trump’s time in office.¶ When we talk about America’s soft power, we are talking about several related things: the global perception that America is a flawed but basically admirable society; the sense that U.S. foreign policy serves not just its self-interest but the broader common well-being; the use of non-coercive tools to achieve diplomatic goals. Over the decades, the U.S. has benefited enormously from all these forms of soft power.¶ During the Cold War, for instance, humanitarian assistance to needy countries and economic initiatives such as the Marshall Plan produced international goodwill that proved a crucial tool in the competition with the Soviet Union. Similarly, America’s democratic ideals have long allowed it to appeal to populations around the world, and the attractiveness of U.S. culture and society have given Washington influence with the citizenry of allies and adversaries alike.¶ ((ul))Soft power can easily be overestimated((/ul)), of course: The country of the Bill of Rights and “all men are created equal” is also the country with a tragic history of slavery and segregation. And the effect of U.S. soft power would be far less if Washington did not possess hard-power dominance. But ((ul))on the whole,((/ul)) ((ul))soft power acts as a significant force-multiplier((/ul)), ((ul))facilitating cooperation with friends((/ul)), ((ul))providing ideological advantages((/ul)) over enemies, and generally enhancing the impact of U.S. policy.¶ ((ul))Based on his record so far, however, ((/ul))((ul))Trump appears to have little understanding of the benefits soft power can provide((/ul)). ((ul))He((/ul)) has ((ul))repeatedly talked down the power of the American example((/ul)) ((ul))by arguing that his own country is morally no better than((/ul)), say, Vladimir Putin’s ((ul))Russia((/ul)). And during his first year in office, ((ul))Trump has undermined U.S. soft power in three particular ((/ul))((ul))ways.((/ul))¶((ul)) ((/ul))First, ((ul))he has ((/ul))((ul))((hl))sought crippling budget cuts((/hl))((/ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((ul))((hl))for the institutions that the U.S. government uses to exercise((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) nonmilitary ((/ul))((ul))((hl))influence((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) overseas((/ul)). Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, described the president’s first budget submission as “not a soft-power budget.” Indeed, it included trims of nearly 30 percent for the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development, and therefore entailed drastic reductions in programs focusing on global public health, food security, women’s rights, and myriad other issues.¶ The leaders of the Republican-controlled Congress promptly deemed the budget “dead on arrival,” because it would have severely weakened U.S. diplomacy, development aid and humanitarian assistance — all of which the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph Dunford, has deemed critical to achieving a lasting defeat of the Islamic State and other foreign policy objectives. But Trump’s disdain for the State Department has still had profound effects: The president of the American Foreign Service Association warned last fall that accomplished diplomats were leaving the department in droves, taking enormous institutional knowledge with them.¶ Second, ((ul))((hl))the president has attacked((/hl))((/ul)) — head-on — ((ul))((hl))the idea that the U.S. should stand((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))for something more than its own self-interest((/hl))((/ul)). A year ago, Trump used his inaugural address to frame U.S. foreign policy as a giveaway to an ungrateful world, and to call for a more narrowly nationalistic approach to American statecraft.¶ The National Security Strategy released last month emphasized intense competition — not to preserve a liberal world order that benefits all nations who play by its rules, but on behalf of America's own economic and geopolitical interests. ¶ The president has also repeatedly derided America’s role as chief promoter of democracy and human rights, thereby undermining the ideological appeal of a nation that stands for universal values. In fact, he has undertaken policies — such as his persistent efforts to restrict immigration and exclude refugees from Muslim-majority nations — that are deemed cruel and discriminatory overseas. And, of course, he has described his foreign policy as “America First” — a label explicitly endorsing the idea that the U.S. must behave more selfishly in the world. ¶ Third, ((ul))Trump has weakened American soft power through his own behavior((/ul)). ((ul))He is hardly the only president to say loathsome things,((/ul)) ((ul))but he is unique in displaying his unattractive qualities so openly((/ul)), ((ul))so unembarrassedly, so repeatedly((/ul)). ((ul))((hl))The president’s use of racist and xenophobic appeals((/hl))((/ul)), his ((ul))((hl))disdain for democratic norms((/hl))((/ul)), his generally crass style of rhetoric and action — all these characteristics have been dragging down global respect for America since the moment he took office. The outraged global reaction to the “shithole countries” incident was sadly familiar — it mimicked the criticism the president earned through his refusal to condemn white supremacists after the violence last summer in Charlottesville, Virginia, as well as several other episodes.¶ There is no ambiguity about the effect this is having. As early as June 2017, America’s global favorability in the Pew poll of global attitudes and trends had dropped from 64 percent at the end of Barack Obama’s presidency to 49 percent under Trump. Large majorities of global respondents described the American president as “intolerant,” “arrogant” and “dangerous.” Even Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin — ambitious dictators of revisionist countries — had higher personal favorability ratings than Trump. ((ul))As Trump’s own defense secretary((/ul)), ((ul))James Mattis((/ul)), has ((ul))remarked, the U.S. needs to “get the power of inspiration back((/ul)).”¶ ((ul))That’s not going to happen as long as Trump is president((/ul)). ((ul))The real question is how long it will take American soft power to recover once he ((/ul))((ul))departs.((/ul))¶((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))The good news is that U.S. soft power has traditionally been ((/ul))((ul))quite resilient((/ul)) ((ul))— it has survived globally unpopular presidents before((/ul)). The reason for this, as the Harvard scholar Joseph Nye points out, is that over the long term U.S((ul)). soft power derives less from the image of any individual than from the broader attractiveness of America’s society((/ul)), culture and political values. The bad news, however, is that ((ul))Trump can nonetheless do damage that will not be so easy to repair((/ul)).¶ As Nicholas Burns and Ryan Crocker, two of America’s most distinguished diplomats, have noted, the brain drain affecting the State Department today will have a lasting effect on America’s ability to exert non-military power effectively, because the department is losing so many individuals with experience that takes years or even decades to develop. (The fact that applications for entry-level spots in the Foreign Service are also down will make replacing that expertise all the harder.)¶ More problematic still, ((ul))even if Trump does not succeed in making the U.S. a less tolerant, less democratic, less attractive society, he may ((/ul))((ul))affect global views of America even after he leaves office((/ul))((ul)).((/ul))¶((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))Once Trump is gone((/ul)), ((ul))most governments((/ul)) and populations around the world will probably breathe a sigh of relief. But they ((ul))won’t forget that Americans elected such an individual as its president((/ul)), and they will surely wonder what that says about the judgment and the character of the nation that has long claimed to be the “last, best hope of mankind.”¶ Most of the countries the U.S. has traditionally worked with will be eager for their relationships with the superpower to get back to normal. Yet ((ul))they will have seen what the U.S. electoral system ((/ul))((ul))is capable of producing((/ul))((ul)),((/ul)) and ((ul))so ((/ul))((ul))it will be a long time before the world ever looks at America quite the same way again.((/ul))"],"stats":{"highlightedWords":59}},{"tag":"Policy inconsistency and twitter rants are an alt cause—instigates confusion and lack of trust amongst the public","cite":"Nye 17—Professor at and former dean of Harvard University's John F.

He also has some advice for US allies on how to deal with Trump.¶ DW: In our last interview before the election this past summer you said that Donald ((ul))((hl))Trump has no foreign policy, he has attitudes((/hl))((/ul)). Has what you have seen and heard since then from President-elect Trump changed that assessment?¶ Joseph Nye: Only somewhat. He has now been asked questions and had to answer some. ((ul))He also made some nominations((/ul)) for appointments, which can give you some more specificity. ((ul))But((/ul)), by and large, ((ul))((hl))many of his policies are still very vague((/hl))((/ul)). For example ((ul))on climate change: In the election campaign he was a skeptic, but in an answer in a \"New York Times\" interview after the election he said maybe there is something in it((/ul)), and yet he has appointed to the EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] a person who is a skeptic. So it is hard to know whether that attitude has changed into a policy.¶ We have to wait and see how the appointment works out and how the EPA will interact for example with the State Department, where the nominee Rex Tillerson worked for an oil company as the CEO of ExxonMobil, but said there was something to the human role in climate change. So that is just an example of an area where we know Trump's attitude and there has been a little bit more specificity as a result of answers to questions and appointments and nominations. But we still don't know what the policy will be. And that is true of a lot of areas.¶ If one would try to translate Donald Trump's ((ul))remarks((/ul)) and his cabinet selections into a very basic geopolitical outlook what emerges is that he essentially wants to be friends with Russia and be tougher on China. Do you agree with that assessment and if so is that necessarily wrong?¶ He has indeed expressed attitudes along those lines of having better relations with Russia and being tougher on China. Again a lot will depend on what that means. If, for example, better relations with Russia means that he maintains the sanctions because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine but tries to work in a business-like manner with Russia on, let's say, the Middle East or proliferation issues, than that's healthy. If on the other hand he gives up the common Western position on Ukraine, I think that's unhealthy.¶ Regarding China: If being tougher on China means that he will press on some trade issues or reciprocity in the way American companies are treated in China compared to how Chinese companies are treated in the US, that can be healthy. If on the other hand he tries to impose large tariffs on China - which he suggested during the campaign - that could lead to a trade war, which would have a tit-for-tat effect. Both sides would be worse off.¶ You also said in our earlier interview that the political discourse in the US last year during the election could hurt the attractiveness of the country internationally. How would you describe the effect the election of Donald Trump, and what has happened since, has had so far on America's global image and credibility?¶ I still believe that ((ul))((hl))the US has lost soft power as a result of ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))the campaign((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))and the ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))quality of the discourse((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) in politics((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).((/hl)) And I think that continues when you look at the way ((ul))((hl))Trump has continued to use Twitter((/hl))((/ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((ul))((hl))for provocative statements((/hl))((/ul)) ((ul))designed to manipulate the press.((/ul)) Many of these don't create attraction or admiration for the US. On the other hand the fact remains that despite the political differences, which are quite considerable, ((ul))the US is a stable society which has a transition of power by ballots not bullets((/ul)). I think ((ul))that has some effect of enhancing American attractiveness((/ul)). But, ((ul))by and large((/ul)), I think ((ul))the poor quality of the discourse has probably hurt American soft power. ((/ul))((ul))¶((/ul)) Since you mentioned Twitter, what then do you make of President-elect Trump's unprecedented Twitter diplomacy?¶ It is clearly not what was considered presidential behavior in the past. It's true that presidents like Obama have used Twitter, but they really have been staff-led expositions of policy positions. Trump manages part of his Twitter account by himself, and it often leads to angry and provocative statements which are designed to appeal to the public over the heads of the press, and thereby manipulating the press. So it's a different use of social media, and particularly Twitter, than we have seen in the past, and it looks like it will continue into his presidency.¶ Do you think this is, or should be, sustainable as he becomes President Trump?¶ I think President Trump was an unconventional candidate in the way he used Twitter and the media more generally. And I suspect he is continuing to be an unconventional president in the way he governs. If you look at the fact that his recent press conference was the first in six months, that is unusual. If you look at his constant use of Twitter in a personal capacity, that is unusual. And I think we should expect the unconventional nature of the campaign to continue into the presidency.¶ Some people have expressed concerns that his tendency to tweet often and quick could perhaps lead to international conflicts or crises. What's your view?¶ I think it will make some things more difficult to manage, because ((ul))it is very hard to express nuclear policy in 140 characters((/ul)). On the other hand, while it will create difficulties of interpretation for the State Department and for foreign ministries, I don't think it will necessarily lead to crises per se.¶ Finally, many traditional partners of the United States in Europe, like Germany, are deeply worried about the new Trump administration and somewhat puzzled about how to deal with it. What would your advice be?¶ I think patience as we try to understand a new phenomenon. For NATO partners and for Japan I would notice the administration in waiting, the Trump nominees and appointees, have been trying to express to allies the fact that the rhetoric in the campaign about withdrawing from alliances is not likely; and also that the maintenance of the systems of international alliances that has been central to the international order since 1945 is likely to continue.¶ ((ul))But what will it really means in practice and detail? ((/ul))((ul))The answer is: We don't know((/ul)). And at that point I ((ul))think the key is not to overreact,((/ul)) ((ul))to use a certain amount of patience and to respond on ((/ul))((ul))particular interests((/ul)), if it is clear what those interests are."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":53}},{"tag":"Trump is already posturing on human rights which thumps the link, but concrete policy action solves ((ul))legitimate((/ul)) and ((ul))positive((/ul)) human rights promotion","cite":"Fontaine & Bellinger 18—John B.

((ul))Trump expressed strong support for Iranians ((/ul))((ul))protesting against((/ul))((ul)) their autocratic regime((/ul)). ((ul))He added that the United States would be “watching very closely for human rights violations((/ul))!” The president’s pronouncements have been valuable in emphasizing the importance of human rights in Iran. ((ul))They also mark something of a departure for an administration that has only episodically expressed concern for((/ul)) the protect((hl))i((/hl))on of fundamental ((ul))freedoms abroad. ((/ul))Given the president’s recent focus on human rights, ((ul))((hl))it’s disappointing that the administration’s National Security Strategy((/hl))((/ul))((hl)),((/hl)) which was released on December 18, ((ul))((hl))gives human rights such short shrift((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).((/hl)) The NSS emphasizes many familiar Republican foreign policy themes, like the need to deal with China and Russia, confront North Korea and Iran, protect against terrorism and increase military strength—and for those supportive of U.S. global leadership, there is much to like. But ((ul))the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))omission of any mention of promoting human rights as a national security priority is striking,((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) and unfortunate.((/ul)) The human rights effort has long been a priority in Republican as well as Democratic administrations. Done right, ((ul))supporting human rights strengthens((/ul)), rather than weakens, ((ul))American national security((/ul)). The National Security Strategy is not wholly silent on issues like freedom and democracy. Indeed, a small portion of the document commits the administration to support individual dignity, freedom, and the rule of law. Such good things, however, are cast as “American values,” rather than rights to which all people are entitled. The strategy does make several references to “individual rights” but the term “human rights” appears just once to warn that the United States will deny admission to “human rights abusers.” Yet acknowledging the existence of universal human rights, and America’s critical role in protecting and promoting them, is more important today than in many years. In its latest 2017 report, Freedom House observed the eleventh consecutive year of decline in global freedom. Sixty-seven countries suffered net declines in civil liberties and political rights, against just thirty-six that posted gains. And the human rights situation has deteriorated not only in the usual dictatorships but also among friends and allies like Turkey, Ethiopia, Hungary, Bahrain and Azerbaijan. Where the NSS does reference a U.S. role in expanding democracy and freedom, it is largely one of inspiration rather than active promotion. This is America as city on a hill, a shining beacon but little more. “We are not going to impose our values on others,” the document assures readers. “The American way of life cannot be imposed upon others, nor is it the inevitable culmination of progress.” It precisely because such freedoms are not inevitable that America must play an active role in protecting and advancing them. This requires their vigorous promotion—the ((ul))United States as actor as well as exemplar((/ul)). Embracing the cause of basic rights and freedoms gives purpose and direction to America’s role in the world, beyond its narrowly-construed national interests. And it is consonant with precisely those American values that the National Security Strategy is at pains to highlight. ((ul))((hl))Standing up for fundamental rights((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) abroad does something more: It ((/ul))((ul))((hl))makes the world safer for Americans ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))and makes us stronger((/ul)). The NSS acknowledges this implicitly, noting, “((ul))Governments that respect the rights of their citizens remain the best vehicle for prosperity, human happiness, and peace.((/ul))” Given Trump’s repeated emphasis on the importance of national strength and restoring international respect for the United States, his administration should recognize that ((ul))((hl))America is respected((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) around the world not merely for its military might and strong economy but equally ((/ul))((ul))((hl))for its commitment to human rights((/hl))((/ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((ul))((hl))and the rule of law((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). ((/ul))As the Trump administration begins to implement its new strategy, there are three reasons why it should embrace, rather than reject, a human rights agenda. ((ul))((hl))First is to resist growing restrictions on freedom in the world((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).((/hl)) U.S. leadership is necessary to reverse this trend. ((ul))Human rights will never represent the America’s only foreign policy objective and often will not be the top agenda item((/ul)) in key foreign relationships. ((ul))But ((/ul))((ul))((hl))efforts to promote human rights should be interwoven with all else we seek to achieve((/hl))((/ul)). The decline in freedom will very likely accelerate the longer America is out of the game. ((ul))((hl))Second is the general disillusionment with human rights and democracy promotion((/hl))((/ul)) at home and abroad. ((ul))Disasters in Iraq and Libya, the Arab Spring’s failures, China’s combination of power and repression, and backsliding in places like Myanmar have all increased doubts about both liberalism’s staying power and America’s ability to aid it((/ul)). There have been deep disappointments but great successes as well, and Washington should examine the drivers of that distinction and act on the lessons. ((ul))The third reason is about us.((/ul)) The NSS argues that “America First” means more than safeguarding our security and prosperity at the expense of any others. ((ul))But the world((/ul))—and many Americans((ul))—genuinely wonder about the Trump administration’s lack of international altruism((/ul)). A ((ul))fulsome embrace of human rights would demonstrate to all the country’s nobility((/ul)) of purpose at a time ((ul))when confidence in the United States is shaky. ((/ul))All this would require a shift of presidential emphasis and philosophy. We must hope that the president’s support for freedom in Iran reflects a new recognition of the role that the United States—and the president himself—play in championing human rights around the world.

Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, has created a firestorm on Capitol Hill over revelations ((ul))((hl))the Obama administration is considering sidestepping Congress to grant illegal immigrants “amnesty” by executive fiat.((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))“Once again, ((ul))the Obama administration says one thing and does another((/ul)),” ((ul))asserts a statement from the Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee((/ul)) attributed to ranking member Lamar Smith, R-Texas. “((ul))The President has promised border security and immigration enforcement((/ul)). He has said we must hold individuals accountable for their illegal acts. And, in suing the State of Arizona, the administration argued that it is their responsibility to enforce the laws. “But now we find out the truth,” the statement continues. “((ul))While saying one thing to the public, the Obama administration is scheming to ensure that immigration laws are not enforced!” ((/ul))The fiery words come in response to an undated memo addressed to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Alejandro Mayorkas and written by four agency staffers. ((ul))The memo outlines a plan of granting illegal immigrants “deferred action” on prosecution, enabling them to live in the U.S. “indefinitely((/ul)).” While not technically granting citizenship, the deferred-action plan outlined in the memo does state such immigrants may apply for employment authorization and continue to live in the U.S. free from the threat of removal. The memo also admits the strategy could be used “as ((ul))a non-legislative version of ‘amnesty((/ul)).’” Agency spokesperson Chris Bentley has defended the Obama administration, saying the memo was nothing more than “deliberation” and an “exchange of ideas.” “As a matter of good government, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services will discuss just about every issue that comes within the purview of the immigration system,” Bentley said in an e-mail statement reported by The Washington Times. “We continue to maintain that comprehensive bipartisan legislation, coupled with smart, effective enforcement, is the only solution to our nation’s immigration challenges.” Bentley said ((ul))the Homeland Security Department “will not grant deferred action or humanitarian parole to the nation’s entire illegal-immigrant population.” ((/ul))Indeed, the authors of the memo point out problems with using their plan to grant amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants. “((ul))While it is theoretically possible to grant deferred action to an unrestricted number of unlawfully present individuals((/ul)), ((ul))((hl))doing so would((/hl))((/ul)) likely ((ul))((hl))be controversial, not to mention expensive((/hl))((/ul)),” the memo states. “Rather than making deferred action widely available to hundreds of thousands as a non-legislative version of ‘amnesty,’ (Citizenship and Immigration) could tailor the use of this discretionary option for particular groups.” The memo then lists examples of those who could benefit from deferred action, such as students under the DREAM Act, a piece of legislation proposed by Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Richard Durbin, D-Ill., that would provide a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants who attend U.S. colleges or serve in the military. But just because the report warns against using “deferred action” as a blanket amnesty for illegals doesn’t mean the Obama administration won’t try it, warn Republicans. “This memo gives credence to our concerns that the administration will go to great lengths to circumvent Congress and unilaterally execute a backdoor amnesty plan,” Sen. Grassley said, as quoted in the Times. “((ul))How to deal with the millions of illegal immigrants in the country is a question for the people’s representatives in Congress and not for unaccountable federal bureaucrats((/ul)),” blasted Smith in the GOP committee statement. “((ul))This is an insult to millions of unemployed citizens and legal immigrants who have to compete with illegal immigrants for scarce((/ul)) ((ul))jobs((/ul)). The Obama administration needs to stop its scheming and put Americans’ interests first.” Earlier this year, when news of the memo was first being whispered about in Washington, Mayorkas appeared before the Senate’s Judiciary Committee, where Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, warned the administration official against the deferred-action plan. “((ul))I think it would be a mistake for the administration to use administrative action((/ul)), ((ul))like deferred action((/ul)) on a categorical basis, to deal with a large number of people who are here without proper legal documents to regularize their status without Congress’ participation,” Cornyn said. ((ul))“The American public’s confidence in the federal government’s ability and commitment to enforce our immigration laws is at an all-time low((/ul)),” Cornyn said in a statement.

This first became apparent when Sen. Charles Grassley (R-IA) released a draft memo prepared for the director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) outlining ways the existing law could be interpreted to provide “alternatives to comprehensive immigration reform.” The immigration bureaucrats pondered “administrative relief options” to “reduce the threat of removal for certain individuals present in the United States without authorization” — that is, ((ul))to implement an amnesty for illegal immigrants without Congress ((/ul))((ul))actually enacting((/ul))((ul)) one. ((/ul))Now TAS has obtained an early draft of a memo prepared in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), a version of which sources say made it all the way up to Secretary Janet Napolitano, ((ul))contemplating a “bold” program “using administrative measures to sidestep the current state of Congressional gridlock and inertia.”((/ul)) Translation: ((ul))an amnesty for people — described as “the current unauthorized population or selected subsets”((/ul)) ((ul))— Congress has repeatedly decided not to grant amnesty. ((/ul))Maybe that amnesty would affect “the entire potential legalization population” with the exception of “individuals who pose a security risk.” Maybe it would be “narrowly tailored” and extend only to “individuals eligible for relief under the DREAM Act, AgJOBS, or other specifically defined subcategories.” For English, press 1: that means illegal immigrants who would have benefited from mini-amnesty legislation that Congress has also pointedly declined to pass. The two drafts are very similar in substance. ((ul))((hl))They both propose expanding the use of deferred action, ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))parole in place((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)), and other acts of administrative discretion for hardship cases to a much broader number of illegal immigrants((/hl))((/ul))((hl)). ((/hl))((ul))((hl))That would allow these immigrants to remain in the country indefinitely even if no legislation changing their status ever reaches the president’s desk((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) The DHS memo gets a little deeper into the weeds of U.S. immigration law and features a more interesting discussion of the political ramifications for such actions. Its authors fret that Congress might come in and undo their handiwork. “Registration would have to be completed quickly, in order to reduce incentives for individuals to enter the U.S. unlawfully in the hope of applying for the program,” the document reads. “To create an operationally feasible application program, DHS would require up-front funding and sufficient time to a ramp-up and the need for upfront funding may provide Congress an opportunity to block this initiative if it objects.” Even worse, from the bureaucrats’ perspective, ((ul))Congress could react to the idea by reining them in even further: legislation could advance on Capitol Hill to “bar or greatly trim back” DHS’s discretion((/ul)) in deferred action and humanitarian parole even more than it is already limited by current law. Amnesty supporters on the Hill may bail: “((ul))Even many who have supported a legislated legalization program may question the legitimacy of trying to accomplish the same end via administrative action, particularly after five years in which the two parties have treated this as a matter to be decided by Congress((/ul)).” The voters might be even peskier than Congress: ((ul))“The Secretary would face criticism that she is abdicating her charge to enforce the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))immigration laws((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).”((/ul)) People who have dedicated their careers to enforcing those laws might also cause annoying problems: “((ul))Internal complaints of this type from career DHS officers are likely and ((/ul))((ul))((hl))may also be used in the press to bolster the criticism.((/hl))((/ul))((ul))”((/ul)) Finally: ((ul))“((/ul))((ul))((hl))Opponents of the registration program will characterize it as ‘amnesty’” and complain that it is “being proposed to pander to Latino voters.”((/hl))((/ul))"],"stats":{"highlightedWords":87}},{"tag":"Perm do both – CP is neither textually nor functionally exclusive with the aff\nCP doesn’t solve tech leadership for 4 reasons:\nDomestic military funding has never worked in the past and a new policy won’t change that – take Trump’s increase in military as an example\nChina is currently STEALING US military and tech power – that’s our Sheng 1AC ev.

((ul))For one thing, much of this spending has had and will have little or nothing to do with ((/ul))((ul))actually defending((/ul))((ul)) the United States or its allies, and most of it isn’t necessary for that purpose((/ul)). The U.S. spends this much on a military this large in order to police and attack other parts of the world, and the only reason to increase that spending for an even larger military is to do more of those things. We should call it military spending or hegemony spending or imperial spending, but we should stop the bad habit of referring to it as spending on defense. There is no security threat comparable to the Soviet Union today that would begin to justify spending more than at the height of the Reagan build-up. Reagan’s splurging on the military was also excessive, but he could at least point to a major rival that posed a serious threat as the reason for doing it. ((ul))Threats to the U.S. today are not remotely on the same scale and don’t require anything like the same outlays on the military.

Adams notes that the surge in military spending is happening only because the military is demanding it and our representatives and president have no interest in rejecting that demand: It’s worth thinking about why defense spending is about to explode. It’s not because of some revolutionary change in the global security environment — aside from those pesky North Koreans and their nukes, America has never been so secure. It’s not because the U.S. military’s effectiveness has declined; it remains the most powerful force in the world, highly capable and very ready. The reason the Pentagon’s budget is now on a long-term upswing is because the military has spent years loudly lobbying for such an increase while complaining about an alleged “readiness crisis.”The reason the Pentagon’s budget is now on a long-term upswing is because the military has spent years loudly lobbying for such an increase while complaining about an alleged “readiness crisis.” Complaining works, at least when the military does it, because politicians in both parties fear the military’s wrath. Politicians are desperate to be seen as “strong” on military spending. Most fear that it will be used against them at the next election if they don’t vote for every increase, and so most of them supporting throwing more money at the Pentagon regardless of circumstances or need. Especially since most members of Congress won’t oppose the endless wars that the U.S. is fighting, they certainly aren’t going to oppose spending more on the military while those wars are going on, and so Congress’ most powerful tool for oversight and influence is never used effectively because most representatives and senators are afraid to use it. Congress’ abdication of its responsibilities in matters of war guarantees that it is useless in reining in excessive military spending. ((ul))Insofar as more than sixteen years of endless war have put too much strain on the military, the solution is ((/ul))((ul))not((/ul))((ul)) to provide more money so that the U.S. can continue waging failed and unnecessary wars((/ul)). The right way to repair any damage that has been done is to stop wasting military resources on pointless wars of choice that have nothing to do with securing the U.S. Until the public and our representatives demand an end to perpetual war, we should expect the military budget to keep increasing indefinitely.

It would also mandate science agencies collect, analyze and report data on the effectiveness of research and development grants to universities and federal laboratories. Lawmakers also approved the Women in Aerospace Education Act, which would help bring more women into fellowship programs at NASA and national laboratories, and the Supporting Veterans in STEM Careers Act, which aims to open up more opportunities for veterans to pursue jobs in STEM.

The talent gap is particularly stark in relation to age and gender. In September 2017, men held more than 72 percent of government IT positions, according to data from the Office of Personnel Management. At the same time, federal agencies also employed roughly 4.5 IT specialists age 60 and over for every one employee under the age of 30.

(According to the Energy Information Agency of the US Department of Energy, total CO2 emissions in China were 8.38 billion metric tonnes in 2011, with 6.95 billion tons from coal burning, nearly all of which is used electrical power generation.)

(Under reservoir conditions, one billion tons of CO2 occupies a volume of ∼1.3 billion cubic meters, equivalent to 8.18 billion barrels. Thus, 3.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide would correspond to a volume of approximately 28.6 billion barrels. There are currently ∼850,000 wells producing oil around the world.)

Before embarking on projects to inject enormous volumes of CO2 at numerous sites around the world, it is important to note that over time periods of just a few decades, ((ul))((hl))modern seismic networks have shown that earthquakes occur nearly ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))everywhere((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) in continental interiors((/hl))((/ul)). Fig. 1, Upper shows instrumentally recorded earthquakes in the central and eastern United States and southeastern Canada. Fig. 1, Lower shows instrumentally recorded intraplate earthquakes in south and east Asia (4). The seismicity catalogs are complete to magnitude (M) 3. The occurrence of these ((ul))earthquakes mean((/ul))s ((ul))that nearly everywhere in continental interiors((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))a subset of the preexisting faults in((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))the crust is potentially active in the current((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))stress field((/ul)) (5, 6). This is sometimes referred to as the critically stressed nature of the brittle crust (7). It should also be noted that despite the overall low rate of earthquake occurrence in continental interiors, some of the most devastating earthquakes in history occurred in these regions. In eastern China, the M 7.8, 1976 Tangshan earthquake, approximately 200 km east of Beijing, killed several hundred thousand people. In the central United States, three M 7+ earthquakes in 1811 and 1812 occurred in the New Madrid seismic zone in southeast Missouri. ((ul))((hl))Because of the critically stressed nature of the crust, ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))fluid injection in deep wells can trigger earthquakes when the injection increases pore pressure in the vicinity of preexisting potentially active faults((/hl))((/ul)). The increased pore pressure reduces the frictional resistance to fault slip, allowing elastic energy already stored in the surrounding rocks to be released in earthquakes that would occur someday as the result of natural geologic processes (8). This effect was first documented in the 1960s in Denver, Colorado when injection into a 3-km-deep well at the nearby Rocky Mountain Arsenal triggered earthquakes (9). Soon thereafter it was shown experimentally (10) at the Rangely oil field in western Colorado that earthquakes could be turned on and off by varying the rate at which water was injected and thus modulating reservoir pressure. In 2011 alone, a number of small to moderate earthquakes in the United States seem to have been triggered by injection of wastewater (11). These include earthquakes near Guy, Arkansas that occurred in February and March, where the largest earthquake was M 4.7. In the Trinidad/Raton area near the border of Colorado and New Mexico, injection of produced water associated with coalbed methane production seems to have triggered a number of earthquakes, the largest being a M 5.3 event that occurred in August. Earthquakes seem to have been triggered by wastewater injection near Youngstown, Ohio on Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve, the largest of which was M 4.0. Although the risks associated with wastewater injection are minimal and can be reduced even further with proper planning (11), the situation would be far more problematic if similar-sized earthquakes were triggered in formations intended to sequester CO2 for hundreds to thousands of years. Deep borehole stress measurements confirm the critically stressed nature of the crust in continental interiors (12), in some cases at sites directly relevant to the feasibility of large-scale CCS. For example, deep borehole stress measurements at the Mountaineer coal-burning power plant on the Ohio River in West Virginia indicate a severe limitation on the rate at which CO2 could be injected without the resulting pressure build-up initiating slip on preexisting faults (13). Because of the low permeability of the formations at depth, ((ul))pore pressure increases would be((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))expected to trigger slip on preexisting((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))faults if CO2 injection rates exceed((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))approximately 1% of the 7 million tons of((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))CO2 emitted((/ul)) by the Mountaineer plant ((ul))each year((/ul)). Similarly, stress measurements at Teapot Dome, Wyoming, the US government-owned oil field where pilot CO2 injection projects have been considered, show that very small pressure buildups are capable of triggering slip on some preexisting faults (14). ((ul))Dam construction and water reservoir((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))impoundment produce much smaller pore((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))pressure changes at depth than are likely to((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))occur with CO2 sequestration, but many((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))have triggered earthquakes at various sites((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))around the world((/ul)) (15) (red dots in Fig. 1). Except for the much smaller pore pressure increases at depth, reservoir-triggered earthquakes are a good analog for the potential for seismicity to be triggered by CO2 injection. Both activities cause pore pressure increases that act over large areas and are persistent for long periods. Three reservoir impoundments in eastern Canada (located in the ancient, stable core of the North American continent) triggered earthquakes as large as M 4.1 and M 5 at the two sites (Fig. 1), despite the fact that the pore pressure increases at depth were extremely small. Triggered Earthquakes and Seal Integrity Our principal concern is not that injection associated with CCS projects is likely to trigger large earthquakes; the problem is that even small to moderate ((ul))((hl))earthquakes threaten the seal integrity of a CO2 repository((/hl))((/ul)). In parts of the world with good construction practices, it is unusual for earthquakes smaller than approximately M 6 to cause significant human harm or property damage. Fig. 2 uses well established seismological relationships to show how the magnitude of an earthquake is related to the size of the fault that slipped and the amount of fault slip that occurred (16). As shown, faults capable of producing M ∼6 earthquakes are at least tens of kilometers in extent. (The fault size indicated along the abscissa is a lower bound of fault size as it refers to the size of the fault segment that slips in a given earthquake. The fault on which an earthquake occurs is larger than the part of the fault that slips in an individual event.) In most cases, such faults should be easily identified during geophysical site characterization studies and thus should be avoided at any site chosen for a CO2 repository. (Faults in crystalline basement rocks might be difficult to recognize in geophysical data. We assume, however, that any site chosen as a potential CO2 repository would be carefully selected, avoiding the possibility of pressure changes in the CO2 repository from affecting faults in crystalline basement.) The problem is that site characterization ((ul))studies can easily miss the much smaller((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))faults associated with small to moderate((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))earthquakes.((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))Although the ground shaking from((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))small- to moderate-sized earthquakes is((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))inconsequential, their impact on a CO2((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))repository would not be((/ul)). Most of the geologic formations to be used for long term storage of CO2 are likely to be at depths of approximately 2 km—deep enough for there to be adequate sealing formations to isolate the CO2 from the biosphere but not so deep as to encounter formations with very low permeability. Given large volumes of CO2 injected into selected formations for many decades, if ((ul))a ((/ul))((ul))((hl))small to moderate earth quake((/hl))((/ul)) were to be triggered in a geologic formation at approximately 2 km depth, it ((ul))((hl))could ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))jeopardize the seal integrity of the storage formation((/hl))((/ul)). For example, if a M ∼4 earthquake were to be triggered by CO2 sequestration (17)—an event that would be widely felt in a populated area but for which shaking would be unlikely to cause harm or damage—it would be associated with several centimeters of slip on a fault several kilometers in size. Because laboratory studies show that just a few millimeters of shear displacement are capable of enhancing fracture and joint permeability (18), ((ul))several centimeters((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))of slip would be capable of creating((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))a permeable hydraulic pathway that could((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))compromise the seal integrity of the CO2((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))reservoir and potentially reach the((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))near surface.((/ul))"],"stats":{"highlightedWords":67}},{"tag":"Perm do both - the CP is neither textually nor functionally competitive with the aff.\n((hl))Carbon taxes don’t have a substantial environmental difference- the CP can’t solve((/hl))","cite":"((hl))Green 12((/hl)) (Kenneth, Kenneth Green is an environmental scientist and director at the Fraser Institute, “Why a carbon tax is still a bad idea,” 8-28-12, http://www.aei.org/publication/why-a-carbon-tax-is-still-a-bad-idea/)[AK-Caddo]","text":["So let us, once again, review why ((ul))a carbon tax is a bad idea((/ul))((ul))((hl)): 1) Taxes on carbon are not simply taxes on consumption, they’re a tax on production as well((/hl))((/ul))((hl)),((/hl)) since energy is a primary input to production (and is a growing share because of increasing automation).

For those on the right, the concept of a \"revenue-neutral\" tax has held particular appeal. If the tax revenue goes toward other tax cuts or cash payments to households, government does not grow. ((ul))The CLC proposal adopts a pure cash-to-households approach, thus the \"dividend.\" The centrality of the dividend, however, is the giveaway that this is a political, not a policy, initiative. ((/ul))Perhaps taxing the consumption of cheap energy and then mailing every American a check is good politics. ((ul))The proposal promises to respond to the \"powerful trends\" that elevated Donald Trump to the White House, \"redirect this populist energy in a socially beneficial direction,\"((/ul)) and \"tip the economic scales towards the interests of the little guy,\" all while appealing to \"Asians and Hispanics--the fastest growing demographic groups.\" ((ul))Even if any of this were true, the policy would remain bad for the country, in ways that the proposal's authors fail to acknowledge, let alone address((/ul)). For instance, ((ul))the concept of revenue neutrality is a mirage((/ul)). Yes, every dollar raised by the tax can be sent back to households. Remember, though, that ((ul))((hl))the entire premise of the tax is to force households and businesses away from cheap fossil-fuel consumption and toward higher-cost((/hl))((/ul)) (but lower-emission) ((ul))((hl))alternatives((/hl))((/ul)). The extra money spent on these alternatives generates no tax revenue. As more energy consumption shifts toward these high-cost/low-emission sources, more of the economic burden of the policy takes an obviously non-neutral, non-refundable form. ((ul))((hl))The authors appear unaware of this, writing instead that \"[the dividend] amount would grow over time as the carbon tax rate increases, creating a positive feedback loop: the more the climate is protected, the greater the individual dividend payments to all Americans((/hl))((/ul)).\" But better climate protection requires eliminating emissions and thus the tax base that would fund dividend payments. ((ul))Far from creating a positive feedback loop, a system in which increasing tax rates squeeze ever-higher revenue out of ever-lower emissions creates a vicious cycle. ((/ul))Households bear the costs but receive no offsetting dividend because emissions-free technologies generate no carbon-tax revenue. A second problem, of which the authors must have been aware, is that ((ul))((hl))a tax-and-dividend model is bad for the economy. As the Congressional Budget Office has observed, there is \"a trade-off between the goals of helping those households most hurt by the tax and helping the economy in general((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).\"((/ul)) This is intuitively correct. If it were good economic policy to raise taxes and mail the ensuing revenue out to households, policymakers could have done that long ago with any old tax. The challenge was also confirmed by a comprehensive study, \"Implementing a U.S. Carbon Tax,\" published in 2015 by think tanks across the ideological spectrum. Reviewing the economic modeling for a number of different proposals, it found that ((ul))all had large net costs unless the tax revenue was used to cut taxes on capital. ((/ul))The authors ignore this, instead asserting without evidence that \"our plan would strengthen the economy,\" suggesting that the \"strategy would double as a growth strategy\" and even claiming that the cost to the country of adopting their plan is \"zero.\" Have so many Harvard economists and former Treasury secretaries ever jumped so enthusiastically at the promise of a free lunch?"],"stats":{"highlightedWords":100}},{"tag":"((hl))Carbon tax fails- 5 reasons((/hl))","cite":"((hl))IER((/hl)) No Date (Institute for Energy Research, The Institute for Energy Research is a not-for-profit organization that conducts intensive research and analysis on the functions, operations, and government regulation of global energy markets, “Carbon Taxes: Reducing Economic Growth- Achieving No Environmental Improvement,” http://instituteforenergyresearch.org/studies/carbon-tax-primer/)[AK-Caddo]","text":["((hl))1((/hl))((ul))((hl)). Carbon taxes are taxes on 85 percent of the energy we use. A carbon tax would impose a new tax on ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))the vast majority of((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) our nation’s economic activity((/hl))((/ul)). Fossil fuels power our nation and produce 85 percent of the energy we consume in the United States. [3] Nuclear and hydro power produced an additional 11 percent of our energy.[4] The remaining 4 percent comes from other renewables like biofuels, wind, and solar.[5] ((ul))Carbon taxes may make hydro and nuclear power more attractive, but few sites remain where it is possible to build large hydroelectric dams and new nuclear power plants face major political obstacles.((/ul)) ((hl))2. ((/hl))((ul))((hl))A carbon tax that is perfectly offset by other tax cuts is neither a practical nor a political reality. The history and nature of politics shows that once politicians institute a tax, they will not give it up((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) Still, some argue in favor of a “tax swap” to reduce income taxes while implementing a new tax on carbon dioxide emissions. Theoretically, this could make sense. However, ((ul))the argument does not reflect political reality.((/ul)) The first challenge for promoters of a carbon tax “tax swap” is getting lawmakers to pass a carbon tax. ((ul))Lawmakers are very wary of imposing easily identifiable taxes across the entire population((/ul)). Instead, politicians prefer to hide the costs of government programs, while rewarding discrete and identifiable groups. Implementing carbon taxes would result in an identifiable tax increase similar to the unpopular gas tax increases that led to voter displeasure revolts against President George H.W. Bush and President Bill Clinton. The second challenge for promoters of a “tax swap” is getting Congress to reduce income taxes. Congress could decrease some income taxes, but it is highly unlikely income taxes would be decreased for all income brackets. Taxpayers will likely fight against a “tax swap” because they understand there is nothing to stop future lawmakers from increasing carbon taxes or returning income taxes to their former levels. Worse, from a taxpayer’s perspective, a carbon tax will give lawmakers another vehicle to raise large amounts of tax revenue. ((ul))Some argue that a revenue-neutral “tax swap” would be economically beneficial. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))There is, however, little evidence politicians are concerned about the economic effectiveness of plans to reduce carbon dioxide emissions((/hl))((/ul)). Most economists agree that carbon taxes are a superior to cap and trade.[6] Carbon taxes are more transparent, more understandable, and less subject to political manipulation. Though economists prefer carbon taxes, congressmen strongly prefer cap and trade plans.[7] Lawmakers have floated many cap and trade proposals, but they have not discussed any serious carbon tax proposals. ((ul))Lawmakers say they favor economically efficient global warming plans, but their actions demonstrate that the discussion about efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is not about science or economics—it is about politics((/ul)). Offsetting income taxes with carbon taxes is not a political reality because politicians will not propose such obvious tax increases on all Americans. ((ul))((hl))3. Politicians like to reward special interest groups with new tax revenues. When politicians have large amounts of tax dollars at their disposal, they tend to spend it on projects that reward special interest groups((/hl))((/ul)). A carbon tax would likely generate over $1 trillion in new revenue. Much of this revenue would likely be spent on inefficient “pork” projects. The proposed cap and trade schemes contain hundreds of billions of dollars for special interests. The recession has spurred additional calls for hundreds of billions of dollars in additional spending to create “green jobs.” For example, the Center for American Progress is calling on Congress to spend $100 billion to create two million “green jobs”[8] and the Apollo Alliance wants Congress to spend $500 billion to create five million “green jobs.”[9] ((ul))If a carbon tax were in place, lawmakers would almost certainly divert resources to “green job” subsidies or other similar programs, rather than back into taxpayers’ wallets. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))4((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)). It is impossible to create an optimal carbon tax. A carbon tax would need to be set at an optimal level that accounts for the economy and climate science. This is an impossible task((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).((/hl)) One of the greatest insights of the 20th century was that economically efficient central planning is not possible. Friedrich Hayek and others demonstrated that central planners cannot aggregate all of the information necessary to make economically efficient choices.[10] Their insight remains true today((ul)). A planner (or Congress) cannot create an optimal tax because he or she does not have ((/ul))((ul))all of((/ul))((ul)) the necessary information.((/ul)) With global warming, ((ul))the lack of perfect information is further compounded by partisan politics and uncertain climate science.((/ul)) This makes it impossible to determine an optimal carbon tax. The cost of a carbon tax will increase the costs of nearly everything that is produced, manufactured, or transported, including food and gasoline. ((ul))How one would construct a credible methodology for accurately and precisely measuring and accounting for these effects remains, perhaps intentionally, an unaddressed question. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))5. A carbon tax is a regressive tax, but increased wealth transfers will likely make it increasingly progressive. Lower income families spend more of their income on energy than higher income families.((/hl))((/ul)) The Wall Street Journal explains: The Congressional Budget Office—Mr. Orszag’s former roost—estimates that the price hikes from a 15% cut in emissions would cost the average household in the bottom-income quintile about 3.3% of its after-tax income every year. That’s about $680, not including the costs of reduced employment and output. The three middle quintiles would see their paychecks cut between $880 and $1,500, or 2.9% to 2.7% of income. The rich would pay 1.7%.

Immigrants also contributed to the majority of patents filed by leading US companies in that period: 72% of the total at Qualcomm, 65% at Merck, 64% at General Electric, and 60% at Cisco Systems. Surprisingly, 40% of the international patent applications filed by the US government also had foreign-national authors.","Indians have achieved the most extraordinary success in Silicon Valley. They have founded more start-ups than the next four immigrant groups, from Britain, China, Taiwan, and Japan, combined. Despite comprising only 6% of the Valley’s population and 1% of the nations, Indians founded 15.5% of Silicon Valley startups and contributed to 14% of US global patents.","At the same time, I also realised that protectionist demands by nativists were causing American political leaders to advocate immigration policies that were (and are) choking US innovation and economic growth.

H-1B critics say there are enough Americans with technology degrees to fill all the country’s technical jobs.","In April, Trump rolled out another “America First” policy and announced changes to the program. He signed an executive order that may alter who gets the annual visas, saying he wants to ensure that only the highest-skilled, best-paid immigrant workers gain entry.

Thus, ((ul))((hl))states would be acting as sponsors on behalf of migrants whom they represent in their states((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) in the same way that they currently sponsor foreign-born students at state universities and other workers in their capacity as employers.((/ul))","In 2014, Brandon Fuller and Sean Rust authored a policy analysis for Cato that explored how a state-sponsored visa program could operate in the United States. They wrote a section addressing the constitutionality of such a program:","Historically, the Supreme Court has interpreted Congress to have “plenary power” over immigration, generally giving deference to the political branches of the federal government as an extension of the Naturalization Clause under Article 1, section 8, clause 4, which gives Congress the power “To establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization.”[1] Under current interpretations, this gives Congress the sole power to establish naturalization guidelines. However, ((ul))Congress can((/ul)) ((ul))also allow states to be involved((/ul)) ((ul))in immigration policy in areas besides naturalization, such as managing a state-based visa((/ul)) ((ul))within federal guidelines((/ul)). Some immigration policies, with the exception of naturalization, can be partly devolved to the states within a range of powers permitted by the federal government.","The recent case of Arizona v. the United States, which decided the constitutionality of Arizona’s strict immigration laws, reiterates the point that states are allowed to participate in immigration policy and enforcement, but only within the scope permitted by the federal government.[2] In debating the case of Arizona v. United States, Peter Spiro, an immigration law scholar at Temple University’s Beasley School of Law, wrote, “[I]n Arizona, the Supreme Court constricted the possibilities for unilateral state innovation on immigration, both good and bad. That does not stop the federal government from affirming state discretion.” A state-based visa program does just that—allowing states to participate in the selection of immigrants under guidelines permitted by the federal government which is consistent with current interpretations of the Supremacy Clause and the plenary power of the federal government in the matter of immigration.","((ul))It is also important to note that U.S. law defines a nonimmigrant visa holder as “an alien who seeks temporary entry to the United States for a specific purpose,” and the federal government may set conditions in accordance with this purpose. ((/ul))For example, in the current immigration system a foreign entrant may be required to be attached to a singular petitioning employer under a number of employer-based non-immigrant visas, such as the H-1B. Like holders of employment-based visas, state-based visa holders would be nonimmigrants with a temporary right to live and work in the United States and an option to pursue permanent residency. As such, the state-based system is simply a variation on the condition being attached to the foreign entrant.","((ul))The Johnson-Buck bill is a federally created visa that allows states to sponsor migrants that would operate by the guidelines established under the Supreme Court cases argued over the Arizona immigration enforcement laws. The same precedents that established that states can increase immigration enforcement beyond what the federal government intended, within the confines of a federal program, also allow states to choose whether to have more legal migrants und((/ul))((ul))er a federally managed system. ((/ul))","((ul))Naturalization is a ((/ul))((ul))solely federal power((/ul)) ((ul))that the state-sponsored bill does not interfere with((/ul)). If a worker on a state-sponsored visa finds an employer or a family member to sponsor him for lawful permanent residency then he will have full mobility, employment, and residence rights just like any green card holder.","((ul))The fed((/ul))eral government ((ul))currently runs the visa system in the United States and the Supreme Court has interpreted the Constitution to give Congress that power.

The Court asserted this role most aggressively in the 1876 ((/ul))((ul))Chy((/ul))((ul)) Lung case, which was brought by a group of female immigrants from China who were detained by the California port director((/ul))((ul)),((/ul)) demanding bonds of $500 each before he would allow them entry to the United States.8 Upon refusal to pay, some were detained by the director pending deportation.

That’s an inversion of what most of the Founding Fathers expected. James Madison and Thomas Jefferson, among many others, objected to the Alien Acts of 1798 in large part because the original meaning of the Constitution did not give Congress any general power to restrict immigration, but rather largely left the issue to the states.","((ul))We are unlikely to fully restore the original meaning of the Constitution((/ul)). But earlier this week, Republican Senator Ron Johnson (Wisconsin), and Representative Ken Buck (Republican, Colorado), put forward a proposal under which states would exercise considerably greater power over migration.

Let’s start with the former. Somin claims that, “the original meaning of the Constitution did not give Congress any general power to restrict immigration, but rather largely left the issue to the states.”","To back up his claim that Congress has no power to restrict immigration Ilya Somin cites, well… Ilya Somin, in a separate article he wrote for an outlet somewhat tellingly named “Open Borders.” I’m afraid I’m going to have to take issue with that somewhat daring interpretation which you can click through and read for yourself.","It’s true that the Founders didn’t seem to spend a great deal of time thinking about the question of immigration. Or if they did, the topic didn’t get a lot of play in the final cut of the document they produced. But it’s not entirely silent on the subject either. ((ul))((hl))Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))actually says((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) that Congress, not the states, shall have the power “to establish a uniform rule of naturalization((/hl))((/ul)).” Somin attempts to argue that naturalization is merely the process of becoming a citizen and not the physical act of entering the country, but that’s fairly thin gruel for this debate. In order to become a citizen, the process most certainly involves coming to the country unless you were born here (thus nullifying any questions of becoming a citizen). This is a distinction which the Founders clearly understood when they mentioned similar criteria in Article II Section 1.","But we don’t need to simply rely on those breadcrumbs to find out that the authors of the Constitution had already thought this through. ((ul))The Founders had given the subject even more consideration, because they followed that up in Article I Section 9 by saying, “The migration or importation of such persons as any of the states now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the year one thousand eight hundred and eight, but a tax or duty may be imposed on such importation, not exceeding ten dollars for each person((/ul)).” Clearly they were giving the states the right to make decisions on immigration in the short term, but it was very short indeed. Those powers were designed to expire in a handful of ((ul))years((/ul)) and they did so. Why on Earth would the Founders specifically reference the power of the states to regulate “migration or importation” (which obviously and absolutely describes immigration beyond any doubt) and put an expiration date on it unless they were talking about such power shifting to the federal government? Or, if we must dance on the same head of a semantic pin that Somin is relying on, even if the states had the power to regulate the migration or importation of aliens at the beginning, they were only assured that Congress would not “prohibit” it until 1808. After that, Congress could and did take charge. The premise being argued by Somin seems absurd in light of those facts.","Somin’s final argument seems to be that absent a clear mandate for the federal government to have this power it should go to the states. That’s an obvious reference to the Tenth Amendment and would clearly hold true were it not for the inconvenient fact that the Constitution does recognize the need for such authority and removes it from states following the year 1808.

As a central component of “illegality”—the sociopolitical condition of living in a country without legal status (De Genova 2002)—((ul))the prospect of deportation should not concern immigrants with legal standing, in theory. Nevertheless, we found that deportation was a source of stress((/ul)) for those we interviewed. For example, ((ul))immigrants with TPS who had been waiting for reapproval of the program((/ul)) and reregistering every eighteen months for several years ((ul))experienced a sense of anxiety that weighed heavily on them. Unable to access rights, services, and protections that come with greater legal stability, immigrants who obtain((/ul)) TPS and other ((ul))temporary((/ul)), humanitarian ((ul))statuses find themselves in a prolonged precarious space that can prevent them from settling and thriving.((/ul))","Compared to undocumented status, TPS certainly provides a few crucial resources for immigrants. TPS beneficiaries in this study, for example, were better able than undocumented immigrants to obtain higher paying jobs that offered benefits. They were also more likely to apply for worker’s compensation after an injury on the job, a right extended to all US workers regardless of legal standing but that many immigrants resist claiming (Gleeson 2012). One of the more telling examples of the benefits of TPS comes from the narrative of fifty-year-old Felipe. He migrated from El Salvador with a tourist visa that expired, and after a couple of months of being undocumented, he became eligible for the newly reinstated TPS program in 2001:","Felipe: The first months were hard . . . I didn’t want to be deported. But later, TPS came out and I went to apply right away and then things got better. Abrego: For example, what would you say changed? Felipe: Well, look, at first I was just doing these [informal] landscaping jobs that didn’t pay much, and I wasn’t satisfied with what I made. And then, with TPS, you just show your card and they give you a job that actually pays well, where you get days off, and you won’t be fired for just any reason.","After getting TPS, Felipe had the legal status and associated authorization to work, and found that he enjoyed greater pay and more stable employment. Prior to obtaining TPS, he earned about minimum wage, but feeling secure with his new EAD card,21 Felipe moved on to acquire a year-round job as a janitor for a large luxury apartment building that paid better wages than his informal landscaping job previously; during the summer he supplemented his income with landscaping at a golf course.","Yet despite his relatively high earnings in an otherwise low-income immigrant community, ((ul))Felipe lived with great stress((/ul)). In 2006, ((ul))he explained that he worked and saved as much money as he could while holding his temporary legal status because he knew that there was always a possibility that TPS would not be extended a((/ul))nother time and it would be difficult to live as an undocumented immigrant in the United States:","((ul))Depending on((/ul)) who is elected ((ul))president, the chances are that they will probably not give us TPS again and to be here undocumented, that’s not easy. ((/ul))Just a short time ago there was a[n Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)] raid and they took forty workers from one place nearby. Some of these other guys that I live with, they don’t have papers and they just stay home, and you can see it, they worry about being deported.","Aware of the economic repercussions and fear of deportation that haunts undocumented immigrants, ((ul))Felipe worried that he, too, could easily and momentarily lose even the limited protections of TPS. In turn, the fact that ((/ul))((ul))TPS did not offer a path to permanent residency((/ul))((ul)) made Felipe tentative about his ((/ul))((ul))future plans((/ul)). He recognized that ((ul))changing political tides might block((/ul)) a ((ul))renewal((/ul)) of TPS, ((ul))worsen his job prospects, and produce socioeconomic instability and a constant fear of deportation((/ul)) that he witnessed through his roommates’ experiences.","((ul))Another challenge of TPS that causes its beneficiaries to fear deportation is the seemingly unending paperwork and bureaucracy of the renewal process.((/ul)) TPS holders ((ul))must spend over $500 every eighteen months to renew their work permit and pay for fingerprints((/ul)).22 Some eligible immigrants become unable to reapply if they lack funds during their brief renewal window (Menjívar 2006). Moreover, because each national origin group has a different allotted period of time for renewal, the lack of consistency can get confusing. ((ul))Individuals may lose their((/ul)) TPS ((ul))protections upon the standing’s expiration and fall into undocumented status((/ul)).23 Such was the case for Milton who, after obtaining TPS the first eighteen-month period it was available for Salvadorans, failed to reapply during the two-month window while renewal applications were being accepted. Then unemployed, Milton simply did not have the means to pay the required fees. Having lost TPS, he lived in continual fear of being detained—even at home—because the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) had acquired all of his personal information in the process.","((ul))Even when they follow all the guidelines, immigrants with TPS are vulnerable to falling out of status at various points in the reregistration process((/ul)). In one example that was documented in a newspaper article, ((ul))a TPS holder moved to another home, and in changing his address, his paperwork was lost in the mail((/ul)) (Gorman 2008). ((ul))ICE agents then came to his new home to detain and deport him to El Salvador, even though he lived with his US citizen wife and children. Immigrants in other liminal((/ul)), humanitarian ((ul))legal standings were also not necessarily safe from detention or deportation.((/ul)) In our interviews, people mentioned cases they knew of in which ((ul))people with temporary((/ul))((ul)),((/ul)) humanitarian ((ul))standings had been deported((/ul))((ul))— whether because of authorities’ confusion surrounding individuals’ permission to be present in the country or due to administrative errors.((/ul)) Such errors are prevalent in a belabored legal and bureaucratic process that unfolds across various government agencies and civic and social institutions (Kanstroom 2007). ","Given the various points in the process at which mistakes can happen, many immigrants with humanitarian forms of relief live with great fear of being deported for matters beyond their control. Nina, a mother of two originally from Mexico, provides an example. As a VAWA beneficiary, Nina returned to her Equal Justice immigration attorney each year to renew her work permit. She had not been able to apply for permanent residency because she had entered the United States without inspection at the border—a matter that is not waived for deferred action recipients through VAWA. During a visit in 2009, Nina told Jackie, her lawyer, that her boyfriend had assaulted her; afterward, the police arrived and took a report. Expressing her laments that Nina had experienced domestic violence, Jackie pointed out that because of the event, Nina could apply for U Visa status. The violence could be transformed into something positive for Nina, because if she were granted U Visa standing, Nina could eventually apply for permanent residency. As a U Visa holder, the inadmissibility issue that blocked her path to residency through VAWA standing was capable of being waived by USCIS.24 This distinction is significant in that it highlights the legally-sanctioned differences among immigrants who are lawfully present in the United States that the undocumented–documented binary fails to capture. It also provides a view into the innumerable technicalities of each status that make it difficult for recipients, service providers, employers, and even attorneys to understand. In a social and political context that criminalizes immigrants, these technicalities cause further harm when they block immigrants’ ability to access legally granted rights.","Weeks later, Nina returned to EJLA to prepare a personal declaration for her U Visa application. Before the conclusion of Nina’s appointment, Jackie listed some supplementary documents Nina should gather for her petition. The lawyer instructed Nina to go to the Mexican consular office to obtain a passport from her country of origin. They would need to submit copies of the identification document to USCIS.","With a quiver in her voice, Nina asked Jackie if “Immigration” was going to be there when she got her passport. Jackie said no. The attorney clarified that the Mexican consular office was [in] downtown [Los Angeles], just like the Immigration [USCIS and ICE] offices were, but that the Consulate was a support office for immigration-related issues. Nina silently nodded her head in acknowledgment, paused, and then asked Jackie if she would be deported if her U Visa application were not approved. Jackie said no, but quickly qualified her response: “nothing is 100 percent secure.” Jackie told Nina that she was more secure than others in her position because she had an “approved VAWA.” The lawyer added: “However, we [immigration attorneys] can’t control what Immigration does. You need to be careful.” Nina nodded again, asking a third question. Could she be deported if Immigration showed up at the garment factory where she worked? Jackie replied that if something like that happened, first of all, Nina should call her immediately. The attorney explained that with her status through VAWA, Nina had “some protection” from deportation, but she would have “even more” with U Visa standing since she could apply for permanent residency after three years.25 ","When Nina left, Jackie explained to Lakhani that she always advised her clients who obtain status through VAWA to “be careful,” because “you don’t want them in prison under any circumstances. Even with an approved VAWA, if ICE does a prison sweep, you can get caught up in that and deported, and have a very difficult time getting back in the country.” Although Nina had legal status and permission to seek numerous employment positions, her socioeconomic status (six years of formal education, a limited work history, and minimal English proficiency) channeled her to a manufacturing job where she labored alongside undocumented immigrants. And as a Mexican-origin immigrant residing in a nation whose undocumented population is 80 percent Latino and nearly 60 percent Mexican (Hill and Hayes 2013), Nina’s US social standings in a racist, anti-immigrant context further mitigated the sense of security her humanitarian legal status should have provided. Nina’s concerns and her lawyer’s reactions point to the instability of temporary, humanitarian legal statuses in the daily lives of recipients, as well as the limits of attorneys’ assistance in the face of immigration authorities.","((ul))The lens of legal violence ((/ul))(Menjívar and Abrego 2012) ((ul))reveals that fear of deportation or “deportability((/ul))” (De Genova 2002) ((ul))is a fundamental experience((/ul)) for undocumented immigrants.

((ul))She had recently found another job where she was very unhappy as a janitor at a retirement community((/ul)). She prayed daily for her green card to arrive in the mail, commenting, “I don’t want to be treated like undocumented people anymore.”","Vera, who had been born in Mexico but raised in the United States since age two, explained that she felt stuck. “[F]or school, I can’t do anything. ((ul))You’re on your own without a green card.” Without financial aid for college20 and knowing that employers may not accept her EAD, Vera was unable to access well-paying jobs. Others’ suspicion and unwillingness to recognize her legal standing prevented her from fulfilling its full potential. This produced a condition of dependency that held Vera back socioeconomically and on a psychic level. The legal violence framework’s focus on intended and unintended consequences of immigration policies captures this sense of marginality.((/ul)) Such marginality contributed to Vera ((ul))feeling as if she was still undocumented, living in liminality despite having garnered legal status.((/ul))","((ul))Other respondents described similar experiences of disenfranchisement in temporary((/ul)), humanitarian legal ((ul))statuses as they attempted to mobilize their legal standing to acquire employment and access critical social services((/ul)). Irma, a forty-one-year-old mother of two from Mexico, had adjusted her status from undocumented to U Visa holder in 2008. Meeting with her Network attorney and Lakhani in 2011, it surfaced that the work permit Irma received with her U Visa standing had not helped her obtain a job in the mainstream economy. Instead, she had pieced together a monthly income of about $1,110:","What happens is that if you call me and you say, “Can you clean my house?” “Oh,” I say to you, “Yes.” And if someone else calls and says to me, “Can you take my dog out for a walk?” I tell them, “Yes.” It’s like, I do a lot of things for money, but I don’t have an office. Normally, I clean houses. Right now a friend of mine has a beauty salon, and she doesn’t have anyone who helps her cut hair. So I go with her, and she pays me because I keep the salon clean, organized. For example, she tells me, “Oh, wash her hair.” She says, “You’re my assistant.” So I also do that.","Given the complicated nature of her work situation, Irma had difficulty converting her legal standing to social services benefits she was entitled to as a U Visa holder. Her explanation highlights the precariousness of humanitarian legal standings:","((ul))One time [the welfare office] cut off((/ul)) my ((ul))food stamps because I didn’t bring them proof that says, “Here’s my income.” Why? Because the person pays me cash. She wouldn’t give me a letter. If I say((/ul)) [to the caseworkers], ((ul))“I work with Maria and Juana,” they want the person I work for to write a letter for me that says, “She comes with me on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from 2:00 to 5:00.” And when I asked the person, “Will you write me a letter?” “Oh no, I don’t want to wind up with problems.” ((/ul))They are scared about what I’m going to do with the employment paper. When they don’t give it to me, I say to myself, they’re doing me a favor hiring me. I can’t be demanding too much. It’s really difficult when people [caseworkers] want a paper, because you end up saying it’s better not to apply.","((ul))Unable to parlay her U Visa status into a formal job, Irma was left in the vulnerable position of asking her multiple, reluctant informal employers to vouch for her work. This series of events is not uncommon among immigrants with temporary, ((/ul))humanitarian ((ul))forms of relief who, despite being legally present in the country, are nonetheless limited in their ability to draw tangible benefits—including ((/ul))((ul))stable and remunerative jobs, educational experience, and healthcare((/ul))((ul))—from their acquired legality((/ul)).","((ul))Legal status shapes immigrants’ and their families’ incorporation experiences in various public spheres, including access to employment and educational opportunities and social services benefits.

((ul))Thus, immigrants’ ability to secure these resources facilitates or blocks opportunities for upward mobility.

((/ul))Therefore, although respondents indicated that they were able to achieve more socioeconomic stability when they transitioned from undocumented to humanitarian legal statuses, their prospects for sustained mobility and integration remained constrained by their ambiguous legal positions in a social context influenced by anti-immigrant attitudes, policy limitations, and shortcomings during implementation.

Immigrants in this study signaled their approved legal standing to caseworkers, employers, and educational staff via an ((ul))EAD, the primary identity document associated with their temporary, ((/ul))humanitarian((ul)) legal statuses((/ul)). But furnishing EADs((ul)) did not consistently enable migrants to access services they qualified for, obtain or hold onto jobs, or complete a college education.18 This left immigrants ((/ul))((ul))vulnerable to blocked educational and financial mobility.((/ul))","For example, ((ul))some immigrants in liminal, humanitarian legal standings who were eligible for ((/ul))((ul))public benefits did not apply for them((/ul)) when dissuaded by misinformed social services workers. In these cases, ((ul))immigrants preferred to go without key resources because it was “safer.”((/ul)) Such was the case for Melody, a VAWA recipient from Guatemala who was compiling paperwork for her adjustment to residency. In a meeting with Charlotte, an Equal Justice attorney, ((ul))Melody mentioned her problem accessing public benefits. Her Department of Public Social Services’ caseworker alleged that drawing welfare entitlements could affect Melody’s ability to obtain a green card. ((/ul))Visibly upset, Charlotte responded to Melody, “Some people think that, but for people with VAWA, that’s not true.” Affirming to Melody that she did qualify and that getting benefits would not affect her residency, Charlotte asked if Melody had given the caseworker the letter she wrote for her that explained her legal eligibility for resources. Melody answered that she had, but the caseworker repeated her warning, so Melody was hesitant to apply.","Following immigration and welfare reforms in the 1990s, immigrants applying for permanent residency who had previously procured public benefits—even if they had done so legally—were deemed “public charges” and faced significant delays in their legalization applications; in some cases, they were even unable to become residents (Park 2011). Immigrants with humanitarian forms of relief, including VAWA deferred action, U Visa status, and asylum, are not subject to the same public charge constraints as other immigrants19 and may receive benefits without ramifications for their residency. But caseworkers unfamiliar with the nuances of the public charge rules, especially when informed by an anti-immigrant political context, can prevent eligible individuals from acquiring support that could help stabilize their lives and facilitate socioeconomic mobility. In Melody’s case, despite her attorney’s reassurances, she decided to try to live without the food stamps, cash aid, and Medi-Cal for which her VAWA deferred action qualified her. As a single mother, Melody and her children stood to gain a great deal from these forms of assistance, but she felt cornered into forgoing health care because it seemed necessary to eventually obtain the more recognizable and advantageous residency. Amidst an anti-immigrant climate of legal violence that pervades benefit agencies and immigrant communities alike, immigrant respondents were often tentative to mobilize social services that their humanitarian legal statuses conferred upon them. Humanitarian relief recipients faced a complex interaction of immigration, welfare, and criminal laws, and inadequately trained service providers that forced them to make difficult resource-related decisions (Broder and Blazer 2011; Hagan, Rodriguez, and Nika 2003).","((ul))In some instances((/ul)), humanitarian ((ul))legal statuses categorically ((/ul))((ul))denied immigrants access to socioeconomic resources((/ul))((ul)), clearly blocking their mobility.((/ul)) Samira, an EJLA attorney, described the situation of one of her clients, a young man from El Salvador. Pedro, age eighteen, had recently won asylum after a court battle that lasted years. As an asylee, ((ul))Pedro could apply for jobs, but barriers loomed that could prevent him from the mobility path he desired((/ul)). As Samira explained in an interview, “his dream was to work with the police . . . but he can’t do that now because he’s still only an asylee.” ((ul))A variety of jobs that provide economic stability and highly desired health benefits—including positions in government, law enforcement, and the medical field—are off limits to immigrants with ((/ul))humanitarian ((ul))legal statuses who ((/ul))((ul))must wait until they obtain green cards before applying((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) Asylees are eligible to apply for permanent residency after one year in status, but Pedro’s case (and many others like his) was complicated. The government attorney who opposed Pedro’s claim for asylum in immigration court had appealed the judge’s grant of status, so Pedro’s legal standing was in flux. Although his asylum status would stand while the government’s appeal ran its course, he would not be able to apply for residency until and unless the case closed and his political asylum was upheld, a process that could drag on for several years. As Samira elaborated, this was a daunting prospect, not only because it continued Pedro’s sense of instability, but also because:","The immigration courts are backed up for upwards of a year or more for these things, so while his case sits in a courtroom and is delayed for who knows how long, the young man cannot apply for residency.

Why Aren't We?: An Economic Perspective”, Social Research, Fall2015, Vol. 82 Issue 3, p727)","text":["The Benefits of Mitigation Are Modest and Delayed The ((ul))popular literature on climate change is rife with claims that climate change is equivalent to an apocalypse. Whether climate change leads to an apocalypse depends on many factors, including no mitigation, no adaptation, and unlucky uncertain events((/ul)). Probably the three most frightening images of climate change are tropical cyclones, floods, and droughts. Although all these events are likely to occur in a future climate, they are also an integral component of the current climate. We already have droughts, floods, and tropical cyclones. The question is, how will these things change? According to economic models of fossil fuel consumption((ul)), emissions of greenhouse gases are expected to double the concentrations of greenhouse gases((/ul)) from preindustrial levels of 275 part per million equivalent (ppme) to 550 ppme ((ul))by 2040–2050. It will take more than another 100 years to double concentrations((/ul)) again to 1,100 ppme ((ul))in the absence of mitigation. ((/ul))((ul))So((/ul))((ul)) despite the fact that fossil fuel consumption is causing a vast quantity of annual emissions((/ul)), ((ul))it takes a very long time for((/ul)) the ((ul))concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to double. ((/ul))According to climate models, a doubling of concentrations is expected to increase long-run average global temperature by 3°C, with a range between 1.5 and 4.5 degrees (IPCC 2014a). However, ((ul))there is a((/ul)) ((ul))long lag((/ul)) ((ul))between an increase in concentrations and the resulting temperature increase. One must warm the ocean to warm the climate. It takes several decades just to warm the upper layers of the ocean((/ul)). ((ul))It takes centuries for the long-run temperature to be reached((/ul)). The rising temperature is expected to increase the speed of the hydrological cycle. This will lead to an increase in evaporation, an increase in precipitation, and an increase in the amount of water in the atmosphere. Water vapor itself is a greenhouse gas. It represents a positive feedback mechanism and it contributes significantly to the prediction of a 3°C increase from doubling greenhouse gases. So the expectation of increased rainfall is part of the explanation why there is such a large temperature increase. That does not mean there will be increased rainfall everywhere. It simply means that average global rainfall will increase. The level of CO2 has a direct effect on ecosystems. All plants respond to higher CO2 levels in a positive fashion. Grasses respond only slightly to CO2 fertilization, whereas the yields of most crops respond vigorously. Hundreds of laboratory studies reveal an average increase in crop yields of 30 percent as CO2 concentrations double (Kimball 2007). Climate change is expected to melt ice formations. Many glaciers on land have already shrunk in response to warming, increasing flows in nearby rivers. The Arctic ice covering the sea in the North Pole is shrinking rapidly, exposing the Arctic air to the warm sea underneath and causing the most rapid warming on the planet (IPCC 2014a). Large remaining glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica might melt over the next thousand years (IPCC 2014a). The melting of the large ice deposits in Greenland and Antarctica would cause the oceans to rise to new levels never before experienced by mankind. Climate change is expected to have one final impact. In addition to the mean temperature and precipitation levels rising, there may be a change in the distribution of weather. Seasonal patterns may change with more warming in winter than summer. Interannual variance might change. Diurnal variance may drop as nights become warmer relative to days. Tropical cyclones may become more powerful. The pattern of global winds may change, shifting moisture from one place to another. More is known about global mean changes than these other changes in the distribution. It is more difficult to study variance and even more difficult to study extreme events. But it is likely that the distribution of weather events will change. What then is the consequence of climate change if greenhouse gases cause all these changes? What sectors of the economy are vulnerable? What nonmarket goods and services are at risk? The literature on impacts has long identified most of the sectors likely to be affected by climate change (Pearce et al. 1996). The vulnerable economic sectors include agriculture, coasts, forests, water, and energy. Important sectors outside the economy that would be affected include recreation, ecosystem change, human health, and aesthetics. The controversy about impacts does not concern what will be affected. The controversy is measuring the magnitude of the impact. Some studies report damages to mankind equal to 20 percent of total income (Stern 2007). Other ((ul))studies suggest more modest effects of less than 2 percent of income((/ul)) (Pearce et al. 1996; Nordhaus 1991). ((ul))Yet other studies suggest impacts may be closer to 0.2 percent of income((/ul)) (Mendelsohn et al. 2006). What explains estimates that vary by orders of magnitude? ((ul))Although some authors((/ul)) ((ul))speculate about exponentially increasing damage((/ul)) (Stern 2007), ((ul))empirical analysis suggests((/ul)) that ((ul))most sectors respond to temperature in a hill-shaped fashion((/ul)) (Mendelsohn and Schlesinger 1999; Tol 2002a). ((ul))For each sector, there is an ideal temperature where the net value of that sector is highest((/ul)). If temperatures are either colder or warmer than this ideal, warming will be either beneficial or harmful, respectively. Three important insights follow from this result. First, ((ul))warming will be beneficial to relatively cool countries and harmful to relatively warm countries. Warming will not have the same universal effect on everybody((/ul)). Low-latitude countries may well suffer 60 to 80 percent of the global damage (Mendelsohn et al. 2006). This is problematic because these low-latitude countries collectively contribute only a small fraction of global emissions. A large fraction of the damage from climate change is not suffered by the countries causing the emissions. There is an inherent inequity in the distribution of the costs and benefits of greenhouse gas emissions. Second, the warmer the planet gets, the more damage that warming will cause. More and more countries will be pushed beyond the ideal temperature range, and the more local temperatures exceed that range, the greater the damage will be. Third, because the most serious damage requires relatively high temperatures, ((ul))a large fraction of the damage will not occur until far into the future((/ul)). The present value of damage is consequently quite small. The literature also contains one other important insight. ((ul))Adaptation is very effective at lowering climate damage((/ul)) (Mendelsohn and Neumann 1999; Mendelsohn and Dinar 2009). ((ul))Firms, farms, and people will all change their behavior as climate changes.((/ul)) ((ul))They will subtly adjust their timing, their choices, and their management to ((/ul))((ul))take into account((/ul))((ul)) the climate that they actually live in((/ul)). One can see this today by comparing the behavior of people who happen to live in different climates. Farmers in warmer places plant crops suitable for that climate. People wear clothing appropriate to their climate and season. Buildings have heating and cooling systems appropriate for each climate. People and firms adapt to climate because it is in their interest to do so. ((ul))Adaptation makes them better off((/ul)). That does not imply there are no damages. It simply points out that ((ul))assuming zero adaptation is not realistic((/ul)). ((ul))The damage is much lower when people adjust.((/ul))((ul)) It may be more difficult to predict what will happen with adaptation((/ul)), ((ul))but simply assuming it away leads to overly pessimistic predictions of damage((/ul)). ((ul))Predictions of impacts from climate change must take private adaptation into account in order to provide accurate measures of future damages((/ul)) (Mendelsohn 2000).

Secondary ((ul))studies((/ul)), however, generally ((ul))ignore this facet((/ul)) of the hypothesis. ((ul))The IPCC believes that a warmer world will harm human health((/ul)) ((ul))due((/ul)), for example, ((ul))to increased disease, malnutrition, heat-waves, floods, storms, and cardiovascular incidents((/ul)). As already noted ((ul))there is no basis for the claim about severe-weather-related threats or malnutrition((/ul)). The claim about heat-related deaths gained a boost during the summer of 2003 because of the tragedy of some 15,000 alleged heat-related deaths in France as elderly people stayed behind in city apartments without air conditioning while their children enjoyed the heat at the sea shore during the August vacation. Epidemiological studies of so-called \"excess\" deaths resulting from heat waves are abused to get the desired results. Similar studies of the impact of cold spells show that they are far more lethal than heat waves and that it is much easier to adapt to heat than to cold.53 More fundamentally, this, like most of the alarmist literature, ignores the basics of the AGW hypothesis: the world will not see an exponential increase in summer, daytime heat (and thus more heat waves), but a decrease in night-time and winter cooling, particularly at higher latitudes and altitudes. Based on the AGW hypothesis, Canada, China, Korea, Northern Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Chile, and Argentina will see warmer winters and warmer nights. There are clear benefits to such a development, even if there may also be problems, but the AGW industry tends to ignore the positive aspects of their alarmist scenarios. The feared ((ul))spread of malaria((/ul)), a much repeated claim, ((ul))is largely unrelated to climate((/ul)). ((ul))Malaria’s worst recorded outbreak((/ul)) ((ul))was in Siberia long before there was any discussion of AGW((/ul)). Similarly, the building of the Rideau Canal in Ottawa in the 1820s was severely hampered by outbreaks of malaria due to the proximity of mosquito-infested wetlands in the area. Malaria remains widespread in tropical countries today in part because of the UN’s lengthy embargo on the use of DDT, the legacy of an earlier alarmist disaster. Temperature is but one factor, and a minor one at that, in the multiple factors that affect the rise or decline in the presence of disease-spreading mosquitoes. Wealthier western countries have pursued public health strategies that have reduced the incidence of the dis- ease in their countries. Entomologist Paul Reiter, widely recognized as the leading specialist on malaria vectors and a contributor to some of the early work of the IPCC, was aghast to learn how his careful and systematic analysis of the potential impacts had been twisted in ways that he could not endorse. In a recent paper, he concludes: “Simplistic reasoning on the future prevalence of malaria is ill-founded; malaria is not limited by climate in most temperate regions, nor in the tropics, and in nearly all cases, ’new' malaria at high altitudes is well below the maximum altitudinal limits for transmission. Future changes in climate may alter the prevalence and incidence of the disease, but obsessive emphasis on ’global warming' as a dominant parameter is indefensible; the principal determinants are linked to ecological and societal change, politics and economics.”54 ((ul))Catastrophic species loss((/ul)) ((ul))similarly has((/ul)) ((ul))little foundation in past experience((/ul)).55 ((ul))Even if the GHG hypothesis were to be correct((/ul)), ((ul))its impact would be slow((/ul)), ((ul))providing significant scope and opportunity for adaptation((/ul)), ((ul))including ((/ul))((ul))by ﬂora and fauna((/ul)). One of the more irresponsible claims was made by a group of UK ((ul))modelers((/ul)) who ((ul))fed wildly improbable scenarios and data into their computers and produced the much-touted claim of massive species loss((/ul)) by the end of the century. ((ul))There are literally((/ul)) ((ul))thousands of websites((/ul)) ((ul))devoted to spreading alarm about species loss((/ul)) and biodiversity. ((ul))Global warming is((/ul)) ((ul))but one of many claimed human threats to the planet’s biodiversity((/ul)). ((ul))The claims,((/ul)) fortunately, ((ul))are largely hype((/ul)), based on computer models and the estimate by Harvard naturalist Edward O. Wilson that 27,000 to 100,000 species are lost annually - a figure he advanced purely hypothetically but which has become one of the most persistent of environmental urban myths. The fact is that ((ul))scientists((/ul)) ((ul))have no idea of the extent of the world's ﬂora and fauna((/ul)), with estimates ranging from five million to 100 million species, and that ((ul))there are no reliable data about the rate of loss((/ul)). By some estimates, ((ul))95 per cent of the species that ever existed have been lost over the eons((/ul)), most before humans became major players in altering their environment. A much more credible estimate of recent species loss comes from a surprising source, the UN Environmental Program. It reports that known ((ul))species loss is slowing reaching its lowest level in 500 years((/ul)) in the last three decades of the 20th century, with some 20 reported extinctions despite increasing pressure on the biosphere from growing human population and industrialization.57 The alarmist community has also introduced the scientifically unknown concept of \"locally extinct,” often meaning little more than that ((ul))a species of plant or animal has responded to adverse conditions by moving to more hospitable circumstances((/ul)), e.g., birds or butterflies becoming more numerous north of their range and disappearing at its extreme southern extent. Idso et al. conclude: “Many ((ul))species have shown the ability to((/ul)) ((ul))adapt rapidly to changes in climate((/ul)). ((ul))Claims that global warming threatens((/ul)) large numbers of species with ((ul))extinction((/ul)) ((ul))typically rest on((/ul)) a false definition of extinction (the loss of a particular population rather than en- tire species) and ((ul))speculation rather than real-world evidence((/ul)).
