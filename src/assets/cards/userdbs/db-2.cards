Settlers obviously need to be((/ul)) doing our own work and ((ul))challeng((/ul))((ul))ing ‘our’ institutions and practices that((/ul)) serve to protect or ((ul))further colonization. But we ((/ul))((ul))can’t do this((/ul))((ul)) if we flatten the diff((/ul))((ul))((hl))erences and ignore the inequalities and power relationships that exist within settler society. Not only does such flattening ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))prevent((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) much needed ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))alliances((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) but flattening((/hl))((/ul)) itself ((ul))((hl))can((/hl))((/ul)) actually work to ((ul))((hl))protect((/hl))((/ul)) certain ((ul))((hl))elements of settler colonialism((/hl))((/ul)). For instance, white supremacy works to naturalize white settler presence. In terms of solidarity then, I find it problematic for myself, as a white, class privileged, cis-hetero, and able bodied male (as well as people like me) to demand other peoples to act in solidarity, while also not holding myself (and others like me) responsible and accountable to other forms of violence that may be a contributing factor to the further reification of structures that support settler colonialism, like the State. Now I’m not arguing for the continued eschewal of Indigenous governance and legal orders because others experience violence, but rather, that ((ul))the substantive recognition of Indigenous governance and legal orders also requires a dismantling of other, related forms of domination((/ul)). This latter dismantling I see as necessary but also insufficient for the dismantling of settler colonialism. These ((ul))sites and spaces of domination and resistance are distinct, but((/ul)) also ((ul))connected dialectically. This seems to be something that settlers, white settlers specifically, have yet to articulate and take up, critique and act against((/ul)). And ((ul))this is((/ul)) perhaps ((ul))most evident in how settlers seem to be continuously waiting for instruction from Indigenous peoples on how to act((/ul)). Rita: I wonder if this relational approach is a more useful direction for settler colonial studies, not unlike the kind of work you do Jeff, in thinking about colonialism in a global, comparative context. Jeff: And I think, the more you can make those links, the British occupation of Maori territory is directly related to HBC’s strategy to begin treaty making here... All those things are interrelated. They are shared, and they are seen as shared strategies. The other thing I see is this impulse to delocalize it... it’s always that kind of Free Tibet Syndrome... the further away acts of genocide are from your location, the more outrage expressed at these injustices. It’s a way of avoiding complicity, but it’s also a way of recasting the gaze. It’s like, ‘We’re not going to look right here, because this appears to be fairly peaceful’ And so it’s always that sort of re-directing away from localized responsibility, and almost magnifying impacts farther away. ((ul))Rita((/ul)): So what settler colonial studies does do, is help us relocate to locality, which is helpful. You mention the HBC. I wonder what was the relationship between the Hudson Bay Company in Canada and the East India Company or the East Africa Company? ((ul))If we’re thinking about settler colonialism as a structure, how is it related to other modalities of gendered and sexualized white supremacy?((/ul)) How are the logics of State sovereignty and authority over nonwhite bodies connected? ((ul))If we’re thinking about it, as non-Indigenous peoples being ‘in solidarity’, part of that is locating, attacking the whole structure of imperialism that is deeply gendered and homonationalist, that depends on neo-liberal projects of prioritizing able-bodied workers who ((/ul))((ul))can serve capitalism((/ul)). ((ul))Corey: Part of this((/ul)), I think, what we’ve been discussing here, ((ul))relates to((/ul)) what I sometimes see as ((ul))the framing of ‘settler’ as event, rather than structure – where we are perhaps overly focused on the question of ‘who’ at the expense of the ‘how’. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))If we don’t understand how settlers are produced we ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))run the risk((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) of ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))represent((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))ing settlers as some sort of ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))transhistorical subject with transhistorical practice((/hl))((/ul))((ul))s((/ul)). So I’m worried that ((ul))while in one moment the term ‘settler’ denaturalizes((/ul)) our – that is ((ul))all non-Indigenous peoples((/ul)) – ((ul))presence on Indigenous lands((/ul)), in the next, and ((ul))through this construction of the ‘settler’ as transhistorical, we ((/ul))((ul))renaturalize it((/ul)). In short, ((ul))we go from a disavowal of colonization, to its ((/ul))((ul))representation as inevitable((/ul))((ul)). Here is where((/ul)) I think ((ul))a ((/ul))((ul))historical materialist((/ul)) or genealogical ((ul))approach((/ul))((ul)) to the production of settler subjects may be useful in ((/ul))((ul))show((/ul))((ul))ing how this production is conditioned by but also contingent on a number of factors – white supremacy, hetero-patriarchy, ((/ul))((ul))capitalism((/ul))((ul)), colonization, the eschewal of Indigenous governance and legal orders, environmental degradation, etc.((/ul)) Now this is also not to say that the binary of Indigenous/Settler isn’t accurate. I think its fundamental. Rather, I think ((ul))it is((/ul)) possible and ((ul))important to recognize that there((/ul)) have been, and ((ul))are((/ul)), ((ul))individuals((/ul)) (((ul))or((/ul)) even ((ul))collectives((/ul))) ((ul))that might be referred to as something other than settlers by Indigenous peoples, perhaps as cousins((/ul)). Or in a similar vein, that ((ul))there have been and are practices by settlers that ((/ul))((ul))aren’t colonial((/ul)) (((ul))and here is where centering Indigenous peoples’ accounts of Indigenous-settler relations, as well as their own governance, legal and diplomatic orders is crucial((/ul))). But I think ((ul))it’s just as important to recognize that these relations have and do not occur despite settler colonial and imperial logics, and((/ul)) thus ((ul))outside of the binary((/ul)). Rather, ((ul))such relations occur in the face of it((/ul)). The binary then is fundamental as the logics that uphold the binary cannot be ignored due to the existence of possiblly good relations as the logics that uphold the binary threaten those relations through the pursuit of the elimination of Indigenous peoples. Rita: Yet, how do we act in light of these entanglements, and with, rather than overcoming differences? ((ul))Corey((/ul)): Tuck and Yang (2012) had this really great article, “Decolonization is not a Metaphor.” In it, they talk about the importance of an ethics of incommensurability – a recognition of how anti-racist and anti-capitalist struggles are incommensurable with decolonization. But what I’ve been thinking about recently is whether these struggles are incompatible. For example, in the Indigenous resurgence literature, there is a turn away, but it’s also not an outright rejection. It also demands settlers to change. Yet ((ul))((hl))recognizing that settlers are (re)produced, the change demanded is ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))not just an individual transformation((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)), but one ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))connected((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) to broader social, economic, and political justice. There are((/hl))((/ul)) then, it seems, potential ((ul))lines of affinity((/ul))((ul)) between decolonization and others((/ul)), though incommensurable, ((ul))struggles((/ul)). And ((ul))((hl))in order to sustain this compatibility((/hl))((/ul)) in the face of incommensurability, ((ul))((hl))relationships are essential((/hl))((/ul)) in order ((ul))to maintain accountability and to resist repeating colonial and other relations of domination, as well as((/ul)), in very strategic terms, ((ul))in supporting each other’s resistance((/ul)).

The great autopoietic sociological systems theorist, Niklas Luhmann, makes this point nicely. For Luhmann, there are intra-systemic references and inter-systemic references. Intra-systemic references refer to processes that are strictly for the sake of reproducing or maintaining the system in question. Take the example of a cell. A cell, for-itself, is not for anything beyond itself. The processes that take place within the cell are simply for continuing the existence of the cell across time. While the cell might certainly emit various chemicals and hormones as a result of these processes, from its own intra-systemic perspective, it is not for the sake of affecting these other cells with those hormones. They’re simply by-products. Capitalism or economy is similar. Capitalists talk a good game about benefiting the rest of the world through the technologies they produce, the medicines they create (though usually it’s government and universities that invent these medicines), the jobs they create, etc., but really the sole aim of any corporation is identical to that of a cell: to endure through time or reproduce itself through the production of capital. This production of capital is not for anything and does not refer to anything outside itself. These operations of capital production are intra-systemic. By contrast, inter-systemic operations would refer to something outside the system and its auto-reproduction. They would be for something else. Luhmann argues that every autopoietic system has this sort of intra-systemic dimension. Autopoietic systems are, above all, organized around maintaining themselves or enduring. This raises serious questions about academic political theory. ((ul))((hl))Academia ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))is an autopoietic system.((/ul)) As an autopoietic system, ((ul))it((/ul))((ul))((hl)) aims to ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))endure, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))reproduce itself((/hl))((/ul)), etc. ((ul))It must engage in operations or procedures from moment to moment to do so. These operations consist((/ul))((ul))((hl)) in the production of students that ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))eventually ((/ul))((ul))((hl))become scholars ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))or professors, the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))writing((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) of ((/ul))((ul))((hl))articles((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))giving((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) of ((/ul))((ul))((hl))conferences((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), the production of books and classes((/ul)), etc. ((ul))All of these are operations through ((/ul))((ul))((hl))which ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))the academic system ((/ul))((ul))((hl))maintains((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))itself((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) across time((/ul)). ((ul))The horrifying ((/ul))((ul))((hl))consequence((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) of this ((/ul))((ul))((hl))is that ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))the reasons we might give for ((/ul))((ul))((hl))why we do what we do((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) might((/ul)) (and ((ul))((hl))often)((/hl))((/ul)) ((ul))((hl))have little to do with((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))what’s actually taking((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))place((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) in system continuance((/ul)). ((ul))((hl))We say that our articles are designed to demolish capital, inequality, sexism, homophobia((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), climate disaster, etc., ((/ul))((ul))((hl))but if we look((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))at how this system actually functions((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) we suspect that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the references((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) here ((/ul))((ul))((hl))are only intra-systemic((/hl))((/ul)), that they are only ((ul))((hl))addressing the choir or other((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))academics((/hl))((/ul)), that they are ((ul))only about ((/ul))((ul))((hl))maintaining that system((/hl))((/ul)), and that ((ul))((hl))they never proliferate through the broader world((/hl))((/ul)).

Seen in this light, it becomes clear that our talk about changing the world is a sort of alibi, a sort of rationalization, for a very different set of operations that are taking place. ((ul))Just as the capitalist says he’s trying to benefit the world,((/ul)) ((ul))the academic tries to say he’s trying to change the world when all he’s really doing is maintaining a particular operationally closed autopoietic system.((/ul)) ((ul))How to break this closure is a key question for any truly engaged political theory.

It ((ul))rests on the recent discovery of a non-modern “multinaturalist” ontology within indigenous myths((/ul))(Viveiros de Castro 1998). Yet, as Terry Turner (2009) shows, ((ul))the figure of this “Amerindian ((/ul))((ul))cosmology” is based on ((/ul))((ul))ethnographic misrepresentation.((/ul))((ul))Kayapó myths, for instance, do not collapse nature/culture divides.((/ul))Rather, ((ul))the “whole point” is to describe how animals and humans became ((/ul))((ul))fully differentiated((/ul))((ul))from one another((/ul)), with one key twist: ((ul))humanity is defined not as a collection of traits but as the capacity to objectify the process of objectification itself.((/ul))In such ways, ((ul))the attribution of this hyper-real ((/ul))((ul))cosmology ((/ul))((ul))paradoxically reifies((/ul))((ul))the((/ul))((ul))very ((/ul))((ul))terms of the((/ul))((ul))nature/culture ((/ul))((ul))binary it is invoked to disprove.((/ul))At the very least, this means that ((ul))ontological anthropology cannot account for((/ul))those actually ((ul))existing ((/ul))((ul))forms of indigenous worlding that ((/ul))((ul))mimetically ((/ul))((ul))engage modern binaries((/ul))((ul))as ((/ul))((ul))meaningful coordinates((/ul))((ul))for self-fashioning((/ul))(Taussig 1987; Abercrombie 1998).

Only by erasing these conditions could a “non-interiorizable” multinaturalist exteriority be identified. Doesn’t this suggest that ((ul))ontological anthropology is predicated on homogenizing and standardizing the very multiplicity it claims to decolonize((/ul))?

Charged with getting nature wrong, ((ul))modernity is rejected out of hand((/ul))in the ontological turn. ((ul))While the West mistook Nature for an underlying architecture, indigenous people have long realized a more fundamental truth: the natural world is legion and lively.

Attributing the pacification of nature’s vitality to the modern episteme neglects how colonial plantations, industrial farms and factories, national environmental policies, biotechnology companies, and disaster response teams have attempted, in creative and coercive ways, to manage the dispersed agencies of the natural world. ((ul))The ((/ul))((ul))easy dismissal((/ul))((ul))of modernity ((/ul))((ul))as mononaturalism ((/ul))((ul))disregards the ((/ul))((ul))long list of ways((/ul))((ul))that((/ul))((ul))particular ((/ul))((ul))format ((/ul))((ul))never really mattered((/ul))((ul))in((/ul))((ul))the more consequential ((/ul))((ul))makings of our present.((/ul))It is all the more ironic, then, that ontological anthropology uses climate change to spur a conversion away from the epistemic cage of modernity. We would do well to remember that, in the most concrete sense, modernity did not disrupt our planet’s climate, hydrocarbons did. Such fixation on modernity misses the far more complicated and consequential materiality of fossil fuels (Bond 2013). In the momentum they enable and in the toxicity they enact, hydrocarbons naturalize differences in new ways. Such petro-effects amplify existing fault lines not only in industrial cities but also in the premier fieldsites of ontological anthropology: the supposedly pristine hinterlands. In the boreal forests of the northern Alberta or in the upper reaches of the Amazon Basin or in the snowy expanses of the arctic or in the dusty forests of the Gran Chaco, the many afterlives of hydrocarbons are giving rise to contorted landscapes, cancerous bodies, and mutated ecologies. Such problems form a “slow violence” (Nixon 2011) that the spirited naturalism of ontological anthropology cannot register let alone resist. These observations lead us to formulate the following three theses: First, the ontological turn replaces an ethnography of the actual with a sociology of the possible. Second, the ontological turn reifies the wreckage of various histories as the forms of the philosophic present, insofar as it imagines colonial and ethnological legacies as the perfect kind of village for forward thinking philosophy.

Yet((/ul))((ul)), in seeking to elucidate the logic of elimination((/ul))as the overarching historical force guiding settlernative relations ((ul))there is an ((/ul))((ul))operational weakness((/ul))((ul))in the theory, ((/ul))((ul))whereby such((/ul))((ul))a ((/ul))((ul))logic is((/ul))((ul))simply there, ((/ul))((ul))omnipresent((/ul))((ul))and manifest even when((/ul))(and perhaps especially when) ((ul))it appears not to be((/ul)); the settler colonial studies scholar need only read it into a situation or context. ((ul))It((/ul))((ul))thus ((/ul))((ul))hurtles from the ((/ul))((ul))past((/ul))((ul))to the ((/ul))((ul))present((/ul))((ul))into the((/ul))((ul))future((/ul))((ul)), ((/ul))((ul))never to be fully extinguished until the native is((/ul)), or until history itself ends. ((ul))There is thus a powerful ontological((/ul))(if not metaphysical) ((ul))dimension((/ul))to Wolfe’s account, ((ul))where there is((/ul))such thing as ((ul))a ‘settler will’ that inherently desires the elimination of the native and the distinction between the settler and the native can only ever be categorical((/ul)), founded as it is on the ‘primal binarism of the frontier’ (2013a: 258). It is here that the differences between earlier settler colonial scholarship on Israel-Palestine and the recent settler colonial turn come into clearest view. While Jamal Hilal’s (1976) Marxist account of the conflict, for instance, engaged Palestinians and Jewish Israelis in terms of their relations to the means of production, Wolfe’s account brings its own ontology: the bourgeoisie/proletariat distinction becomes that of settler/native, and the class struggle the struggle between settler, who seeks to destroy and replace the native, and native, who can only ever push back. Indeed, ((ul))if the((/ul))((ul))settler colonial ((/ul))((ul))paradigm views history in similar teleological terms((/ul))to the Marxist framework, ((ul))it does not offer the same hopeful vision((/ul))((ul))of a liberated future.((/ul))After all, settler colonialism has only one story to tell – ‘either total victory or total failure’ (Veracini, 2007). Veracini’s attempt to disaggregate different forms of settler decolonization is revealing of the difficulties that come along with this zero-sum perspective. It is significant to note that beyond((ul))settler evacuation (which may decolonize territory((/ul)), he cautions, ((ul))but ((/ul))((ul))not((/ul))((ul))necessarily ((/ul))((ul))relationships((/ul))((ul)))((/ul))the picture he paints is a relatively bleak one. For Veracini (2011: 5), claims for decolonization from indigenous peoples in settler societies can take two broad forms: an ‘anti-colonial rhetoric expressing a demand for indigenous sovereign independence and self-determination ... and an ‘‘ultra’’-colonial one that seeks a reconstituted partnership with the [settler state] and advocates a return to a relatively more respectful middle ground and ‘‘treaty’’ conditions’. While both, he suggests, are tempting strategies in the struggle for change, though ‘ultimately ineffective against settler colonial structures of domination’ (2011: 5), it is the latter strategy that invites Veracini’s most scathing assessment. As he writes, under settler colonial conditions the independent polity is the settler polity and sanctioning the equal rights of indigenous peoples has historically been used as a powerful weapon in the denial of indigenous entitlement and in the enactment of various forms of coercive assimilation. This ((ul))decolonisation actually ((/ul))((ul))enhances((/ul))((ul))the ((/ul))((ul))subjection((/ul))((ul))of indigenous peoples((/ul))((ul))... it is at best irrelevant and at worst detrimental to indigenous peoples in settler societies.((/ul))(2011: 6–7)"],"stats":{"highlightedWords":239}},{"tag":"Combining unlike ontologies better informs political action than singular viewpoints.

As a response to the limits and blindnesses of certain types of rationalist, structuralist, and functional theories, this renewed interest in the ideational is an important advance. Unfortunately, both postmodernism and constructivism have been marked by a strong tendency to go too far in their emphasis of the ideational. ((ul))((hl))Postmodernism((/hl))((/ul)) and constructivism have also ((ul))((hl))helped make theorists((/hl))((/ul)) much more ((ul))((hl))conscious of((/hl))((/ul)) the implicit—and often severely limiting—((ul))((hl))ontological assumptions((/hl))((/ul)) that underlay, inform, and bound their investigations. This is also a major contribution to the study of world politics in all its aspects. Unfortunately, ((ul))((hl))this turn to ontology has((/hl))((/ul)) also had ((ul))((hl))intellectually limiting effects((/hl))((/ul)) by going too far, in the search for a pure or nearly pure social ontology. With the growth in these two approaches, there has indeed been a decided decline in theorizing about the material. But elsewhere in the diverse world of theorizing about IR and the global, theorizing about the material never came anything close to disappearing or being eclipsed. For anyone ((ul))((hl))thinking about the relationships between politics((/hl))((/ul)) and nuclear weapons, space, ((ul))((hl))and the environment((/hl))((/ul)), theorizing about the material has remained at the center, and it would be difficult to even conceive of how theorizing about the material could largely disappear. The recent ‘re-discovery of the material’ associated with various self-styled ‘new materialists’ is a welcome, if belated, re-discovery for postmodernists and constructivists. For most of the rest of us, the material had never been largely dropped out. A very visible example of the ways in which the decline in appropriate attention to the material, an excessive turn to the ideational, and ((ul))((hl))the quest for a nearly pure social ontology, can lead theorizing astray((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))is the core argument in Alexander Wendt’s main book, Social Theory of International Politics, one of the widely recognized landmarks of constructivist IR theory. The first part of the book advances a very carefully wrought and sophisticated argument for a nearly pure ideational social ontology. The material is explicitly displaced into a residue or rump of unimportance. But then, to ((ul))((hl))the((/hl))((/ul)) reader’s surprise, the material, in the form of ‘common fate’ produced by nuclear weapons, and climate change, reappears and is deployed to play a really crucial role in understanding contemporary change in world politics. My ((ul))((hl))solution is((/hl))((/ul)) to employ a ((ul))((hl))mixed ontology((/hl))((/ul)). By this I mean that I think several ontologically incommensurate and very different realities are inescapable parts the human world. ((ul))((hl))These ‘unlikes’((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))are inescapable parts of any argument, and ((ul))((hl))must((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))somehow ((ul))((hl))be combined((/hl))((/ul)). There are a vast number of ways in which they can be combined, and on close examination, virtually all arguments in the social sciences are actually employing some version of a mixed ontology, however implicitly and under-acknowledged. But not all combinations are equally useful in addressing all questions. In my version of mixed ontology—which I call ‘practical naturalism’—human social agency is understood to be occurring ‘between two natures’: on the one hand the largely fixed nature of humans, and on the other the changing nature composed of the material world, a shifting amalgam of actual non-human material nature of geography and ecology, along with human artifacts and infrastructures. Within this frame, I posit as rooted in human biological nature, a set of ‘natural needs,’ most notably for security-from-violence and habitat services. Then I pose questions of functionality, by which I mean: which combinations of material practices, political structures, ideas and identities are needed to achieve these ends in different material contexts? Answering this question requires the formulation of various ‘historical materialist’ propositions, which in turn entails the systematic formulation of typologies and variation in both the practices, structures and ideas, and in material contexts. These arguments are not centered on explaining what has or what will happen. Instead they are practical in the sense that((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))they((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))are attempting to((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))answer the question of ‘what is to be done’((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))given the fixed ends and given changing material contexts. I think this is what advocates of arms control and environmental sustainability are actually doing when they claim that one set of material practices and their attendant political structures, identities and ideas must be replaced with another if basic human needs are to going to continue to be meet in the contemporary planetary material situation created by the globalization of machine civilization on earth. Is it easy to plug your mixed ontology and interests beyond the narrow confines of IR or even the walls of the ivory tower into processes of collective knowledge proliferation in IR—a discipline increasingly characterized by compartimentalization and specialization? The great plurality of approaches in IR today is indispensible and a welcome change. The professionalization of IR and the organization of intellectual life has some corruptions and pitfalls that are best avoided. The explosion of ‘isms’ and of different perspectives has been valuable and necessary in many ways, but it has also helped to foster and empower sectarian tendencies that confound the advance of knowledge. Some of the adherents of some sects and isms boast openly of establishing ‘citation cartels’ to favor themselves and their friends. Some theorists also have an unfortunate tendency to assume that because they have adopted a label that what they actually do is the actually the realization of the label. Thus((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))we have ‘realists’ with limited grasp on realities, ‘critical theorists’ who repeat rather than criticize((/hl))((/ul)) the views of other ‘critical theorists,’ and anti-neoliberals who are ruthless Ayn Rand-like self aggrandizers.

This is not simply to say that reconciliation is an ideal that we should strive towards even though political reality must always fall short of it. As Chantal Mouffe (2000:137) observes, advocates of deliberative democracy tend to present reconciliation in these terms by taking the model of a free, unconstrained communication as a regulative ideal by which to judge and transform actually existing social relations. On this account, the anticipated future of community furnishes an ideal that political reality might approach in an asymptotic relation as we overcome the empirical obstacles that frustrate reconciliation in the present (e.g. Gutmann and Thompson 2000). Similarly, the moral community that is presupposed by the restorative conception of reconciliation is not meant to refer to an actually existing political community but. rather, an idealised image of our social relations by which we make moral sense of our particular dealings with others. Accordingly, we judge the authenticity of attempts at reconciliation in the light of the ideal moral community that they would seek to realise. In contrast, ((ul))an ethic of worldliness suggests not only the empirical improbability of((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))reconciliation but its political impossibility.((/ul)) For, ((ul))although the aspiration to reconciliation enables a reconciliatory politics in the present, its realisation would undercut the conditions that constitute its possibility.

Rather, faith in the possibility of reconciliation and an awareness of the frailty and contingency of the anticipated community establishes a context in which it is possible to confront one’s former antagonist as political adversary.

((ul))Against this tendency to overdetermine the terms within which reconciliation is((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))enacted by hypostatising community as a regulative ideal, we must fall back on politics((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))itself((/ul)).

As such, political reconciliation docs not presuppose a prior community that must be restored between wrongdoers and wronged. While it is animated by the faith that the commonness of the world that lies between adversaries might be revealed through their political interaction, this is recognised as a possibility rather than an inevitability. ((ul))Agreement on moral norms is not required((/ul))((ul)) in order to initiate a process of reconciliation.((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))Rather, political reconciliation presupposes only the ((/ul))((ul))will to live together((/ul))((ul)) in the mode of((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))acting and speaking((/ul)). Although antagonists may disagree radically about the significance and moral meaning of past events for their life in common, they need only acknowledge that they are talking about the same events in order to initiate political reconciliation. ((ul))For((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))the faith of political reconciliation is that, by engaging in an incessant discourse about the((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))world that lies between former enemies, this world might appear more common to them((/ul)). Acknowledging the impossibility of reconciliation suggests further the need to reconsider the sequence of political reconciliation. For, ((ul))if the moral norms by which we ought to order our present social relations cannot be derived from the anticipation of an ideal community, then the ((/ul))((ul))acknowledgement of moral truth cannot be a precondition((/ul))((ul)) for reconciliation. Rather, the anticipation of community conditions the possibility that a shared understanding of the significance of past wrongs will emerge from our political interaction((/ul)). In certain circumstances, as Bert van Rocrmund (2001:179) suggests, 'reconciliation is what makes the revelation of truth possible'. The joint commitment to realising a community that is ‘not yet' establishes a space for politics within which the revelation of truth is possible (but not inevitable). ((ul))Consequently, it is a political mistake to employ our ordinary moral intuitions about((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))the order of reconciliation in the context of a deeply divided polity.

((ul))This space is sustained by a((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))willingness to forgive, which in turn invites those implicated in wrongdoing into political((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))association with those wronged((/ul)). The assumption of political responsibility draws wrongdoers and wronged into a politics of remembrance according to which former antagonists might recognise each other as adversaries. By contesting the significance of the past for their shared association, the commonness of the world might be disclosed. As such, political reconciliation is sustained by the hope that the present will be remembered as the moment in which an anticipated community originated. Yet, it must also be conditioned by an awareness of the risk of politics so that the tendency to overdetermine the terms within which it is enacted can be resisted.

As he states, “((ul))Historians((/ul)) are likely to ((ul))resist the homogenization((/ul))((ul)) into a ((/ul))((ul))single polarity((/ul))((ul)) (modernity/coloniality) of ((/ul))((ul))different types((/ul))((ul)) or ((/ul))((ul))waves((/ul))((ul)) of modernity((/ul)).”42 Salvatore argues that ((ul))no one doubts((/ul))((ul)) that events and structures of power((/ul)) invented in 1492 ((ul))have had ((/ul))((ul))lasting effects((/ul))((ul)) in a region, but “to the extent that these processes have had a ((/ul))((ul))differential impact((/ul))((ul)) upon ((/ul))((ul))distinct regions((/ul))((ul)) and according to ((/ul))((ul))different moments of time((/ul))((ul)), ((/ul))((ul))generalizations((/ul))((ul)) about the persistence of the modern/colonial seem to ((/ul))((ul))erase crucial differences((/ul))((ul)) among ((/ul))((ul))localities((/ul))((ul)) and ((/ul))((ul))periods((/ul)).”43 Thus according to Salvatore from a historical point of view, “((ul))we need to ((/ul))((ul))challenge this homogenization((/ul))((ul)) of a ((/ul))((ul))long-term persistence of the colonial((/ul)).”44 The impact of European colonization was very different in different regions of Mesoamerica. I am not a historian; my concern is rather how ((ul))the tendencies in decolonial thought toward this sort of ((/ul))((ul))historical lumping together((/ul))((ul)) and ((/ul))((ul))linear narratives((/ul))((ul)) about a ((/ul))((ul))single source of evil across history((/ul))((ul)) can result in ((/ul))((ul))oversimplifications((/ul))((ul)) in the ((/ul))((ul))diagnosis((/ul))((ul)) and ((/ul))((ul))proposed solutions((/ul))((ul)) to local evils((/ul)). What is admirable about Villoro is his respect for historical accuracy and complexity when it comes to the relation between ideas, movements, events, and the actual consequences of good and evil. As much as Dussel and Mignolo, Villoro occasionally made overall negative assessments about modernity and liberalism, but he would qualify them and admit that history reveals a much more ambiguous and complex reality on the ground in regard to good and evil. For instance, the relation between the European Enlightment and the actual conditions on the ground in different societies was complex. While in some places it had an antiauthoritarian and liberatory function in regard to certain issues such as religion and dogma, in other times and places it did nothing but support the oppression of certain groups. Villoro acknowledges the same complexity of good and evil in regard to scholasticism, the church, positivism, modernity, the project and ideals of the Mexican and U.S. revolutions, the civil rights movement, and so on. To be clear, ((ul))decolonialists are ((/ul))((ul))correct((/ul))((ul)) that liberalism has been used to ((/ul))((ul))mask oppression((/ul))((ul)) and ((/ul))((ul))white supremacy((/ul))((ul)). They are also ((/ul))((ul))correct((/ul))((ul)) in their rejection of the idea that colonialism and oppression were a ((/ul))((ul))separate((/ul))((ul)) or ((/ul))((ul))just unfortunate side effect((/ul))((ul)) of modernity.

((ul))Activists and academics have increasingly taken up settler colonialism as an analytic to address the particular ways in which colonialism operates((/ul)) and persists in places such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States, as well as Israel/Palestine. To a considerable extent, ((ul))((hl))much of the work that has recently become associated with settler colonial studies has already been underway in Native American and Indigenous studies((/hl))((/ul)), as well as other fields including ethnic studies and colonial discourse studies. ((ul))Our contention is that the particular ways in which settler colonialism has assumed predominance as an analytic risks obscuring or eliding as much as it does to distinguish significant features of the present conjuncture((/ul)).22 Indeed, ((ul))we suggest that when settler colonialism is deployed as a stand-alone analytic it potentially reproduces precisely the effects and enactments of colonial unknowing ((/ul))((ul))that we are theorizing((/ul)) in this introduction. ((ul))Approaches to the analysis of settler colonialism, as isolated from imperialism and differential modes of racialization, are consequences of the institutionalization of this work as a distinct subfield, which is claimed and consolidated through analytic tendencies ((/ul))((ul))that foreclose or bracket out interconnections and relational possibilities((/ul)). ((ul))((hl))Settler colonial((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) histories, conditions, practices, and logics of dispossession and power ((/ul))((ul))((hl))must necessarily be understood as relationally constituted((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) to ((/ul))((ul))other modes of imperialism, racial capitalism, and historical formations of social difference((/ul)). The key insights of ((ul))settler colonial studies((/ul)) into the particularity of settlement as a manner of colonial power ((ul))have((/ul)) also l((ul))ed to a tendency to focus on this distinction as constituting a discrete and modular form or ensemble of practices((/ul))— such as Patrick ((ul))Wolfe’s often cited contention that “((/ul))((ul))settler colonialism destroys to replace((/ul))”23—that can be ((ul))applied across differences of geography or time((/ul)). As such, ((ul))((hl))settler colonialism appears as a self-contained type rather than a situatedly specific formation that is co-constituted with other forms and histories of colonialism, counter-claims, and relations of power((/hl))((/ul)). For instance, i((ul))n the U.S. context, settler colonialism as a singular manner of colonialism ((/ul))((ul))entirely misses the ways in which the abduction and enslavement of Africans and their descendants was a colonial practice that((/ul)), ((ul))while changing in its intensities and modes of organization over time((/ul)), ((ul))was ((/ul))((ul))co-constitutive of colonialism((/ul))((ul)) as a project of settlement rather than a supplement that demonstrates the taking of land and labor as distinct endeavors. Wolfe’s description of ((/ul))((ul))settler colonialism as a structure((/ul)), and ((ul))not an event((/ul)), ((ul))has by now ((/ul))((ul))achieved the status of a truism((/ul))((ul)) in analyses of settler colonialism((/ul)).24 Wolfe’s work has been crucial in bringing further attention to the fact that ((ul))colonialism is an ongoing fact of life for indigenous peoples more than fifty years after the advent of the so-called era of decolonization((/ul)). His scholarship insightfully underscored historical continuities in the shifting regimes and policies of settler states in relation to indigenous peoples, and challenged a certain produced ignorance about the “post” colonial character of societies like the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.25 ((ul))Yet drawing an absolute distinction between structure and event, and as a result, discarding a focus on the historicity of settler colonialism, neglects some of the ways Wolfe distinguishes between the binary terms structure/event in the service of further analysis((/ul)). For example, ((ul))Wolfe emphasizes how settler colonialism is a “complex social formation” with “structural complexity” that emerges through process((/ul)).26 ((ul))When taken up as a modular analytic that travels without regard to the specificities of location or social and material relations, a ((/ul))((ul))categorical event/structure binary banishes deeply engaged historical knowledge((/ul))((ul)) from the ((/ul))((ul))landscape((/ul))((ul)), ((/ul))((ul))turning away from historical materialism((/ul))((ul)), ((/ul))((ul))devolving into a scholastic debate((/ul))((ul)) over ((/ul))((ul))identities and standpoints((/ul))((ul)) that are ((/ul))((ul))reduced to structural essences((/ul))((ul)) and ((/ul))((ul))divorced from politics or contingency((/ul)). ((ul))Emphasizing structure over event also ((/ul))((ul))limits the analysis of settler colonialism((/ul))((ul)) itself into a ((/ul))((ul))descriptive typology((/ul))((ul)), orienting our vision ((/ul))((ul))narrowly within the technical perspective of colonial power((/ul)) (((ul))in the white Commonwealth countries((/ul))), ((ul))away from ((/ul))((ul))geographies from below((/ul)), ((ul))such as a hemispheric perspective of the Americas((/ul)), ((ul))with their multiple and distinct modes of colonialism((/ul)), thus ((ul))replicating the conditions of unknowing((/ul)).((ul))27((/ul))((ul))Foregrounding structure against event might also ((/ul))((ul))divert attention away from imperialism((/ul)). ((ul))This binary perpetuates((/ul)) taking what Lisa Lowe calls ((ul))the “colonial divisions of humanity” as given((/ul)). ((ul))Situating this compartmentalization as a consequence of imperial formations calls attention to how((/ul)), as Lowe writes, “((ul))The operations that pronounce colonial divisions of humanity((/ul))—((ul))settler seizure and native removal((/ul)), ((ul))slavery and racial dispossession((/ul)), and ((ul))racialized expropriations((/ul)) of many kinds—((ul))are imbricated processes((/ul)), ((ul))not sequential events((/ul)); ((ul))they are ongoing and continuous in our contemporary moment((/ul)), ((ul))not temporally distinct((/ul)) now as yet concluded.”28 ((ul))If the analytic project is reduced to naming and delimiting settler colonialism as a distinct structure of power that exists in specific places, primarily the settler peripheries of Anglo imperium, ((/ul))((ul))we lose focus on the Caribbean and the Americas as the grounds of modern imperialism, abdicating the hard-won horizon of anti-imperialism((/ul)). ((ul))An emphasis on structure over event is symptomatic of the stabilization of colonial unknowing through binaries and schematic modes of thought((/ul)). As Wolfe writes, “Territoriality is settler colonialism’s specific, irreducible element.”29However, ((ul))Wolfe’s cartographic model is that of the frontier, in which “the primary social division was encompassed in the relation between natives and invaders((/ul)).”30 ((ul))((hl))The frontier is a linear model((/hl))((/ul))((hl)), ((/hl))((ul))((hl))a binary opposition between civilization and savagery((/hl))((/ul))((hl)), ((/hl))((ul))((hl))reflecting both a colonizing subjectivity and its state form((/hl))((/ul)). ((ul))What socio-spatial imaginaries, and concomitant critical models, might become visible if we thought from other spatial forms, such as circles or spirals, spatial forms that are often more relevant to indigenous epistemologies than straight lines((/ul))? ((ul))If we remapped the colonial condition through circular or spiraling forms, what new insights might we gain on the decolonial imperative? ((/ul))For one, ((ul))we might be able to better grasp colonial, racial, and imperial simultaneities, as well as positions that do not easily fit into a settler/native binary((/ul)). As Wolfe writes, “Settler-colonists came to stay. In the main, they did not send their children back to British schools or retire ‘home’ before old age could spoil the illusion of their superhumanity. National independence did not entail their departure.”31 Moreover, ((ul))to inflect these insights through the lens of negritude produces a considerably more complex set of possibilities, where the verbs come and stay do not carry any simple or easily recoverable trace of agency or consent((/ul)).32 As Iyko Day writes, “((ul))the logic of antiblackness complicates a settler colonial binary framed around a central Indigenous/settler opposition((/ul)).”33 ((ul))It may be useful to ((/ul))((ul))dissolve the implied divide between structure and event((/ul)). ((ul))How would our critical perspective open up if we began to understand (settler) colonialism as a structuring event, an ongoing elaboration of a structure, a suspension of time, tense, and timeliness((/ul))? In order to interrogate settler colonialism as a unique structuring event or events in a structure of power, close attention to process and relationship, to structures of power as they transform in specific places and times, seems to be a useful approach for clarifying the stakes of decolonial possibility. Marx’s insights on the need for capital (and for individual capitalists) to perpetually reproduce the social relations of capitalism (on an expanding scale) and the vulnerable never given-in-advance character of that reproduction, could be relevant for contemplating settler colonialism as it constantly thwarts and undoes its own internal governing logics. ((ul))To consider settler colonialism as a structure of failure seems ((/ul))((ul))a useful starting point for an intellectual project that proceeds from the impulse of decolonization((/ul)).34 ((ul))To bring the critique of imperialism back to the foreground in indigenous-centered critiques of colonialism is to bring back basic questions about the definitions of these terms((/ul)), and ((ul))their relation to each other((/ul)). ((ul))((hl))This is not about discarding analysis of settler colonialism for analysis of imperialism, but instead about entangling them in order to specify historically particular processes and structures((/hl))((/ul)).35 To the extent that a settler colonial analytic disavows relationships between settler and congruent modes of colonization, imperialism, and race, the field formation of settler colonial studies runs a risk of capture, breathing further life into shifting and mutable colonial sovereignty claims."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":109}},{"tag":"Incommensurability can be overcome based on context – their structural framing of settlerism flattens difference amongst indigenous strategies of resistance ","cite":"Snelgrove, University of British Columbia, ‘14","text":["(Corey, Rita Kaur Dhamoon, University of Victoria, and Jeff Corntassel, University of Victoria, “Unsettling settler colonialism: The discourse and politics of settlers, and solidarity with Indigenous nations,” Decolonization: Indigeneity, Education & Society Vol. 3, No. 2, pp. 1-32)","Corey: ((ul))((hl))This relational((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), interdependent ((/ul))((ul))((hl))focus((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) is also important amongst settlers ourselves((/ul)) – perhaps ((ul))as a way to ((/ul))((ul))((hl))counter the ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))flattening of differences((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) that occurs amongst settlers, particularly in solidarity work((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).

Not only does such flattening prevent much needed alliances but flattening itself can actually work to protect certain elements of settler colonialism. For instance, white supremacy works to naturalize white settler presence. In terms of solidarity then, I find it problematic for myself, as a white, class privileged, cis-hetero, and able bodied male (as well as people like me) to demand other peoples to act in solidarity, while also not holding myself (and others like me) responsible and accountable to other forms of violence that may be a contributing factor to the further reification of structures that support settler colonialism, like the State. Now I’m not arguing for the continued eschewal of Indigenous governance and legal orders because others experience violence, but rather, that ((ul))the substantive recognition of Indigenous governance and legal orders also requires a dismantling of other, related forms of domination((/ul)). This latter dismantling I see as necessary but also insufficient for the dismantling of settler colonialism.

((ul))This seems to be something that settlers, white settlers specifically, have yet to articulate and take up, critique and act against((/ul)).

","Jeff: And I think, the more you can make those links, the British occupation of Maori territory is directly related to HBC’s strategy to begin treaty making here… All those things are interrelated. They are shared, and they are seen as shared strategies. The other thing I see is this impulse to delocalize it… it’s always that kind of Free Tibet Syndrome… the further away acts of genocide are from your location, the more outrage expressed at these injustices. It’s a way of avoiding complicity, but it’s also a way of recasting the gaze. It’s like, ‘We’re not going to look right here, because this appears to be fairly peaceful’ And so it’s always that sort of re-directing away from localized responsibility, and almost magnifying impacts farther away.","Rita: So what settler colonial studies does do, is help us relocate to locality, which is helpful. You mention the HBC. I wonder what was the relationship between the Hudson Bay Company in Canada and the East India Company or the East Africa Company? If we’re thinking about settler colonialism as a structure, how is it related to other modalities of gendered and sexualized white supremacy? How are the logics of State sovereignty and authority over nonwhite bodies connected? If we’re thinking about it, as non-Indigenous peoples being ‘in solidarity’, part of that is locating, attacking the whole structure of imperialism that is deeply gendered and homonationalist, that depends on neo-liberal projects of prioritizing able-bodied workers who can serve capitalism.","Corey: ((ul))Part of this, I((/ul)) think, what we’ve been discussing here, ((ul))relates to what I sometimes see as the framing of ‘((/ul))((ul))((hl))settler’ ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))as event, rather than structure((/hl))((/ul)) – ((ul))where we are perhaps overly focused on the question of ((/ul))((ul))‘who’ at the expense of the ‘how’((/ul)).

((ul))So I’m worried that while in one moment the term ‘settler’ denaturalizes our((/ul)) – that is all non-Indigenous peoples – ((ul))presence on Indigenous lands((/ul)), ((ul))in the next, and through this construction of the ‘settler’ as transhistorical, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))we renaturalize it((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).

Here is where I think a historical materialist or genealogical approach to the production of settler subjects may be useful in showing how this production is conditioned by but also contingent on a number of factors – white supremacy, hetero-patriarchy, capitalism, colonization, the eschewal of Indigenous governance and legal orders, environmental degradation, etc. Now ((ul))this is also not to say that the binary of Indigenous/Settler isn’t accurate((/ul)). I think its fundamental. ((ul))Rather, I think it is possible and important to recognize that there have been, and are, individuals((/ul)) (or even collectives) ((ul))that might be referred to as something other than settlers by Indigenous peoples, perhaps as cousins((/ul)). Or in a similar vein, ((ul))that there have been and are practices by settlers ((/ul))((ul))that aren’t colonial ((/ul))((ul))(and here is where centering Indigenous peoples’ accounts of Indigenous-settler relations, as well as their own ((/ul))governance, legal and diplomatic orders is crucial((ul))).

Even prior to the constitution of the field as such, Frantz Fanon, one of its key predecessors, insisted in his typically virulent fashion that \"no conciliation is possible\" in postcolonial societies (Wretched of the Earth 39). ((ul))For Fanon, reconciliation is not only undesirable but((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))also impossible: undesirable in that violence((/ul)), in his view, ((ul))is a purgatory force that((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))releases the colonized from a state of melancholic apathy, and impossible in that((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))once colonialism has officially ended, there would((/ul)), he predicted, ((ul))be no \"interest\"((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))on the part of the colonizers \"in remaining or in co-existing((/ul))\" (Wretched 45).

Inveighing against what she perceives as the field's undue emphasis on consensus and negotiation, Benita Parry, for one, launches a heavy-handed postcolonial critique of reconciliation, which she contends entails a relinquishment of responsibility on the part of the dominant culture and a refusal to remember on the part of the marginalized. In her view, reconciliation is ((ul))necessarily instituted by-((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))as well as in the service of - those who have committed heinous acts, and((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))primarily for the purpose of promoting forgetfulness about the past((/ul)). Referring to what she calls \"the competing demands of reconciliation and remembrance\" (88). Parry interprets the former as the imposition of a historical narrative that elides the invasive and expropriative terms of the imperial enterprise. She ((ul))insists((/ul)), moreover, ((ul))that a project of reconciliation cannot unfold until such time as social((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))and material transformation has already been effected((/ul)). In an age of late capitalism, it is \"premature\" and also \"inequitable\" to advance an agenda of consensus and settlement: \"our best hope for universal emancipation,\" Parry concludes, \"lies in remaining unreconciled to the past and discontented with the present\" (95). ((ul))Yet must a politics of reconciliation necessarily exclude a critique of the contemporary condition?((/ul)) What I want to suggest is that ((ul))((hl))it is ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))precisely because((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) of the prevalence of violence and injustice in the postcolonial era that((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))working towards the possibility of reconciliation constitutes such a profoundly((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))important project((/hl))((/ul)). Whereas Parry thinks that reconciliation prohibits radical social and material change, I argue that ((ul))the conditions of inequality that structure postcolonial societies cannot be altered unless we venture to seriously engage an ethics of reconciliation, unless we strive to realize a time and space beyond violence((/ul)). ((ul))To realize that future it is necessary, certainly, to actively engage with((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))the past, not in order to efface it from memory of course, but for the sake of((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))reprocessing it into something new, of recuperating it as a resource for((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))superseding the injustices of the present((/ul)). In proposing ((ul))an alternative view of reconciliation((/ul)). I want to interrogate, and in some senses ((ul))challenge((/ul)), the ((ul))prevailing meanings and constructions of the((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))term((/ul)). First, I want to acknowledge that the very etymology of the word presents a problem, as it were, for postcolonial analyses of projects of reconciliation. For reconciliation suggests a return to a prior stage, a stage in which there was conciliation; yet for postcolonial societies there can in fact be no return, of course, to some past era of settlement or concord, for such an era never existed in the first place. I employ the concept here, then, more for its convenience as a terminological marker of recent political policies, processes, and movements, and out of an awareness that it renders a problematic temporality. I also employ the concept aware of the dubious aura that surrounds it, that is, ((ul))cognizant that it((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))comes equipped, to the mind of most, with little evocation of contemporary power((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))relations((/ul)). Indeed, in much the same way as \"postcolonial,\" \"reconciliation\" is a theoretically and politically ambiguous term, one that is frequently considered incompatible with a politics of resistance. For in its English usage, the term can signify - particularly if the verb \"reconcile\" is followed by the preposition \"to\" an attitude of resignation, surrender, or submission that precludes the possibility of struggle, antagonism, or opposition. Perhaps this explains the reluctance on the part of many postcolonial critics to concede the possibilities of a politics of reconciliation, since what the term conjures, almost immediately, is the image of oppressed and marginalized communities capitulating to the violent and unjust conditions of contemporary life. In other words, what the phrase \"postcolonial reconciliation\" ((ul))may((/ul)) at once ((ul))seem to imply((/ul)) is ((ul))the worrisome idea that((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))disempowered people ought to acquiescently accept existing dominations,((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))exploitations, and inequalities((/ul)). Of course, the ((ul))suspicion of government policies and practices of((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))reconciliation is well founded given that oftentimes they are devised primarily by((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))state and government officials, without adequate consultation with indigenous((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))groups and grassroots organizations((/ul)). When one considers the program of reconciliation undertaken by the Howard government in Australia, for example, one is forced to admit that the discourse of reconciliation can operate more in the interests of national consolidation and less in those of indigenous compensation. Indeed, it is worth emphasizing that despite their internationalization, ((ul))reconciliation movements are complex and differentiated, with some enabling((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))very little in the way of social and political transformation. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Without denying((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) the((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))political realities that often hinder projects of reconciliation,((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) I wish((/ul)) in this thesis ((ul))to ((/ul))((ul))((hl))maintain a commitment to reconciliation as an ethical ideal((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), and in so doing to((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))put forward another((/ul)) possible ((ul))interpretation((/ul)) of the concept, ((ul))one((/ul)) that is somewhat ((ul))more open((/ul)), I hope, ((ul))to its positive and enabling inflections((/ul)).8  8 In putting forward this definition of reconciliation, I want to register the various meanings of the term when deployed outside of an Anglophone context. While reconciliation is typically associated with resignation, consolation, and compensation in the English language, Michael Hardimon points out that one of the German equivalents of the term, Versöhnung, conveys ((ul))a process of((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))transformation((/ul)): \"When two parties become genuinely versöhnt,\" he explains, \"they do not resume their old relationship unchanged. They become versöhnt by changing their behavior and attitudes in fundamental ways. ((ul))Parties((/ul)) who have attained Versöhnung ((ul))do not have to decide to get along together: their getting((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))along is, instead, the natural result of their being in a new, transformed state((/ul))\" (85). ((ul))I define reconciliation((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))not as the reinforcement or reproduction of colonial or neocolonial relations but ((ul))as((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))the establishment of new conditions of interactions((/ul))-conditions ((ul))centred on the((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))ideals of negotiation, collaboration, and reciprocity((/ul)).9  9 I should note that ((ul))although political projects of reconciliation might((/ul)), given their goals of concord and unity, ((ul))be interpreted by postmodern critics as((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))potentially pernicious attempts to discipline, homogenize, or devalue some other((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))(e.g. race. class. culture, or gender), reconciliation as I conceive ((/ul))((ul))((hl))it((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) here ((/ul))((ul))((hl))is ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))not an((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))attempt to exclude or overcome otherness but rather to overcome the systems of((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))violence which arise in response to categories of otherness((/hl))((/ul)). As I understand it, ((ul))reconciliation involves something somewhat more than merely a \"departure from((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))violence\"((/ul)) (282), which is how John Borneman defines it; ((ul))it involves an entire, yet((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))nevertheless ((/ul))((ul))ongoing and perpetually unfinished, project of completely transforming the brutal and violent conditions that are the legacy of colonialism((/ul)). ((ul))Far from being opposed to resistance, then, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))reconciliation, as a conceptual ideal,((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))entails precisely ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))a radical revision to existing relations of inequality((/hl))((/ul)).10 10 The proliferation of reconciliation processes might be interpreted as a symptom of contemporary political malaise, as if the era of resistance - which many think limited to the 1960s - is now definitely over. In other words, the redirection of political conflicts into processes of reconciliation may be seen as the emergence of a form of politics that places a greater priority on preserving and integrating the nation than on altering the material conditions of oppressed and marginalized groups. Yet ((ul))reconciliation by no means does away with resistance,((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))and in fact, in many cases, marginalized collectivities pursue reconciliation((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))processes as a means of forcing those in positions of power to assume((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))responsibility for the violence of colonization, racism, or sexism((/ul)). A caveat or two is in order: first, reconciliation, properly and practically Speaking, cannot be forced or imposed by those occupying positions of power. Rather it must, if it is to have any efficacy at all, be a consensual process in which the \"work,\" as it were, of reconciling is not assumed only, or even primarily, by those who have been wronged. Furthermore, ((ul))by no means is reconciliation((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))antithetical to the aims of justice((/ul)), although some critics have suggested as much. ((ul))Rather, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))to aspire to and engage in a politics of reconciliation is to strive,((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))relentlessly and indefatigably, to bring about a state of justice such as has never((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))existed before((/hl))((/ul)). ((ul))The notion that the project of reconciliation is fundamentally an((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))exercise in preventing justice is built on the problematic assumption that((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))retributive justice is the form of justice par excellence((/ul)). Thus Mahmood Mamdani, perhaps the TRC's most vociferous critic, is operating, I suggest, from a narrow and ultimately unimaginative concept of justice when he contends that reconciliation diminishes justice: \"To reconcile is to restore,\" Mamdani announces, \"to return to a status quo ante\" (\"Reconciliation without Justice,\" 182).11 In a recent collection of essays entitled The Burden of Memory, The Muse of Forgiveness, Wole Soyinka launches a similar - and, in my view, similarly limited - attack on frameworks of justice that prioritize reconciliation. Casting doubt on the capacity of truth telling procedures to benefit victims, Soyinka proclaims that, \"the problem with the South African choice is its implicit, a priori exclusion of criminality, and thus responsibility,\" The TRC's refusal to perform \"the rites of vengeance,\" as he calls it, is, according to Soyinka, a fundamental oversight, ((ul))for punishing perpetrators would((/ul)), he assumes, ((ul))provide a \"sense of((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))closure\" or a form of \"catharsis\" to victims by pressing the wrongdoers \"into((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))service in a reversal of roles\"((/ul)) (33). To this claim, I would ask: ((ul))is it possible for((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))the crimes committed by the perpetrators((/ul)) of apartheid ((ul))to be accurately recorded((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))and tallied up to create a sum total of meanings?((/ul)) ((ul))And does reckoning with((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))violence through retribution necessarily restore to victims that which has been((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))lost?((/ul)) ((ul))If survivors opt not to punish their perpetrators, does that then mean that((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))they are essentially ignorant or careless of the ramifications of their decision?((/ul)) What I wish to suggest, by way of response, is that although they may disconcert or stupefy those of us situated in post modern contexts, ((ul))the rhetoric and((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))rituals that structure reconciliation processes may be crucial to a departure from((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))colonialist and racist relations, and to the commencement of a new, more((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))equitable, future((/ul)). Indeed, it is a central premise of mine that ((ul))paradigms and((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))practices of reconciliation may, despite their defiance of dominant juridical((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))categories, constitute important, albeit hitherto discounted, alternatives to modern((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))conceptualizations of justice((/ul)). In arguing for a consideration of the possibilities of reconciliation that acknowledges the validity of indigenous notions of justice, I am following the provocative lead of Rosemary Jolly, whose advocacy of the TRC takes the form of ((ul))acknowledging and affirming the terms of resistance((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))selected by marginalized communities((/ul)). Questioning the assumption of many postmodern critics that the TRC's invocation of Christian rituals of confession constitutes a colonialist imposition, Jolly observes that \"Our familiarity and comfort with modern judicial rituals can leave us uncomfortable with rituals that defy the secular claims of modernity\" (696). This uneasiness with models of justice that do not conform to a secular, rationalist framework is problematic to the extent that it tends to reinscribe a Western developmentalist narrative that casts South Africa as irrational and backward. Jolly explains: The Western press's predominant dismissal of the TRC may appear to emerge from a sense of concern for the denial of human rights in those countries of the world considered to be undemocratic by Western European and North American standards. Acceptance of this appearance rests on the notion that the industrial or postindustrial countries of the West have the knowledge and right to export their particular notion of the subject and her or his rights as part and parcel of the benefits of the processes of globalization. (698) Jolly's comments me a salutary reminder that ((ul))we need to be particularly vigilant((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))about the problems of dismissing reconciliation processes out of hand, for what((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))may lurk in our apparent concern that \"justice be done\" is the unspoken belief that((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))the civilized West has the exclusive rights to the definition of justice and its((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))modes of operation((/ul)).12 ((ul))There are serious dangers, then, to viewing only those((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))models of justice authorized by secular modernity as legitimate and authoritative((/ul)). In this thesis, ((ul))I take seriously those dangers, offering a sustained consideration of((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))the possibilities of those reconciliatory models that ((/ul))((ul))enable marginalized communities to be their own agents of change((/ul))((ul)), and subjecting the notion that((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))retributive justice is the only solvent to postcolonial crimes to rigorous scrutiny((/ul)). ((ul))In asking for a critical reevaluation of the politics of reconciliation, I am((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))calling deeply into question the commonly held view that ((/ul))((ul))justice is reducible to the punishment of evil((/ul)). ((ul))Reckoning legally with violence through retribution is((/ul)), I propose, ((ul))not the only possible, nor even always the most viable, form of response((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))to the infliction of racial and (post)colonial injuries((/ul)). ((ul))While some have argued that((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))retributive justice is an important precondition to reconciliation that vindicates((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))victims through a kind of quid-pro-quo settling of accounts((/ul)), I suggest that ((ul))this((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))assessment not only discounts the views of those victims who decide not to((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))pursue criminal and civil remedies but also a priori assumes that legal accounting((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))can recuperate the losses suffered by survivors((/ul)). With Pal Ahluwalia, I propose that ((ul))reconciliation offers a potential alternative to the cycle of revenge that((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))characterizes many postcolonial societies((/ul)), and I ask how postcolonial theory might be developed in the interests of reconciliation. While he does not consider the implications of his proposal for the notion of forgiveness, Ahluwalia suggests that ((ul))the attendant cycle of revenge and counter-revenge might be broken through((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))the gift((/ul)), and makes the argument that ((ul))postcolonialism is instructive for examining((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))processes of reconciliation, as it attempts to reimagine the past and the present((/ul)). ((ul))Pointing to such prominent African leaders as Nelson Mandela and Jomo((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))Kenyatta((/ul)), he ((ul))focuses on the possibilities they symbolize for national((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))reimagination and reconstruction((/ul)): \"((ul))They emerge from prison((/ul)),\" he observes, \"((ul))not((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))with a sense of revenge, but with the intention to break the cycle of revenge((/ul))\" (\\98). But as much as \"founding fathers,\" as Ahluwalia calls them, are important for the symbolic import they lend reconciliation movements, grassroots organizations are possibly even more important, to the extent that they create the conditions for reconciliation at the local level. Without the initiatives of the Aborginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) in Australia, for Example, or the various community-based organizations in the north and south of Sri Lanka, reconciliation would not even be a possibilty. ((ul))In turning to the concept of reconciliation in the hopes of moving beyond((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))violence and hostility, these((/ul)) organizations ((ul))emphasize that no compensation can((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))ever adequately redress wrongs, and that the losses suffered by victims can never((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))be fully recovered. A complete recuperation is impossible no matter what route to((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))justice is sought((/ul)). That said, ((ul))in relinquishing((/ul)) the right to resort to the rule of law, ((ul))victims may not be passively authorizing or assenting to their oppression: rather((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))their decision may well arise out of((/ul)), for example, a perception of the stakes involved in the consolidation of democracy, or out of ((ul))an attempt to create a new((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))start by breaking a cycle of rebounding violence((/ul)). Let me propose, then, that ((ul))to((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))subscribe to a politics of reconciliation - to opt not to endorse principles of((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))punishment or retribution - is perhaps to place one's wager on the future, to take((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))up the challenge of beginning anew without denying an ongoing sense of loss((/ul)). This task is paradoxical by definition, for ((ul))it involves creating an end that one((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))knows to be fundamentally fictional in character((/ul)) (Borneman 284). Certainly my own analysis of reconciliation is characterized by an unceasing awareness that the vision underlying it may seem Janus-faced in that it assumes both the prevalence of power relations and the possibility of their reconstitution. But this tension may be a crucial condition, after all, of any vision of reconciliation that confronts the challenge of the project: to make possible the impossible; to recuperate losses that are fundamentally irrecoupable. In attempting this challenge, I bear in mind throughout this study that ((ul))for((/ul)) victims ((ul))[survivors] of colonialist and racist violence, there can ultimately be no complete((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))recovery((/ul))((ul)), no absolute resolution of loss((/ul)).13 ((ul))While those victims who opt to((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))reconcile with their wrongdoers may, as a result, be able to reclaim a sense of((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))selfhood and dignity, the ((/ul))((ul))loss((/ul))((ul)) that they have suffered - whether it derives from, say, the ((/ul))((ul))death((/ul))((ul)) of loved ones, or from the ((/ul))((ul))damage inflicted on their own psyche((/ul))((ul)) - ((/ul))((ul))obstinately((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))remains((/ul)). ((ul))Because traumatic loss is experienced repeatedly and((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))retrospectively((/ul)), as Cathy Caruth has famously noted, ((ul))complete recovery can only((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))be worked toward, never definitively achieved((/ul)). Because, in other words, the traumatic event or some aspect thereof is not registered at the actual time of occurrence, and is never fully apprehended by the victim, ((ul))reconciliation can never((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))happen \"once and for all\" but only as the perpetually deferred outcome of a long((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))mourning process((/ul)). ((ul))Reconciliation may inaugurate the task of mourning but that((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))task is never quite finished((/ul)), never completely fulfilled: oddly, a recovery that might be a reconciliation only becomes possible, as John Borneman has suggested, through the relentless mourning of loss (284). Another way of saying this is that victims of postcolonial trauma are perpetually beset by a melancholia that might be alleviated, but certainly not stopped or defeated, through acts of memory and narration. The endlessness of mourning must, I think, be kept constantly in mind, else we risk assuming, as Paul Ricoeur has, that mourning has reconciliation as its teleological end. Drawing on Freud's famous distinction between melancholia and mourning, Ricoeur suggests that whereas melancholia forecloses the possibility of reconciliation, mourning is, in fact, tantamount to reconciliation. 14 Melancholia, he writes, consists of \"a longing to be reconciled with the loved object which is lost without hope of reconciliation,\" while \"mourning,\" by contrast, \"is a reconciliation:' a process that results in the recuperation of loss (\"Memory\" 7). In assuming that it offers the victim the possibility of a normalizing closure, a definitive end to melancholic grief and ambivalence, Ricoeur forgets the paradoxical character of mourning and, subsequently, of reconciliation. Is not mourning, if nothing else, a process of striving towards, yet never entirely realizing, reconciliation with the lost other? ((ul))It is only through((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))relentless mourning that the promise of release from suffering and recuperation of((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))the other emerges((/ul)), as Derrida, in his reflections on the impossibility of reconciliation, suggests. Derrida challenges the myth of reconciliation between the mourner and her lost object by insisting on the interminability of the mourning process. Questioning the successful, introjective mourning prescribed by Freud, he reflects on the ethical difficulties posed by the discourse of \"self-restoration,\" and speculates that \"the most distressing, or even the most deadly infidelity\" might be that \"of a possible mourning\" (Memoires 6). Calling for an impossible mourning, he further suggests that ((ul))the promise of reconciling with the other is((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))what gives mourning a chance. ((/ul))((ul))It is this hope of reconciliation that mourning((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))offers, as well as the dream of forgiveness((/ul)) of which Derrida also writes, ((ul))that((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))should propel us((/ul)), I believe, ((ul))to engage in the difficult work of imagining a different((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))future, an alternative to the violences of colonialism, racism, and sexism((/ul))."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":118}},{"tag":"Refusal’s insufficient to accomplish the scope of material decolonization or resolve their impacts","cite":"Anna Frances Laing 15, Glasgow geography PhD candidate, “Territory, resistance and struggles for the plurinational state: the spatial politics of the TIPNIS Conflict,” http://theses.gla.ac.uk/5974/7/2015laingphd.pdf)","text":["The use of indigeneity as a common signifier has fostered mobilisation across different ethnic groups. This process has been aided by NGOs and técnicos (technical experts) that accompanied the Eighth and Ninth Marches. NGO representatives facilitated meetings, provided training, funded activities and constructed written announcements and texts. These mediatory actors therefore helped to re-articulate the grievances of the marchers under the banner of indigenous rights. This could be seen in the writing of open letters to the government during both the Eighth and Ninth Marches, made possible through the aid of technical experts from one of the principle legal organisations defending indigenous rights in Bolivia CEJIS (Centro de Estudios Jurídicos e Investigación Social; Centre of Legal Studies and Social Investigation). Therefore, ((ul))in order to ‘speak’ and be heard, the indigenous peoples have to undergo a process of representation through the language of legal rights. They therefore remain ‘subaltern’ because their attempts at self-representation fall outside the ‘the lines laid down by the official institutional structures of representation’((/ul)) (Spivak 1996: 306). Thus, Glenn (2011) contends that the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples is ((ul))ironic since it seeks the recognition of alternative epistemologies through civic institutions that have homogenising and universalising tendencies. However((/ul)), as Fabricant notes in her work with the Landless Peasants Movement in Bolivia, movements ‘take NGO ideas and meld them with their own creative strategies to come up with solutions that will work for their communities’ (2012: 120).

This acts to disembody the identity claims from some of the more radical tangents of the movement.

Strategic Anti-Essentialism: Decolonizing Decolonization,” in Sylvia Wynter: On Being Human as Praxis, 168-177","text":["Wynter’s insistence that an examination of people’s modes of subjective understanding tells us something very useful about how to end practices of colonization, specifically her understanding of humans as being “hybridly” organic and “languaging” life forms. All humans, she argues, have “culturespecific system[s] of symbolic representation,” which alone influence our “modes of conspecificity.”14 It “is on the basis of that mode [of subjective understanding],” she adds, “that the subjects of each human order are enabled to experience themselves as symbolic kin or interaltruistic conspecifics.”15 ((ul))((hl))Particularistic modes of essentialist subjective understandings inherently create a limited sense of conspecificity, one that continuously creates the conditions for the subjugation of others((/hl))((/ul))((hl)). ((/hl))((ul))((hl))This is because any particularistic propter nos is practically “impervious to philosophical attack” and “impervious also to ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))empirical counterevidence((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).”((/ul))16 ((ul))Hence, those within it are often unable to see the shared humanity of those imagined as outsiders((/ul)). Therefore, Wynter proposes that “the central mechanism at work” in processes of colonization—and even decolonization—“was and is that of representation.”17 It is through strategies of representation “that each human order and its culture- specific mode of empirical reality can be brought into being as a ‘form of life’.”18 And, importantly, who we think we are—be it “Spanish” or “European” or “Aztec” or native—and who our co- specifics are (those with / for whom we feel we have a connection) has significant effects on our actions. Wynter shows, for example, how the “Spanish” conquistadores were as incapable of imagining the “Aztecs” as their co- specifics as the “Aztecs” were in their view of other groups in (what is now) Mexico. The actions of both the Spanish and the Aztecs were limited by their partial, subjective understanding of themselves. ((ul))The problem of partial perspectives on being human((/ul))((ul)), then, is one that is ((/ul))((ul))shared across the line of colonizer / colonized((/ul)). Hence, Wynter calls for another root expansion in thought, one that can imagine the propter nos as one encompassing all humans as a species. This possibility exists not in the abstract but in the acknowledgment that human beings are deeply interconnected with one another and with the environment of which we are a part (although, unfortunately, Wynter’s call does not extend to nonhuman life).19 This connectivity remains real even as the groups and territories we are said to belong to are ideologically rendered as being particularistic (e.g., the United States as a “white” space) or as our connections to each other across spaces are denied (e.g., we are “American”). Indeed, ((ul))as a result of the global expansion of ruling relations((/ul))((ul))((hl)), life((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) on the planet ((/ul))((ul))((hl))and((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) thus ((/ul))((ul))((hl))our((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) diverse ((/ul))((ul))((hl))planetary lives((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) and ties ((/ul))((ul))((hl))are((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) perhaps more ((/ul))((ul))((hl))connected to each other((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) than ever before((/ul))((ul)). This, along with the threat of ((/ul))((ul))nuclear destruction((/ul))((ul)) hanging over all of our heads for the last sixty- odd years, shows us that our ((/ul))((ul))futures are also intimately related((/ul)). ((ul))It is the reality of these connections and our shared need to secure the conditions of continued life that may((/ul)), Wynter argues, ((ul))make it possible for us to accept each other in toto, as a truly co-identified species((/ul)). In Wynter’s proposed “human view” of 1492, the possibility of aligning our subjective understanding of ourselves with our social reality of interconnectivity is ours, if we want it. If the opportunity to do so is taken, we may be able to win, Wynter argues, the “true victory” promised by past expansions in our understanding of our co- humanity that remain incomplete.20 To do so, we both need to transform the systems of symbolic representations we use and make an equally transformative change in our relationships to each other, relationships that, today, continue to hierarchically value people so that our ability to live a healthy, peaceful, and dignified life remains as unequal as the terms of the initial Columbian exchange.21 I turn now to an examination of attempts at expanding our imagination of propter nos as well as current attempts to narrow it. This, I believe will help us clarify the political choices that we currently face and which are ours to make. Subjected: Autochthony and Its Others ((ul))The ((/ul))((ul))very real possibility((/ul))((ul)) of thinking and acting outside the limits of any specific culture’s self- understanding by expanding people’s sense of nos is ((/ul))((ul))evident in countless attempts over the past five hundred years((/ul))((ul)) to broaden the circle of those with whom we hold ((/ul))((ul))affective ties((/ul)). ((ul))Significantly, this is a process that has been ((/ul))((ul))engaged in both by dominant groups and by those they rule over((/ul)). To use an example given by Wynter, while the Aztecs in the early sixteenth century were unable to imagine others living in what is now “Mexico” as their co- specifics—and thereby enabling Hernán Cortés to successfully ally himself with other groups to destroy the Aztecs—there now exists a subjective understanding of being “indigenous.” ((ul))Emerging in the post–World War II era, indigeneity is a relatively recent mode of representation, one that encompasses very diverse people across the Americas, indeed across the world, often under a single, shared subjective understanding of being the “first” to live in any particular place((/ul)).22 Being indigenous is ((ul))a form of co- identification among people who previously did not see any connection with one another((/ul)). It is ((ul))also a way of laying claim to particular lands((/ul)) (or, more accurately, territories) ((ul))on the basis of having (or having once had) specialized knowledge of that place. Yet, this mode of representation, however new or potentially expansive, remains particularistic((/ul)). ((ul))Indigeneity is a form of subjectivity that emerged because of the devastation wrought in the aftermath of 1492((/ul)). Moreover, it is a form of subjectivity that interpellates people into efforts to gain national sovereignty within the global system of national states. ((ul))((hl))Indigenous, then, ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))as a mode of representation includes((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) the often ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))unacknowledged elision((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) between ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))native as a colonial state category of subjugation((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) and ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))indigenous as a category of resistance((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). Indigenous ((/ul))((ul))conceptualized as such((/ul))((ul)) retains two interrelated problems that ((/ul))((ul))ensure that the kinds of unequal relationships organized in the aftermath of 1492 are reproduced((/ul))((ul)). First, by ((/ul))((ul))denying((/ul))((ul)) the ((/ul))((ul))social constitution((/ul))((ul)) of the category of indigenous, it disavows people’s now- long ((/ul))((ul))history of connectivity across (and sometimes against) this category((/ul))((ul)). Because this connectivity challenges the particularistic nature of indigeneity, ((/ul))((ul))recognition of interrelationality is itself represented as a threat((/ul))((ul)). Second, by continuing to ((/ul))((ul))limit the criteria of membership((/ul))((ul)) of each nos, each is ((/ul))((ul))unable to accept as co-specifics those who are rendered as always-already oppositional others((/ul))((ul)). Indeed, in making any particularistic nos, the significance of omitting certain others cannot be underestimated. The category of indigenous, thus, does a sort of political work. It ((/ul))((ul))produces a particular nos((/ul))((ul)) (and thus a particular Other- to- indigenous nos)((/ul)).23 For some (though certainly not all) of those currently constituted as indigenous, it seems that one of the consequences of the enormously uneven Columbian exchange is the denunciation of the process of exchange itself. Today, the movement of life, plants, humans, and other animals is often cited as the cause for the devastation wrought on their native equivalent.24 Rather than focus on the hierarchical and exploitative relations of the Columbian exchange, some assume that the cause of the problem was / is mobility itself. ((ul))Within such a worldview, that which moves is consequently denounced as inherently polluting, and, in an idiom that is gaining in popularity, movement and ((/ul))((ul))migration((/ul))((ul)) are posited as ((/ul))((ul))inherently colonizing((/ul))((ul)). An understanding of mobility as always colonizing is ((/ul))((ul))evident in the expansion of the term “settler colonist” to include all those deemed nonnative((/ul))((ul)) in any given space((/ul)). ((ul))Recently, within both indigenous studies and social movements for indigenous rights, the historical distinctions between the voyages of Columbus (and other colonizers) and those of slaves who survived the Middle Passage, indentured workers recruited in the wake of slavery’s abolition, and present- day migrants captured in a variety of state categories ranging from illegal to immigrant, have been collapsed. All, it is claimed, are agents of colonialism((/ul)). It seems, then, that as there has been an expansion in the subjective understanding of people as indigenous, there has been a subsequent expansion in their other. Put differently, ((ul))((hl))within some indigenous systems of belonging, ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))all past and present people constituted as migrants are situated as colonizers((/hl))((/ul)). In our present “great age” of migration, how did “colonizer” become a meaningful way to describe people who move across space?25 Indeed, how did “colonizer” come to be an increasingly dominant mode of representing indigenous people’s others, others who were once understood as cocolonized people or, at least, not as an oppositional other? Is there a relationship between these particularistic modes of representation and the false separation and hierarchical ranking of different but related experiences of colonization, such as the processes of expropriation and people’s displacement across space? The answers to these questions lie within the logics of autochthonous systems of representation and the ways in which claims to indigeneity bring to life discourses of alienness or foreignness. Jean Comaroff and John Comaroff argue, by “elevating to a first- principle the ineffable interests and connections, at once material and moral, that flow from ‘native’ rootedness, and special rights, in a place of birth,” autochthonous discourses place those constituted as natives at the top of a hierarchy of the exploited, oppressed, and colonized and insist on the centrality of the claims of natives for the realization of either decolonization or justice.26 ((ul))Within the negative duality of natives and nonnatives that such discourses put into play, origins((/ul)) (and, in some contexts, claims of original, versus later, human discovery or inhabitation) ((ul))become the key determinant of who belongs in any given space today—and who does not((/ul)). ((ul))The quintessential alien or foreigner within autochthonous discourses is the figure of the migrant((/ul)). This is because the hegemonic understanding of what it means to be a migrant in today’s world is one where migration is seen as movement away from one’s native land. Thus, migrants come to stand as the ultimate nonnative. Such a move works to shift the focus from a dialectics of colonialism—where the key historical dynamic is one of expropriation and exploitation, and the key relationship is one between the colonizers and the colonized—to one where ((ul))the ((/ul))((ul))dichotomy between native and nonnative becomes central to both analysis and politics((/ul))((ul)). Patrick ((/ul))((ul))Wolfe((/ul)), a historian of Australia, ((ul))captures this perspective well in his claim that “the fundamental social divide is not the color line. It is not ethnicity, minority status, or even class. The primary line is the one distinguishing Natives from settlers—that is, from everyone else((/ul)). Only the Native is not a settler. Only the Native is truly local. Only the Native will free the Native. One is either native or not.”27 From such an autochthonous perspective, being native is both spatially and temporally dependent. ((ul))Temporally, migrants may be identified as natives at some point in time and in some given space, but once having moved away from the spaces where such representations may be claimed, they become nonnatives. Spatially, migrants remain native but only to the places they no longer live in((/ul)). ((ul))Thus, some argue that migrants can continue to claim native rights to places they have moved from if they are able to show genealogical descendance from those with native status in that space((/ul)).28 Candace Fujikane, in dismissing Asian claims to belong in the United States, puts it this way: “Indigenous people are differentiated from settlers by their genealogical, familial relationship with specific land bases that are ancestors to them. One is either indigenous to a particular land base or one is not. Asian Americans are undeniably settlers in the United States because we cannot claim any genealogy to the land we occupy, no matter how many lifetimes Asian settlers work on the land, or how many Asian immigrants have been killed through racist persecution and hate crimes, or how brutal the political or colonial regimes that occasioned Asians’ exodus from their homelands.”29 ((ul))In this logic, ((/ul))((ul))indigeneity is racialized / ethnicized((/ul))((ul)), and in the process, ((/ul))((ul))land((/ul))((ul))—or more accurately, territory—is ((/ul))((ul))as well((/ul))((ul)). Natives, it is assumed, belong in “their” native land and only there. Further, ((/ul))((ul))who can be recognized as native is dependent upon ancestry((/ul))((ul)), thereby ((/ul))((ul))adding blood to the discourse of soil((/ul)). Descent becomes of further importance in this distinction, for many indigenous people are, of course, also Asian (and European and African and so on) as well as vice versa. It is one’s ability to claim some indigenous ancestor that can allow one to be seen as indigenous today. ((ul))While such claims can be social and not biological, many indigenous groups, following from certain governments’ own categorical recognition of indigeneity, rely on some form of ((/ul))((ul))blood quantum((/ul))((ul)) rule that requires a minimal indigenous lineage. Not surprisingly, such ((/ul))((ul))criteria for belonging((/ul))((ul)) (and for the rights and entitlements of membership) have ((/ul))((ul))not always worked for those subordinated through other axes of oppression((/ul))((ul)) and exploitation. Thus, ((/ul))((ul))many women have found that their claims to native status are often the first to be discounted((/ul)).30 ((ul))In this, there is an ((/ul))((ul))ironic historical continuity((/ul))((ul)) of autochthonous ideas and practices of belonging and the ((/ul))((ul))underlying logics of the colonial((/ul))((ul)) (and, in some places, postcolonial) ((/ul))((ul))state((/ul)). Indeed, the meaning of native was one that was used to distinguish the colonized from the colonizer so that the natives could be represented as less human and, therefore, as legitimately colonized. Being native, then, was a signifier of being colonized and the ultimate signifier of abjectness. Nativeness as a mode of representation, then, was designed to institutionalize the new racist orders implemented by different colonial empires. Importantly, all colonized people were variously identified as “the” natives in order to signal their lack of membership in the propter nos of the colonizers.31 In the post–World War II era of postcolonialism, when, through much struggle, colonial empires were removed from the list of legitimate forms of political rule, the right to claim rights within and to any given space came, increasingly, to be seen as belonging to “the” natives. After all, we were told, the anticolonial project was often posited as fighting for the rule of the natives for the natives. Not surprisingly, then, the battle over resources and over place has, thus, increasingly become one about the meaning of nativeness. ((ul))In this way, autochthonous modes of belonging are significant in advancing particular nationalized regimes of rights, for the national subject is often defined through an exclusive racialized / ethnicized criteria through which political rights and rights to property, especially social property rights in land and natural resources, are to be apportioned within any claimed national space. Contemporary, postcolonial forms of racism are often based on ideas of autochthony((/ul)). All those who are said to have migrated to the places where they live (or who cannot prove their prior inhabitance) are increasingly viewed as agents of (instead of co- victims of) colonial projects. ((ul))The ruling ideology of nationalism has provided an explanation for belonging and has come to be a key way to distinguish between who is properly native to any given place and who is not. Today, the rhetoric of autochthony is evident throughout the world, including diverse sites in Europe, southern Africa, Central Africa, Latin America, North America, and the Pacific. Significantly, such a discourse spans the political spectrum from the Right to the Left((/ul)). Here, I focus on the emergence of autochthonous discourses in indigenous nationalist politics (engaged in by both natives and nonnatives) in the territories claimed by Canada and the United States, with a particular focus on the Hawaiian archipelago, where this discourse is well rehearsed. ((ul))The position that all migrants are settler colonists has been advanced in a number of recent scholarly works in((/ul)) Canada and ((ul))the U((/ul))nited ((ul))S((/ul))tates. In the context of Hawai’i, it has been argued that “Asians” in Hawai’i (most of whom are the descendants of contractually indentured plantation laborers who began arriving in the mid- 1800s) are “settler colonists,” active in the colonization of native Hawaiians due to their nonnative status.32 The main distinction between the two groups, they argue, is that native Hawaiian claims are based on rights of national sovereignty over “their land, water, and other economic and legal rights,” while Asians, because they are not native, have no right to make such claims.33 In a Canadian context, Bonita Lawrence’s and Enakshi Dua’s article “Decolonizing Antiracism” (2005) in Social Justice makes some of the same arguments made by the contributors to the special issue of Amerasia Journal on “Asian Settler Colonialism in Hawai’i.”34 Like them, Lawrence and Dua also focus on those nonnatives who are nonwhite. They contend that the antiracist praxis of nonwhites has “contribute[d] to the active colonization of Aboriginal peoples.”35 Indeed, they contend that “antiracism is premised on an ongoing colonial project” and on “a colonizing social formation.”36 Postcolonial critiques of national liberation strategies, social constructivist critiques of the naturalness of races or nations, and arguments against ethnic absolutism, such as those made by Stuart Hall, become, for them, examples of how antiracism is a colonial practice.37 Lawrence and Dua maintain that these kinds of analyses colonize indigenous people by “contribut[ing] to the ongoing delegitimization of Indigenous nationhood.”38 ((ul))In these essays((/ul)), then, ((ul))critiques of nationalisms or of the naturalization of social categories are tantamount to attacks against indigenous people. It is in such assertions that we can find the ideological character of autochthonous discourses. In arguing for the theoretical and political centrality of nativeness, there is an effort to depoliticize native nationalisms. ((/ul))((ul))By insisting that any critique of nationalism is tantamount to a colonial practice, the nationalist assumptions and politics of native nationalisms are taken out of the realm of that which can be contested((/ul))((ul)). Consequently, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))native nationalisms are posited as the only strategy for decolonization((/hl))((/ul)). ((ul))It is precisely the nationalism inherent within autochthonous discourses that helps to ((/ul))((ul))explain not only why all nonnatives are conceptualized as colonizers but also why((/ul))((ul)) the (varied) critics of nationalism (or those who argue for the social basis for ideas of race and ethnic purity, or ((/ul))((ul))those who uncover a politics of solidarity across such lines) are also colonizers((/ul)). Negatively racialized persons, in this logic of nationalized self- determinacy, are relegated to being mere minorities of various nations and their existing or hoped- for national sovereign states. Thus, because they are not a people / nation as defined by hegemonic doctrines of self- determinancy, Asians, for example, in Hawai’i, or elsewhere in the United States and Canada, are represented as not- colonized and, therefore, in the dualistic mode of autochthonous representations, as colonizers. Within autochthonous discourses one can only be colonized if they “belong” or are indigeneous to that space itself. In this view, the colonization that people experience supposedly ends once one moves away from the colony (or, now, the postcolony). Instead, these migrants come to be represented as colonizers. ((ul))Because a key aspect of the subjective understanding of indigenous is being a colonized person, only other colonized persons can be seen to be co- specifics. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Neither those constituted as migrants nor their struggles can be perceived as part of anticolonial struggles. As such, they cannot be included as ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))commensurate ((/ul))((ul))((hl))human ((/hl))((/ul))being((ul))((hl))s within any colonial or postcolonial space((/hl))((/ul)). This view imagines the space of colonialism as finite. It fails to see the broader field of power that processes of colonialism opened up. More specifically, it fails to see migration as a part of the colonial experience. The world as seen through an autochthonous lens is one of discrete, disconnected spaces, each belonging to its native people. This is the autochthonous view of the world prior to colonization and of the ideal decolonized space. ((ul))It thus appears that ((/ul))((ul))as borders and relationships begin to realign to allow for new forms of subjective understanding and conspecificity, some scholars and activists are actively working to re-fix borders and territories through particularistic strategies of identification((/ul))((ul)). The new ((/ul))((ul))mode of representation of indigeneity, which, ostensibly, appears to be an expansion in subjective understanding, creates a Manichaean dualism of native and nonnative((/ul))((ul)). Such a logics of representation ((/ul))((ul))assumes that all past and present processes of exchange are inherently destructive((/ul)). Colonialism, from such a view, was (and remains) about people moving about and that it was / is in this process of moving away from where they are native to places where they are not that has caused the enormous destruction of life. ((ul))By casting all human mobility as colonial acts, autochthonous modes of representation, ironically, ((/ul))((ul))empty out from the meaning of colonialism the enormous violence that has been done by colonizers. It also minimalizes—or even denies—the violence done to people who moved and who move today((/ul)). ((ul))Borders, including the borders between natives and nonnatives, although seemingly about the physical separation of those in the national nos from its foreign others, then, are primarily concerned with ((/ul))((ul))making differences within the same space that the nos and its others both live in((/ul))((ul)). Because we—and, with Sylvia Wynter, I use “we” in all the fullness of the term “humans”—have long lived in a world that is connected across nowdemarcated spaces, making claims to land, to livelihoods, and to belonging on the basis of particularistic claims, such as a racialized national membership, ((/ul))((ul))only works to ensure that the oppressions and exploitations wrought in the aftermath of 1492 are maintained, albeit in new guises((/ul))."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":140}},{"tag":"Restricting immigration is central to the settler colonial project – precluding repeal produces anti-migrant violence","cite":"Soma Chatterjee 18, York political science professor, “Immigration, anti-racism, and Indigenous selfdetermination: towards a comprehensive analysis of the contemporary settler colonial,” Social Identities, Taylor and Francis","text":["Introduction ((ul))Without suggesting that Indigenous peoples and immigrants should or can make ‘natural’ allies, we do not accept that there is anything natural about the separation of these issues; they are being actively driven apart, and the resulting separation is constitutive of the racialized colonialist((/ul)) Canadian ((ul))state((/ul)). (Stanley, Arat-Koc, Bertram, & King, 2014) Indigeneity and diaspora are proximate cultural formations, having in common the experience of displacements from a homeland and marginalization in the metropolitan settler state but the differences in their histories of displacement have given them such different political trajectories that the distance between them can not simply be got across. (Coleman, 2016, p. 73) In a recent summer course on immigration and refugee protection in which I introduced substantial content on the constitutive relationship between immigrant and Indigenous dispossession and settler colonial nationalism, I invited two speakers to talk, respectively, about Indigenous and migrant justice. Dr. Ruth Koleszar-Green, a Mohawk scholar and activist articulated how inclusion into and recognition by the Canadian nation state is not akin to Indigenous self-determination in Turtle islands.1 Gabriel Allahdua, an organizer with Justicia for Migrant Workers (a Toronto-based grassroots organization), on the other hand, made a meticulous and passionate case for permanent status for migrant workers as a key avenue to end their unjust exploitation. Both speakers, in articulating their fraught relationship with the state, also articulated the key contradiction between immigrant and Indigenous justice projects. Indeed, appreciating these complexities and contradictions, and responding to their uptake in state policies, academic scholarship, and solidarity movements have emerged as a core political and ethical task for scholars and activists in settler states. This essay is an attempt to clarify and communicate where I – as an anti-racist scholar of immigration and nationalism – stand on this journey, the questions I am grappling with, and the analytical path I am considering. In this regard, the field-defining debate between Lawrence and Dua (2005) and Sharma and Wright (2008), especially over the notion of immigrant settlerhood, has long been a conversation opener. Lawrence and Dua (2005, p. 126) conceptualized settler colonialism as a complex configuration of White Europeans (historic settlers), racialized immigrants (conceptualized as settlers for being complicit in and benefitting from the settler project), and dispossessed Indigenous peoples within which the role of racialized immigrant settlement is perilously neglected, especially in anti-racist scholarship. ((ul))Sharma and Wright((/ul)) (2008, p. 121), on the other hand, ((ul))critiqued the ((/ul))((ul))conflation of immigration((/ul))((ul)) – which they argue is a ((/ul))((ul))key act of resistance in struggles for decolonial freedom((/ul))((ul)) – with ((/ul))((ul))settlement((/ul))((ul))/occupation as ‘colonization of resistance’. A substantial body of anti-racist scholarship that followed took on the important ethical task of conceptualizing the highly complex relationship between anti-racist politics – mobilized to secure migrant justice in an era of heightened dispossession globally – and Indigenous self-determination – which is fundamental to decolonizing the settler states((/ul)) (see Dhamoon, 2014 for an overview of this literature; also see Aboriginal Healing Foundation Series, 2011; Bauder, 2011; Haig-Brown, 2009; Sium, Desai, & Ritskes, 2012).2 While building on Lawrence and Dua’s staunch argument that anti-racist civil rights claims made to the settler nation state (cornerstones for immigrant integration) and challenges to the very legitimacy of that state (foundational to Indigenous self-determination) are in conflict, this scholarship also grappled with the intricate processes of global imperialism and the multiple and compounding logics of White supremacy that bring immigrant and Indigenous peoples in contested geopolitical spaces, and task them with the complex responsibility of carving out a common workable future (Jafri, 2012; Phung, 2011; Sehdev, 2011; Snelgrove, Dhamoon, & Contrassel, 2014; see also Feral Feminisms, 2015, special issue).3 What emerged at these intersections is the conceptual formation of immigrant settlerhood. A concept committed to the Indigenous difference (understood as unique and sovereign claim over lands currently claimed by Canada), and a politics of accountability for immigrant settlement on Indigenous land, ((ul))immigrant settlerhood((/ul))((ul)) enjoys significant political traction in current((/ul)) Canadian ((ul))anti-racist scholarship. Alongside a subsequent, growing acknowledgement of the ((/ul))((ul))irreconcilability((/ul))((ul)) of ((/ul))((ul))((hl))immigrant and Indigenous justice projects (see ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))Tuck & Yang((/hl))((/ul))((hl))e((/hl)) 2012), ((ul))it has displaced a necessary and an active engagement with immigration/immigrant settlement as a constitutive component of settler states((/ul)).4 As referred to in the opening epigraph to the essay, ((ul))((hl))this ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))de-linking((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) of immigrant labour exploitation and Indigenous land dispossession has ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))contributed to the mystification of settler political economy that thrives on the separation of both political subjects and projects((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).5((/hl)) As a scholar of immigration and nationalism, I signal the emergence of this concept as a sign of erosion of the analytical weight of racialized immigrant labour in theorizing settler nation formation. ((ul))((hl))In ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))conceptualizing the political goals of Indigenous self-determination and immigrant civil rights as conflictual((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)), at best ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))irreconcilable((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)), anti-racism((/hl))((/ul)), I suggest, ((ul))((hl))has ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))foreclosed a comprehensive and concrete analysis((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) of the contemporary settler colonial as a tightly wrought grid of ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))historic and ongoing capitalist colonial exploitation of land and labour, racialized precarity, and psychic and socio-legal legitimization ((/hl))((/ul))of White European((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))settlement((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). It is in this context, and also following my understanding of settler colonialism, Indigenous dispossession, and immigration/immigrant settlement as ((/ul))((ul))socially, historically, economically, and politically entangled practices((/ul))((ul)) that this essay argues for a re-articulation of racialized labour as a constitutive component in anti-racist theories of settler nation formation((/ul)). The essay develops in three major sections. First, I discuss what I mean by a comprehensive and concrete analysis of the settler colonial, while also discussing some of the challenges in launching such a critique. In the second section, I propose anti-racism considers ‘no border’ politics as it re-engages and re-aligns the question of racialized labour in theorizing settler colonial nationalism since notions of sovereignty, spatial belonging, and national borders6 primarily enact the conditions for exploitation of immigrants and thus impale them onto the settler project by shaping their civil rights claims. However, considering the centrality of land/place in Indigenous rights to decolonial freedom, I do not make the ‘no border’ proposal lightly. The third section of the essay, thus, draws from a diasporic understanding of political time (especially the ‘postcolonial’ political present), space, and critical solidarity scholarship to de-naturalize national borders as one way of bringing anti-racism closer to a comprehensive analysis of settler colonialism. I conclude by coming back to where I started, i.e. taking stock of where I am in this highly complex political and ethical journey. Towards a comprehensive analysis of the settler colonial: racialized labour in settler nation formation ((ul))What is a comprehensive analysis of contemporary settler colonialism and why has there been a move away from it?((/ul)) In his widely cited text Settler colonialism and the transformation of Anthropology, ((ul))Patrick ((/ul))((ul))Wolfe((/ul))((ul)) defined settler colonial invasion as ‘a structure not an event’((/ul)) (in Rifkin, 2013, p. 324), and argued that the key divide in settler states is between the settlers and Indigenous peoples. ((ul))In a recent article ‘Recuperating binarism’, ((/ul))((ul))Wolfe((/ul)) (2013, p. 259) ((ul))cautions that fracturing the binary understanding of settler colonialism, via a post-structural critique of essentialism and ethnic nationalism, runs the risk of ‘((/ul))((ul))endors[ing] colonial policy-making((/ul))((ul))’. In anti-racist scholarship on immigrant-Indigenous solidarity, this binarism is frequently upheld, albeit, as I have discussed above, with an acknowledgement of racialized and diasporic settlements happening along colonial and imperial pathways (for example, enslavement of Black peoples playing a historically constitutive role in US settler structure and neoliberal global capitalism continuing to dispossess at the periphery and thereby maintaining the cycle of Southern migration)((/ul)). While I appreciate the anti-racist understanding of the layered nature of colonial subject positions, firm rejection of the lure of liberal pluralist standard of sameness (as in ‘we are all colonized’), and its sophisticated analysis of what Razack (2015, p. 169) calls the ‘racial-spatial economies’ of settler nationalism, ((ul))I am concerned that in attending to Indigenous land expropriation, ((/ul))((ul))the exploitation of labouring bodies that enables this expropriation is cast aside((/ul)).7 ((ul))In centering Indigenous difference, the political problems of authenticity and sovereignty posed by diaspora narratives and theories are also relegated((/ul)); a point I come back to later in the essay. ((ul))Re-articulating racialized labour in theories of settler nation formation ((/ul))((ul))contests the kind of binary structure Wolfe insisted on((/ul))((ul)) and many anti-racist scholars concurred with, primarily by implicating immigrants in the settler project. ((/ul))((ul))Theirs is a triadic understanding((/ul))((ul)) of settler nationalism, which nevertheless, maintains the settler-indigenous binary. My conceptualization of racialized labour in the settler colonial equation is ((/ul))((ul))quite different((/ul))((ul)) in that I see it as ((/ul))((ul))constitutive of the inner logics of settler political economy((/ul))((ul)), and thus ((/ul))((ul))challenge the settler-Indigenous binary((/ul)). ((ul))I want to be clear that my goal is neither to claim specificity or uniqueness of oppression of racialized peoples, or, to render racialized people innocent by making colonialism ‘a discretely Anglo and Franco sin’((/ul)) (Stanley et al., 2014). ((ul))I ((/ul))((ul))caution against the weakening of the question of racialized labour((/ul))((ul)) in settler colonialism, more so in the context of ((/ul))((ul))ongoing structures of dispossession((/ul))((ul)), and a ((/ul))((ul))surge in autochthonous discourses globally((/ul)) (Geschiere, 2009).8 I acknowledge and agree with some of the ((ul))compelling questions((/ul)) that ((ul))have been raised about how de-linking immigration from settler colonialism is tantamount to ((/ul))((ul))claims of innocence that secure settler future((/ul))((ul)), and how decolonization has to be ((/ul))((ul))nonnegotiably about the tangible return of Indigenous land((/ul))((ul)) to Indigenous peoples((/ul)) (((ul))Tuck & Yang((/ul))e, 2012; see series of critique of Sharma & Wright, 2008 by Saranillio, 2013; 9 Dhamoon, 2014; Fujikane, 2008; Fujikane & Okamura, 2008; Snelgrove et al., 2014; see Stanley et al., 2014). ((ul))However, this scholarship tends to be largely driven by the binarism espoused by Wolfe discussed above((/ul)).10 ((ul))As postcolonial and critical race scholars have shown, constant re-conceptualizations/ re-alignments of racial categories (e.g. immigrant, alien, Indigenous, native) in response to ‘the local demands and rhythms of colonial rule’((/ul)) (Mawani, 2011, p. 169; see also Stoler, 1995) ((ul))is how the colonial state has historically functioned. The ((/ul))((ul))logics of colonial rule are multiple((/ul))((ul)), and ((/ul))((ul))full of productive contradictions((/ul))((ul)). Immigrants in the Western world((/ul))11 ((ul))have a long and complex history underpinned by Euro-American imperial ambitions, attendant strategies of settlement, and various forms of ruling relations like strategic granting of citizenship and other social rights((/ul)) (Lee, 2015; Ngai, 2014; Zolberg, 1987). ((ul))In settler states, immigration laws and controls exercised through such laws, on the one hand, allowed recruitment of racialized labour as necessary for national development and simultaneously cast them out as inassimilable aliens through discourses of deficit, deviance, and danger((/ul)) (see Boyko, 1995; Buchignani, Indra, & Srivastiva, 1985; Chatterjee, 2016; Dua, 2007). The very same state also mobilized discourses of disease and dysfunctionality to cast Indigenous people as disappearing and disallowed their systematic incorporation into the systems of wage labour to legitimize land appropriation (Churchill, 1998, 2010). ((ul))As ((/ul))((ul))Smith((/ul)) (2006) ((ul))explains((/ul)) in her influential text on the challenges of social movement and solidarity in a racially ranked world, ((ul))White supremacist colonial capitalism developed through the ((/ul))((ul))multiple logics((/ul))((ul)) of slavery, genocide, and orientalist wars. As such((/ul)), she concludes that ((ul))anti-racism as a principle ((/ul))((ul))requires a strong understanding of White supremacy as an interlinked structure of slavery, capitalism, orientalism, and genocide((/ul)). While colonized subjects are certainly not ‘commonly oppressed’, it is important to know that various modes and logics of their oppression ‘ … intersect and inform each other … ’ (Smith, 2010). ((ul))For example, different modes of colonial oppression were mobilized to ensure what Day((/ul)) (2016, p. 31) ((ul))calls the settler colonial objective of ‘expand[ing] white property,’ in this instance, by ‘[m]ixing alien labour with Indigenous land’. These differential strategies for the domination of immigrant and Indigenous subjects continue to manifest in our current political moment((/ul)). In Migration borders freedom, a monograph on the politics of border control, Geographer Harald Bauder (2016, p. 4) discusses ((ul))current migratory movements((/ul)) as ((ul))ranging from the widely documented escape from war and hunger, ‘to be with loved ones’, transportation and communicative technologies, and political developments like the fall of the iron curtain, the Arab Spring etc., to the more insidious and less visible integration of national economies and ‘corresponding growing political interdependency of countries’((/ul)). An explosive growth in the global working class over the last 30 years (a rough estimate is from 1.5 to 3 billion), largely due to the ((ul))‘accelerated dispossession’ through land and water grabs, mining and exploration, war, and even exploitation of natural disasters by nation states is also ‘at the heart of capitalist law of population’ to create the contemporary reserve army of labour((/ul)) (McNally, 2013). ((ul))Locally, aggressive importation of this largely postcolonial labour force((/ul)) (actively practised by the Canadian state, for example) ((ul))to be subsequently exploited and devalued is how the state continues to enact ((/ul))((ul))racialized precarity((/ul)).12 As well, there is ongoing cultural and economic decimation of Indigenous people, painfully manifest in their disproportionately high representation in the criminal justice and the child welfare systems and lack of representation in echelons of power, decision-making, and privilege. As I write this essay, yet another Indigenous youth in the province of Saskatchewan in Canada, Colten Boushie, has been shot to death for trespassing into the farm owned by Gerald Stanley, a White farmer who was acquitted of all charges and walked free. Hundreds of Indigenous women and girls remain missing while a long overdue public inquiry is mired in a bureaucratic quagmire. There have been much ceremonious declarations and pledges on the part of the Canadian state to follow-up on the series of recommendations made by the Truth and Reconciliation (TRC) of Canada (TRC, 2015) to stop and redress the structural violence of the Canadian state against Indigenous families via its residential school policies, and current child protection, criminal justice, and higher education systems. Indeed, the Canadian state has started carrying out the relevant recommendations of the TRC, and yet it is doing so in ways that Dene political scientist Coulthard (2013) has critiqued as ‘scraps of recognition’. Coulthard (2016) cautions, ‘a blockage to the principle of relentless accumulation’ or a change to ‘the business as usual’ necessary for reconciliation is nowhere to be seen.13 Instead, recognition and reconciliation mask ‘a new logic of dispossession’ (see also Walia, 2015, Interview with Glen Coulthard). Further, we neglect at our own peril that record high numbers of immigrants continue to be recruited by Canada via an increasingly pro-corporation selection model (Keung, 2017). As well, while the universities are involved in actively Indigenizing the curricula,14 many (if not all) are also aggressively recruiting international students as part of a nation-wide higher education internationalization plan.15 These are but some explicit manifestations of a mode of governance that continues unabated even as I am writing about it. What is the value of focusing on the more manifest inter-subjective relations and social hierarchies between variously colonized subjects when some of these deeper structural complexities and contradictions continue to animate the political economy of the settler society?16 As immigrants fight their marginalization, atomization, and precarity by trying to secure their future by engaging in the structures of the very state, they end up strengthening the project of settlement. As Saranillio (2013) writes in his defense of the conceptual category of Asian settler colonialism: ((ul))While migration in and of itself does not equate to colonialism, migration to a settler colonial space, where Native land and resources are under political, ecological, and spiritual contestation, means the political agency of immigrant communities can bolster a colonial system initiated by White settlers. This is particularly so since the avenues laid out for success and empowerment are paved over native lands and sovereignty((/ul)). (Saranillio, 2013, p. 286)17 In a similar vein, Historian of Icelandic migration in Canada Laurie Bertram (in Stanley et al., 2014) writes: ‘The very process of becoming a good, successful, moral, and respectable citizen with access to the resources of the state transforms newcomers into colonialists.’ 18 ((ul))However((/ul)), Sara Ahmed’s (2014) distinction between self-care and self-indulgence in the context of marginalized people is instructive here: Perhaps we need to ask: who has enough resources not to have become resourceful? When you have less resources you might have to become more resourceful. Of course: the requirement to become more resourceful is part of the injustice of a system that distributes resources unequally. Of course: becoming resourceful is not system changing even if it can be life changing … Even if it’s system change we need … when the system does not change, when the walls come up, those hardening of history into physical barriers in the present, you have to manage; to cope. Your choices are compromised when a world is compromised. From a purely political economic perspective as well, ‘disavowing personal accumulation’ is nearly impossible in capitalism as‘the imperatives of capitalism reward it’ (McNally, 2011, p. 191).19 In her response to Bauder’s (2011) call to bridge the ‘parallax gap’ between immigrant and Indigenous issues which fell within the binarism again, Sedef Arat-Koc (in Stanley et al., 2014) touches on a similar point: ((ul))We need to remember that the need, the anxiety, and the desire to belong in a racist society may lead on the part of racialized immigrants to gestures of assimilation and support for dominant structures and ideologies of settler society … The play of xenophobia and xenophilia in nationalist discourses may, through the anxiety it produces, often ensure conformity into the dominant order on the part of immigrants. As such((/ul)), she writes, ((ul))it is important that in our accountability work for Indigenous colonization, we make the ‘useful’ distinction between White settlers and racialized immigrants. While incorporation into a racist, sexist White supremacist order is indeed not akin to freedom((/ul)) (see Walia, 2013) 20, ((ul))in conflating immigrant rights claims with colonial settlerhood anti-racist thought leaves immigrants and anti-racist advocates without options in the face of ongoing onslaughts of racial subjectification((/ul)). ((ul))In contrast to a dialectical thinking, what dominates is a ((/ul))((ul))system of thought ontologizing the figures of the immigrant, Indigenous, and settler, voiding them of any constitutive link between and within themselves((/ul))((ul)), and especially in relation to White supremacist capitalism of the settler colonial variety((/ul)).21 In my attempt to work a way out of this analytical morass befitting a highly atomising late capitalist order I turn to ((ul))scholars working against the separation of political economic critique from racial, gendered, and other axes of oppression((/ul)). As such, each subsequent part of the paper ((ul))works toward bringing racialized labour back into our understanding of the dynamics of settler colonialism so as ((/ul))((ul))not to lose sight of the capitalist colonial project of simultaneous dispossession (of Indigenous peoples) and precarious incorporation (of racialized immigrants)((/ul)). Capitalism produces and thrives on atomization and separation of human subjects (Bakan, 2008). Yet, there has been a suturing of colonial, racialized, and gendered formations from capitalist production relations in our critique (Bannerji, 2005). Bannerji considers it a manifestation of a ‘segmentation of the overall social’ (p. 145) in which the ‘key ideological building blocks of power and oppression’ have been separated into cultural (race), social (gender, patriarchy), and economic (class) phenomena instead of being ‘as altogether and all at once’ (p. 144). Sharing similar concerns with the piecemeal manner the contemporary social has come to be theorized, Bakan (2008) calls for an analysis of the historical relations between racism and capitalism (and I will add in this context, nationalism). Reorienting anti-racist critique towards what Bannerji (2005, p. 157) understands as a ‘non-fragmentary understanding of the social’, without, however, surrendering to a liberal pluralist standard of sameness, requires such a concrete and comprehensive analysis. What is the key barrier to such an analysis? In their widely critiqued article, Sharma and Wright (2008) wondered whether decolonization – instead of territorial independence – is not a larger project of freedom from oppressive relationships, and whether it could not be materialized through other, ‘more transformative and effective paths to liberation than the national sovereignty project’. 22 In her later work, Sharma (2015) suggested the separation of Indigenous justice claims from questions of land and jurisdictions, a suggestion widely critiqued as a sign of their lack of appreciation of the unique ontology of Indigenous nationhood. A detailed discussion on Indigenous nationalism and how I respond to its compelling formulation of land as not territory but relationship is material for another time and venue, and a project I am very seriously engaged with in my current scholarship. For now, I suggest we at least spend some time on the argument against rootedness and territorial belonging to see if we can make any conceptual headway toward a more tangible critique of the settler colonial as it manifests in the contemporary political order. In short, I am proposing that ((ul))a privileging of spatialized belonging underpins the notion of immigrant settlerhood and this idea should be unpacked((/ul)). The possibilities of ‘no border’ politics in anti-racist response to settler colonialism Immigrants are from somewhere else. While their pathways to the New World are various and complex, they cannot but be settlers on Indigenous land. This is a curious idea if one thinks historically about freedom of movement being ‘the oldest and also the most elementary’ of rights (Arendt, in Bauder, 2016, p. 7). Seeing movement as an anomaly emerged hand in hand with the European nation state model, introduced via the Peace of Westphalia23, strengthening through early and later industrial capitalist colonialism (Sharma, 2010), and European elite’s struggles against the anti-capitalist, anti-establishment revolutionary currents sweeping through Europe between 1200 and 1600. The modern sovereign state, armed with the White supremacist principles of the Enlightenment, was the key mechanism to contain these insurrectionary forces. Apart from the European elite’s struggle with the European working class their quest for control over their colonial Others (first in the Americas and then elsewhere) also facilitated the sovereign nation and the system of nation states we so take for granted today: Modern sovereignty emerged, then, as the concept of European reaction and European domination both within and outside its borders. They are two coextensive and complementary faces of one development: rule within Europe and European rule over the world. (Hardt & Negri, 2000, p. 70) Indeed, in their history of early Atlantic colonization Historians Linebaugh and Rediker (2000, p. 28) documented the revolt of ‘the motley crew’ of sailors, slaves, pirates, women, and commoners, who, against the terrors of enclosure and coercive deployment into industrial wage labour, carried the imagination of a radically different society, demonstrating the hydra-like nature of the desire for decolonial freedom. Their frequently multiethnic solidarity was facilitated by cross-border movements, for, as a reviewer in Do or Die (2003) eloquently states: … not only slaves, sugar and tobacco travelled on the ships. News travelled too – underground news of slave revolts, of revolutions in Haiti, France and America; new ideas and new tactics. People travelled too – radicals who had stirred up trouble in England were transported overseas and spread their ideas, while travellers who had seen in the indigenous peoples of the Americas that a free life in harmony with nature was possible, brought their ideas back to Europe. This fight for an alternative to early colonial capitalism was not utopian dreaming but grounded in the experience of commoning which ‘was a living memory for many,’ more so among the African slaves and the Indigenous people of the Americas who ‘provided a clear example to the early settlers of a functioning society without the state, wageslavery, money, class divisions or exploitation’ (Linebaugh & Rediker, 2000; see also Sharma & Wright, 2008).24 In other words, a world divided into nation states and nationalized/spatialized identities, while dominating our imagination, is quite new and its control over people’s movement ‘took hundreds of years to come to fruition’ (Torpey, in Bauder, 2016, p. 23). Late capitalist international borders, on the other hand, are not so much about controlling movements but about zoning in ‘spatially fixed labour’ (McNally, 2013) for exploitation in Southern mass manufacturing facilities while procuring the movable labour for North in precarious, politically subjugated conditions, which then could be harnessed in the service of capital. As Sharma (2010, p. 233) simply but evocatively writes: ‘[m]any industries and economies around the world would completely collapse without the participation of non-nationals in nationalized space’ (see also Bauder, 2006; Hage, 2000; Sharma, 2006, 2012; Walia & Chu, 2015). Contemporary national border is the key technology that not only allows this contradiction, but normalizes it through the notion of the sovereign state (see Anderson, Sharma, & Wright, 2009). It is the key actor in the chilling drama of exploitation and racialized ordering in which the political project of migrant justice and civil rights, that Walia (2013) has rightfully critiqued as a struggle ‘to be visible and desirable within an oppressive system,’ takes shape. Therefore, ((ul))it is important for anti-racist thought to take note of the political utility of contemporary national borders in securing ((/ul))((ul))settler futurity((/ul))((ul)). And it is here that ‘no border’ politics – with its potential to expose the tensions and contradictions between migrant organizing and Indigenous self-determination as a ‘((/ul))((ul))false debate((/ul))((ul))’((/ul)) (Left Turn, 2007) – ((ul))appears significant((/ul)).25 In other words, ((ul))the analytical erosion of racialized labour stems from the privileging of spatial belonging and it should be worked against((/ul)). A space between ‘place’ and ‘space’? In defense of ‘no border’ for a comprehensive critique of the contemporary settler colonial Considering the centrality (indeed non-negotiability) of a place-based politics in Indigenous self-determination, I do not make the ‘no border’ proposition flippantly. My holding spatial belonging accountable for the neglect of the materiality of labour in settler colonial theories, and advocating for a ‘no border’ political imaginary as a corrective, I must also acknowledge, is coming from a Western onto-epistemological understanding of border and nation.26 However, the stripping off of social and economic questions of land and labour exploitation and replacing those critical concerns with essentializing approaches to culture, community, and representation, have been concerning for Indigenous scholars as well. Many have critiqued the sidelining of the emergence of the Indigenous as a political response to settler colonial dispossession (Lyons, 2015; see Arat-Koc, in Stanley et al., 2014 for a brief but useful overview; see also Alfred & Corntassesl, 2005 for a dynamic view of Indigeneity that does not lend itself to the state politics of recognition I mention above and which Coulthard critiqued so powerfully). Also, going back to my earlier reference to a non-fragmentary social analysis, I reiterate what I am aiming for here is ((ul))an analysis that can hold labour and land, and allied questions of dispossession and exploitation in dialectical balance/tension, while ((/ul))((ul))not giving in to a reductionist or essentialist understanding of either mode and experience of oppression((/ul)). I invoke Marxist, feminist, and anti-racist scholar Bannerji (2005, p. 146), who, in calling for a politics beyond the economic reductionism of structural Marxism or cultural reductionism of ‘identity and fundamentalist politics,’ stated: ‘[n]either of these readings of social ontology allows us to do justice to politics for social justice. Our theoretical journey must begin somewhere else to reach another destination’. My proposal is also informed by a postcolonial disaporic experience. Unlike Indigenous peoples, the diaspora has a contested relationship with the place as they grapple with the turning of an anti-colonial imaginary of liberation into the postcolonial ‘dead-end’ (Scott, 2004, p. 1), and subsequent displacement from purported homelands. As the homeland dissolves into the flotsam and jetsam of the diaspora, rootedness and belonging start losing meaning. Indeed, who can demand to open the borders but diasporic subjects like myself who are left without a home in the traditional sense of the term? As a postcolonial Indian diasporic subject, this is my everyday and everynight struggle. Adding to this is the postcolonial decay of the Indian nation state, which is largely responsible for one of the biggest and growing diaspora in the world. The very West India fought so tirelessly to wrench free from has become its destiny. Sojourns abroad for social, economic, professional pursuits, and transnational business alliances have become the touchstone for success. Yes, the Indians are free political subjects, but, as Spivak (2013) reminds us, the failure of decolonization started the day after negotiated political freedom. On the other hand, belonging in the Indian nation state is fiercely defined along religious and ethnic lines, and a fascist state is re-writing the history of India as that of a Hindu nation. Thus, ((ul))while I appreciate the relevance for a place-based politics Indigenous sovereignty that current anti-racist thought espouses, and from which immigrant settlerhood garners its analytical currency, a hoped-for space between ‘place’ and ‘space’ based politics is what I am striving towards((/ul)) (see Coleman, 2016). This is ((ul))because I do not want to lose sight of our ‘target of critique’((/ul)) as Dhamoon (Snelgrove et al., 2014) calls it, ((ul))which is settler colonial nationalism, and which((/ul)), as I discuss above, ((ul))thrives on Western nation statist borders between sites and subjects((/ul)). As Coleman (2016) states in the epigraph to this essay ((ul))the political trajectories and objectives of diasporic and Indigenous peoples are vastly different and this difference cannot simply be wished away. How do we((/ul)), for example, ((ul))approach the very complex goal of decolonizing the settler nation in a world where people are ‘chronically mobile and routinely displaced’((/ul)) (Malkki, 1992, p. 24), ((ul))and in which the immigrant currently is a key political figure((/ul)) (Nail, 2015)((ul))?((/ul)) I wonder whether ((ul))a framework that honours the right to move/settle to challenge capitalist colonial dispossession and the right to self-determination by centering the land in decolonizing actions offer any conceptual headway?((/ul)) I want us ((ul))to pause and consider the possibilities of bridging people’s right to mobility with their right to stay, reclaim, and take care of the land they have a genealogical, ancestral, ethical, and political relationship with/responsibility for((/ul)). In a collective interview on the Left Turn (2007) titled ‘Organizing for migrant justice and self-determination,’ some activist scholars offer the kind of comprehensive insights on capitalism, racism, and colonialism that current anti-racist literature seems to be disarticulated from, and I am suggesting, it re-engages with. Suggesting a delinking of ‘the idea of migration from settler-colonialism, which is a capitalist and colonial ideology,’ Harsha Walia forwards a non-conflictual vision of the right to freedom of movement and ‘inherent claims to land and territory’: In the ideal anti-capitalist world that I wish to live in, the borders between fighting in the homeland/fighting in exile disappear as the idea of ownership and entitlements to different spaces is eradicated. Similarly, ((ul))Jaggi Singh critiqued the presumed tension between the right to remain and freedom of movement as a ‘false debate’ since these ‘are two essential elements to the assertion of collective and individual self-determination((/ul)).’ ((ul))Nandita Sharma built on her earlier critique of anti-racist conflation of migration/mobility with settlement((/ul)) (see Sharma & Wright, 2008), ((ul))stating ‘ … ideas of being “at home” are still very much racialized or nationalized.’ Alerting that such notions are ‘not only part of the Right but also, in many case, part of thinking of the most radical parts of the Left((/ul)),’ she suggested that ((ul))the romanticism of home as ‘a static idea’ forms another end of the spectrum from the xenophobic ‘everybody go home’((/ul)). 27 Thus, in posing the notion of sovereign borders as capitalist and colonial, ((ul))‘no border’ politics decouples the notion of home/belonging from specific locales and allows anti-racism to re-integrate labour into its analysis of settler colonialism while also working against the idea ‘that the social justice demands of indigenous people and migrants are inherently at odds with one another’((/ul)) (Left Turn, 2007). As Sharma (2010, pp. 232–233) powerfully contended: The main reasons for why over 190 million people engage in cross-border migration every year is global in scope and includes the expansion of capitalist social relations, particularly into rural economies … the global crisis of unemployment and underemployment, ongoing modernist projects of capitalist ‘development’ … While these processes are most often initiated by a power that is most concentrated in the Global North, migrants from the Global South are seen as the ones who are taking what is not theirs to have. Conclusion ((ul))This is ((/ul))((ul))not an attempt to free the immigrant subject from the weight of settlerhood((/ul))((ul)) (see ((/ul))((ul))Tuck & Yang((/ul))e, ((ul))2012 on ‘((/ul))((ul))settler move to innocence((/ul))((ul))’)((/ul)). I tend to ((ul))agree((/ul)) with Rita Dhamoon here ((ul))that such projects shift our attention away from White supremacist capitalism and heteropatriarchy, which should be ‘our target of critique’((/ul)) (Snelgrove et al., 2014, p. 12). ((ul))However, when ((/ul))((ul))global imperial strategies of dispossession((/ul))((ul)) followed by ((/ul))((ul))immigrants’ material deprivation((/ul))((ul)), necessary tools for continuing the violence of settlement are ((/ul))((ul))neglected in theorizing((/ul))((ul)) the contemporary settler colonial, ((/ul))((ul))immigrants get visibility/recoded as settlers((/ul))((ul)) while the capitalist colonial modes of ((/ul))((ul))dispossession((/ul))((ul)), atomization, and ((/ul))((ul))pitting dispossessed people against each other((/ul))((ul)) recede into the background((/ul)).28 ((ul))This is why immigrant settlerhood, increasingly a status acknowledgement to be heard across progressive coalitions((/ul)) across Canada, ((ul))should not be taken as a mere practice of accountability, self-location, and/or awareness of self-location. We need to rather ask what it offers in terms of our analysis of settler colonialism, a specific mode of production that thrives on the simultaneous dispossession of Indigenous peoples and precarious resettlement of immigrants. Instead of placing structurally innately connected issues of immigrant and Indigenous rights onto separate political registers I suggest anti-racism develop a ((/ul))((ul))more nuanced understanding((/ul))((ul)) of the contemporary settler colonial as an interlinked structure of immigration, labour exploitation, and Indigenous dispossession ‘to understand how ((/ul))((ul))[immigrants’] racialized vulnerability and disposability supports a settler colonial project((/ul))((ul))’((/ul)) (Day, 2016, p. 21). In this regard, ((ul))Jafri’s((/ul)) (2012) ((ul))argument that ((/ul))((ul))settlerhood is better understood ‘as a field of operations into which we become socially positioned and implicated’ rather than ‘as an object that subjects possess’((/ul))((ul)) is insightful((/ul)).29 As I bring this paper to a close these discussions and debates surrounding a decolonial future in settler states continue and is turning out to be a compendium of many subjects, crossing multiple disciplinary boundaries. My attempts to engage this subject, specifically via challenging the notion of immigrant settlerhood as a conceptual barrier to a concrete analysis, are integrally tied to my desire to be at a place of greater conceptual clarity around this multifaceted subject demanded by the history and politics of our time. For me, an immigrant settled in Canada, it is also a project that is geopolitical, onto-epistemological, and ethical. In their 2012 co-authored paper, Indigenous Education scholar Eve Tuck and self-described ‘trespasser’ scholar Wayne Yange (p. 17) write about ‘colonial equivocation,’ which happens when people oppressed by settler states collapse their experience as that of colonization and thus absolve themselves of settlerhood, as a ‘settler move to innocence.’ In a trenchant analysis positing the care of the self (in a political sense as opposed to its neoliberal, self-indulgent avatar) as akin to addressing structural inequities Sara Ahmed (2014), however, cautions us to be mindful about the role of individual responsibility and accountability in social justice: ‘And how interesting: the individual disappears at the very moment he is called into account.’ 30 She writes: ‘Calling out the individual matters, even when the system is also what is bruising … ’ I am not sure if what motivated me to delve deeper into this subject, especially examine the analytical importance of immigrant settlerhood and advocate for ‘a concrete social analysis’ (Bannerji, 2005, p. 156) that does not lose sight of the capitalist colonial simultaneities/rhythms of dispossession and resettlement, is an implicit drive for this ‘innocence’. This task of figuring out my ‘personal stake in this struggle’ (Lawrence & Dua, 2005, p. 126) continues. Meanwhile, in my work on this subject, ((ul))I am aiming for, as I said, a comprehensive social ontology of the contemporary settler colonial. In such an analysis centering the settler political economy, I suggest, the aforementioned tensions between anti-racism and Indigenous self-determination will be clarified as structural conditions and internal logics of settler colonial nationalism((/ul)). Unlike Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz (Baum, 1900), I do not think our choices on the crossroads of the yellow brick lane have to be so sharply defined (see my references to Bannerji, 2005, 2015; Bakan, 2008 about the suturing of modes of oppression).31 ((ul))The project of decolonization is messier and requires the ongoing precision of our analytical thinking((/ul)) (King, 2014). ((ul))I suggest current anti-racist scholarship, while challenging us to think about the messy actualities of decolonial solidarity (that solidarity is not simply to be wished for), also ((/ul))((ul))((hl))manifests a problematic and analytically costly decoupling of cultural and political economic considerations((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)). ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))Together with the essentialized understanding of home and belongingness as geographically fixed, this severance is normalizing a kind of ahistoricism that could cost anti-racism a lucid understanding of the current workings of settler colonial nationalism((/hl))((/ul)). I therefore ((ul))ur((/ul))((ul))((hl))ge anti-racist scholars to ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))move beyond the rather clean-cut binary of settler-Indigenous((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)), and ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))bring back racialized labour-capital-nation nexus((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) into the settler colonial equa((/hl))((/ul))((ul))tion((/ul)).32 This is not to say that personal responsibility/accountability (in this context, of immigrants settling on occupied lands) does not matter or to make it ‘disappear into the collective’/structural (Ahmed, 2014), but ((ul))to alert us to the diminishing analytical significance of racialized migration and labour in anti-racist theories of settler colonialism so as to ((/ul))((ul))((hl))avoid reproducing a binary of cultural and political economic frameworks for decolonial justice((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).((/hl))"],"stats":{"highlightedWords":179}},{"tag":"Our reps identified a shared threat stemming from the settler present, the avoidance of which opens plural futures for the making – which is good","cite":"Joseph J.Z.

Just guess.” Signs of the Future One of the more recent additions to the socio-landscape of Old Massett, which I noticed on a return visit in 2014, was a series of blue signs that had appeared in many of the lawns on reserve and a good few uptown. The sign was a good two feet high and emblazoned with capitalized text: UNITED AGAINST ENBRIDGE. Below the text was a picture of a salmon. The salmon and the first word, “UNITED,” were in stark, attention-grabbing white, while the other text was in black. The signs, I later discovered, were distributed for five dollars each by the “Friends of Wild Salmon,” a coalition of northern British Columbia residents – including both First Nations and non-First Nations members – working together to oppose the Enbridge Gateway Pipeline Project.1 Perhaps appropriately, then, I noticed the sign on the lawns of both Haida and non-Haida, in Old Massett, (New) Masset, and out by Towtown. The signs may have been new, but their message is one that should have become familiar to us at this point: ((ul))The people of Haida Gwaii oppose “Enbridge;” that is, The Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipelines Project((/ul)). The project, first proposed in the mid-2000s, seeks to construct two pipelines to transport crude oil and condensate from northern Alberta to Kitimat on the coast of British Columbia.2 The oil would then be transported via “super-tanker” from the coast, through the Hecate Straight that passes between the west coast and the islands of Haida Gwaii before being exported to other nations (particularly China). Enbridge has received heavy support for the project from Canada’s current Conservative government, headed by Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and in 2013 the Enbridge Joint-Review Panel – despite the words of hippies and Haida alike, alongside fierce opposition from all over the northwest coast - approved the pipelines, albeit with 209 required conditions.3 As a partnership between Canadian federal and corporate interests, the Enbridge Pipelines Project promises a future horizon of economic prosperity, one that unequivocally justifies any environmental risk in the present. ((ul))On Haida Gwaii, Enbridge presages a rather different future, one in which the unpredictable waters of the Hecade Straight all but guarantee a tanker spill. Such a spill would devastate the waters and lands of the islands and the neighbouring coastline of British Columbia, destroying the fish and poisoning the plants that currently draw on ocean waters and the animals that feed thereon((/ul)). Neither eagles nor ravens could survive, living as they do on a diet that consists primarily of marine life, a fact which ((ul))all but guarantees the disappearance of Eagles and Ravens, the Haida people whose lifeways as such are so fundamentally tied to the islands of Haida Gwaii. Haida Gwaii could no longer be home((/ul)). A song recorded in protest again Enbridge by Aboriginal artist Kinnie Starr and animated as a music video by Haidawood, ((ul))a team of Haida and non-Haida stop-motion artists and animators, makes this threat explicit, asking((/ul)) in its opening lines “((ul))Who will save these waters((/ul)), save them for our great granddaughters, save them for our great grand-daughter’s sons, […] ((ul))save them before all is dead and gone?((/ul))”4 ((ul))This nightmare future, this future that is no future, is one that looms large over the whole of this dissertation. It is familiar because it is a reiteration of the ((/ul))((ul))horror of ecological cataclysm((/ul))((ul)) that the CHN formed itself in opposition against, that the “hippies” risk metonymically bringing about by taking from the lands and waters without respect. But it is also familiar because in a broader sense it is ((/ul))((ul))the future that settler colonialism attempted((/ul))((ul)) to give to Native peoples; indeed, to render as their already given destiny. This is the future of indigenous erasure, of ultimate disappearance, of a closed temporality which can only end in “((/ul))((ul))all dead and gone((/ul))((ul)).((/ul))” As I have also hopefully shown in each of my chapters, ((ul))however, the future of “no future” is never taken as inevitable or already determined by Haida people. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))The work of future-making instead ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))always acts to ward off the nightmare future((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) of Haida erasure, always ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))puts in its place instead multiple possible futures((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) in which Haida people continue((/ul)). Take the blue signs on the lawns of the Masset(t)s, Old and New, implicitly answering Kinnie Starr’s question with the bold declaration that the islands (will) stand “UNITED” against Enbridge. ((ul))But the social significances of these futures are never encompassed solely by the ways in which they respond to the threat of nightmare futures((/ul)). As we saw in Chapter 3, for instance, ((ul))the production of a future of Haida and non-Haida unity is considerably more complicated than the declaration of shared solidarity, speaking back to a particular history of Haida and settler relations and fantasy schemas, looking forward towards finding productive ways in which non-Haida can be integrated into Haida systems of sociality and responsibility. To speak of a future united against Enbridge is thus necessarily to speak of many other things, just as it is the case when speaking of a future of Haida return, a future of care-full leadership, or a future of traditional authority. Larger social worlds unfold out of the constitution of particular futures((/ul)). This is why, more than anything, I want to make clear in the final, concluding chapter of this dissertation that ((ul))the ((/ul))((ul))political((/ul))((ul)) (if not ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))existential((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))) ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))significance((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)).((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) of Haida future-((/ul))((ul))((hl))making does ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))not((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) lie simply in the ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))specific ways in which individual futures respond to particular dilemmas of the settler colonial present((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). Rather, what is most crucial about future-making as a way of thinking out from within the temporal brackets of settler colonialism’s deferred erasure is simply the ((/ul))((ul))fact of future-making itself((/ul))((ul)). What matters the most is the capacity to say((/ul)), as Haida rapper Ja$e ElNino does in a guest appearance in Starr’s song, “Now expect the best from the northwest/ ((ul))What’s next?((/ul)) Just guess.” ElNino ((ul))asserts the openness of the future((/ul)), challenging his listeners to even attempt to predict the field of possibilities still to come. This does not mean, though, that this openness is unmoored. Quite the opposite, ElNino asks us to “expect the best of the northwest,” in response to the threat of Enbridge and, I think, more generally. In this spirit, in what follows I highlight the significance of location to indigenous futurity, exploring how Old Massett, its neighbouring communities along Masset Inlet, and the lands and waters of Haida Gwaii act as locations around which the very openness of Haida futures can be articulated. My discussion will be largely synthetic, reading together my previous chapters to attempt to arrive at a few conclusions for this dissertation at a whole. I begin with a discussion of Haida Gwaii, once again, as “home,” asking what it means to consider the islands as a Haida homeland (and one that requires “care” as such) in the light of the futures I have sketched out. I then draw on this to pose a few suggestions for the political anthropology of indigenous peoples and its abiding contemporary concern with sovereign rights and territoriality. Finally, I conclude by drawing out the multiple meanings of my titular phrase, “unsettling futures,” in the context of Haida futuremaking. Homeland Haida Gwaii is in at least some sense at the center of each of the futures I have discussed in this dissertation. It is the home to which Haida are expected (and expect) to return, the “cornucopia” of off-the-grid fantasy, the ongoing historical space of complex social and material relations that these fantasies elide, the perpetually at risk ecological landscape which demands (and authorizes) the CHN’s care and respect. And, as we have seen, ((ul))these various futures for the islands are not isolated from one another. Quite the opposite, futures proliferate in response to each other. The potential for non-Haida homing necessitates strategic forms of future-oriented social integration to bring these new arrivals into respectful relations with the Haida world, the nightmare non-future of ecological collapse is warded off by the attempt to constitute care-full futures under Haida control. What all these Haida futures have in common – at least as they relate to the islands - is that they work to preserve Haida Gwaii((/ul)), and the community of Old Massett in particular, ((ul))as spaces in which Haida futures remain possible((/ul)). This fact, as I have already begun to suggest in Chapter 2, might ((ul))help us to resolve((/ul)) some of James Clifford’s ((ul))dilemmas in relation to indigenous mobility((/ul)). As I pointed towards then, ((ul))the notion that “place” is significant to indigenous peoples – politically, socially, affectively, culturally – has become one of the essential components of how “indigeneity” is understood as a global phenomenon and a strategic identity from which rights claims can be advanced((/ul)). Take Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples: Indigenous peoples have the right to maintain and strengthen their distinctive spiritual relationship with their traditionally owned or otherwise occupied and used lands, territories, waters and coastal seas and other resources and to uphold their responsibilities to future generations in this regard (Assembly 2007:10, emphasis mine). But what precisely does it mean to have a “distinctive, spiritual relationship” to a place, and who determines what might constitute that relationship? Here one of the perils of Povinelli’s “cunning of recognition,” as indigenous rights to territory become conflated with - and evaluated against - essentialized settler notions of Native ecological spirituality and/or emplacedness (cf: Raibmon 2005; Nadasdy 2003). If indigeneity thereby takes on the significance of being “rooted” in a particular place, of having certain identifiably “distinctive” cultural relationships to that place that others might lack, then the fact of indigenous mobility would indeed pose a profound dilemma for the category of indigeneity on the one hand and the capacity to make claims to territorial rights qua one’s indigeneity on the other. But there is a remarkable temporal shallowness to all this. To give a representative example, the Australian state criteria for what constitutes “cultural rights to territory” that Povinelli interrogates function solely in the past and the present, mandating that Aboriginal people show continuity of occupation and of the cultural practices associated with “Aboriginal occupation” in the mind of the court in order to be recognized as possessing a rightful claim to their home territories (Povinelli 2002). ((ul))Erased in this is the possibility that a territory could be the site of departure and return, that it could have a future horizon that is flexible, subject to transformation alongside the transformations of the people(s) who call it home, without thereby necessarily losing its integrity as a rightful space of indigenous occupation. Such a possibility is not controversial for my Haida interlocutors. Rather, it has the status of an already-given certainty, community common sense - though there is without doubt much social work that goes into the production of that certainty((/ul)). What makes indigenous mobility fraught, then, might have rather more to do with the constitution of settler polities than it does with the actual practices of indigenous peoples. Consider the various ways in which we have already seen colonial authorities attempt to control Haida movement, from the forced expulsions of 19th century Victoria to the removal of Haida children from the islands for residential schools less than a century later. Consider too the manufacture of the reserves themselves, the fixing of two Haida “Bands” with their own federally determined territories, beyond which Haida people could claim no rights over land, waters, or resources (cf: Harris 2002). This is a logic of containment, of isolation. In leaving their assigned spaces, Native peoples were assumed by colonial authorities to be leaving the space of their Nativeness behind, assimilating into settler society on its terms. Indeed, this was the motivating logic of the residential schools program, which took as its premise the idea that “Indians” could always “backslide” into “savage customs” as long as they remained in their homes and with their families. Aboriginal children thus had to be brought somewhere else to learn how to join “civilized,” that is, white Christian, society (Miller 1996). Reserves could thus be rendered as the last bastions of a “weird and waning race,” to quote Scott, their inhabitants temporally foreclosed and spatially fixed. The notion that indigenous people could move without ceasing to be (or ceasing to fight for their rights to self-determination and Title to their lands) unsettles this narrative, just as does the intertwined possibility of indigenous futurity. The relationship to Haida Gwaii that we’ve seen sketched out by the Haida futures explored in this dissertation does not preclude the possibility of “distinctive spiritual relationships” between Haida and their home territories. Quite the opposite, the ineffable quality of homing alone suggests that many of my interlocutors feel a connection to their home that goes beyond the kinds of practices that are only possible on the islands, their beauty or their history. Indeed, when considered as home, when considered as a site that requires care, there is little doubt that Haida Gwaii can encompass a wide range of phenomenological, affective, social, and cultural ways of relating to its lands and waters by Haida people (and their neighbours, at times for good, at times for ill). But it is not these relations as such that encompass the totality of Haida Gwaii’s significance. Rather, what is of greatest concern to my interlocutors is the continuing future possibility that relations like that could be formed, that people could continue to be called home to Haida Gwaii once they’ve fully explored the world off-island, that the qualities that precisely make Haida Gwaii home could be preserved. This is what it means, I think, to “take care” of Haida Gwaii, to allow it to continue as a homeland for uncounted future generations. ((ul))Though they certainly emphasize the need for Haida Gwaii to be maintained as a location for Haida futurity, this does not mean that the futures we have seen expend all the possible ways in which such future forms of Haida social, material, ecological, and relational life could be formed((/ul)). Recall Ja$e ElNino’s challenge of a future so open that its possible contents can only be guessed at. ((ul))What Haida future-making demonstrates is that there are a set of potentialities which are worth protecting so that Haida people can continue to access them, to come home to them, even as continuing forms of mobility and political processes can also shape and reshape Haida social and cultural life on and off the islands((/ul)). Homeland is not a regimented place where Haida people must always live in order to be authentically Haida. Rather, it is a location where they should always be able to, in their own (necessarily multiple, often contested, sometimes even contradictory) terms. Sovereignty ((ul))At the same time, there is an inescapably political dimension to the attempt to render Haida Gwaii as the homeland of a still open Haida future((/ul)). The assertion of the (located) openness of the future does not necessarily make it so. As I noted in the first part of this dissertation, ((ul))the flow of Haida departures and returns unfold in the broader context of the settler, capitalist state; indeed, they are made necessary in part by the current absence of economic opportunity((/ul)) on island, ((ul))just as the arrival of potentially threatening strangers is a result of their privileged position in the very capitalist economy they seek to escape. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Constituting futures in which Haida people have the ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))freedom to engage with((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) that economy (and ((/ul))((ul))((hl))settler society((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) more generally) as they see ((/ul))((ul))((hl))fit while retaining the capacity to come home((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) (complicated as that process might be) also ((/ul))((ul))((hl))reiterates the ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))inescapability of some form of engagement with that socio-economy((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).((/hl)) Likewise, the notion of Haida Gwaii as Haida homeland cannot be separated from current Haida struggles to assert their rights to the lands and waters of Haida Gwaii, the resources found therein, and their sovereign capacity to govern themselves and the islands in the ways they find appropriate. This is, recall, the very crux of the CHN’s own commitment to the assurance of futurity, as it is only by positioning itself as the rightful, sovereign government of the Haida Nation and its homeland of Haida Gwaii that it can adequately care for the islands and protect them from external threat. ((ul))And the continuing advance of the Enbridge project despite fierce opposition from CHN((/ul)), the Old Massett Village Council, ((ul))their Haida constituents, and the non-Haida actors with whom they are “united against Enbridge”((/ul)) (and this alongside protest all over the northwest coast) ((ul))gives the nightmare futures of environmental collapse – pushed through by corporate interests and Canadian politicians - a frightening immanence. The assertion of the openness of the future is made, in short, ((/ul))((ul))in (and against) a context in which closures remain endemic((/ul)). ((ul))And yet, something has ((/ul))((ul))changed((/ul))((ul)) in this landscape from the initial erasures of Native futurity((/ul)) we drew out in the first chapter. ((ul))In the narratives of colonial actors((/ul)) like Duncan Campbell Scott, ((ul))it was absolutely clear that “Indians” were disappearing because their social worlds were being superseded by more “civilized” ways of living and being, ones that these Native subjects would also, inevitably, in the end, adopt (or failing that, perish outright). There was a future. It was ((/ul))((ul))simply a settler one((/ul))((ul)). ((/ul))((ul))But the nightmare futures of that my Haida interlocutors ward against in their own future-making reach beyond Haida life alone((/ul))((ul)). ((/ul))((ul))Environmental collapse((/ul))((ul)), most dramatically, ((/ul))((ul))threatens the sustainability of all life((/ul))((ul)); toxins in the land and the waters threaten human lives regardless of their relative indigeneity, race, or gender((/ul)) (e.g. Choy 2011; Crate 2011). Put another way, ((ul))the ((/ul))((ul))impetus((/ul))((ul)) for non-Haida (and ((/ul))((ul))non-First Nations((/ul))((ul)) subjects more generally) to be “united against Enbridge” with their indigenous neighbours comes in no small part ((/ul))((ul))because((/ul))((ul)) an oil spill also profoundly threatens the lives and livelihoods of ((/ul))((ul))non-Aboriginal((/ul))((ul)) coastal residents((/ul)), a fact which Masa Takei, among others, made clear in Chapter 3. Nor is the anxiety that young people might abandon their small town to pursue economic and educational advantage in an urban context limited to reserve communities. Instead, the compulsions of capitalist economic life compel such migrations throughout the globe. ((ul))((hl))The ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))nightmare futures((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) that Haida people constitute alternative futures to ward against ((/ul))((ul))((hl))are ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))not just future of indigenous erasure under settler colonialism((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)). They are ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))erasures of settler society itself((/hl))((/ul)). ((ul))There is thus an ((/ul))((ul))extraordinary political claim((/ul))((ul)) embedded in Haida future-making, a claim which ((/ul))((ul))gains its power precisely ((/ul))((ul))because((/ul))((ul)) Haida future-making as we have seen it does not (perhaps ((/ul))((ul))cannot((/ul))((ul))) ((/ul))((ul))escape from the larger field of settler-colonial determination((/ul))((ul)). Instead, in Haida future-making we find the implicit assertion that Haida people can make futures that ((/ul))((ul))address the dilemmas of Haida ((/ul))((ul))and((/ul))((ul)) settler life alike((/ul))((ul)), ones that can ((/ul))((ul))at least “navigate((/ul))((ul)),”((/ul)) to borrow Appadurai’s phrasing, ((ul))towards possible futures that do not end in absolute erasure((/ul))((ul)). If((/ul)) Povinelli and Byrd are correct and ((ul))settler liberal governance makes itself possible and legitimate through a perpetual deferral of the problems of the present, then part of the power of Haida future-making is to ((/ul))((ul))expose the threatening non-futures that might emerge out of this bracketed present((/ul))((ul)), to expose as lie the liberal promise of a good life always yet to come and to attempt to constitute alternatives((/ul)). It is no coincidence that we find this in the midst of a struggle over sovereignty. And this not just in the sense of the Council of the Haida Nation’s ongoing assertion of its sovereign right to govern the lands and waters of Haida Gwaii on behalf of all Haida people, as we saw in Chapter 5. Rather, as Joanne Barker has argued, over the course of the latter half of the twentieth century sovereignty has emerged as a: particularly valued term within indigenous scholarship and social movements and through the media of cultural production. It [is] a term around which analyses of indigenous histories and cultures were organized and whereby indigenous activists articulate their agendas for social change (Barker 2005:18). Through the assertion of sovereignty, indigenous political leaders, activists and scholars refute “the dominant notion that indigenous people [are] merely one among many ‘minority groups’ under the administration of state social service and welfare programs.” Instead, “sovereignty defines indigenous people with concrete rights to self-government, territorial integrity, and cultural autonomy under international law” (18). The trouble is, of course, that indigenous claims to sovereignty are always made within the context of colonial nation-states, ones whose own legitimacy is put at considerably risk both by the prospect of self-determining indigenous Nations (re)-emerging within their boundaries and the troubling of their own historical narratives of sovereign rights (cf: Comaroff and Comaroff 2003b). (One of these narratives, which reinterpreted indigenous lands as terra nullius and thus open to occupation, we’ve encountered already in Chapter 3). Thus, while sovereignty might indeed “define” indigenous peoples with concrete rights to territorial Title and self-determination, in theory equal under international law to the states who also lay claim to their territories, that definition does not in and of itself make possible the practice of this sovereignty. In this regard settler states such as Canada have shifted in their response to First Peoples’ sovereignty claims from outright rejection to a set of policies of selective recognition,5 but even the latter still positions Native nations as being subject to the authority and oversight (if not the structural forms) of the state. This means, as we have seen in Chapter 5, that indigenous governments such as the Council of the Haida Nation are in a precarious position, attempting to constitute their own sovereign authority without access to many of the conventional means of sovereignty in Western political thought – e.g., the monopoly on legitimate violence (Weber 1946), decisive authority to make and enact law (Schmitt 2005), or exclusive territorial control (Brown 2010; cf: Hobbes 1994). Alongside this precarity is the equally anxious question of whether or not sovereignty is even an appropriate analytical to center indigenous rights around precisely because it is historically a Western concept, one that had been drawn on to dispossess indigenous peoples over the course of settler colonial history (Barker 2005:18–19). (Indeed, the very next essay in Barker’s edited volume, by Mohawk scholar Taiake Alfred, categorically rejects sovereignty as an inappropriate tool for indigenous political assertions for these reasons and, also, because it draws attention away from developing and furthering “genuinely” Aboriginal political modes of thought (Alfred 2005; cf: Alfred 2009). The fact that sovereignty remains such a preeminent concept in the struggle for indigenous rights even though it is both epistemologically problematic and politically constrained has meant that there has been a recent push in both anthropology and indigenous studies to “widen” the definition of sovereignty, so that it might encompass multiple forms of indigenous social, political and legal practice outside of the conventional purview of “sovereign power” (e.g. Cattelino 2008; Richland 2011; Simpson 2000; Simpson 2014). Or, as Joanne Barker puts it: There is no fixed meaning for what sovereignty is – what it means by definition, what it implies in public debate, or how it has been conceptualized in international, nation, or indigenous law. Sovereignty – and its related histories, perspectives, and identities – is embedded within the specific social relations in which it is invoked and given meaning. How and when it emerges and functions are determined by the “located” political agendas and cultural perspectives of those who rearticulate it into public debate or political document to do a specific work of opposition, invitation, or accommodation. It is no more possible to stabilize what sovereignty means and how it matters to those who invoke it than it is to forget the historical and cultural embeddedness of indigenous peoples’ multiple and contradictory political perspectives and agendas for empowerment, decolonization, and social justice (Barker 2005:21, emphasis original). The opening up of sovereignty as flexible, multiple, and subject to all manner of diverse rearticulations carries particular weight (and, perhaps, ambiguity) since, as a historical concept in Western political theory, sovereignty was overwhelmingly concerned with closure. As Wendy Brown argues in her Walled States, Waning Sovereignty, the classic vision of sovereign power rests in the capacity to divide the inside from the outside, to make borders around a people – a “nation” – and separate that people from those outside it. Thus Schmitt’s “friend-enemy” distinction, for instance, or even John Locke’s consistent preoccupation with fences as a way of marking the existence of territory (Brown 2010; cf: Schmitt 1996; Locke 1988). The historical conditions of indigenous sovereignty claims in the context of settler colonialism make such absolute closures impossible for indigenous peoples. We might add, though, that their persistent presence also challenges the closure of the settler nation-state. Indeed, this is part of Brown’s point. The very fact that we see ever more spectacular performances of sovereign power on the part of contemporary nation-states – e.g., the titular “walls” that are being constructed along the borders of an increasing number of states - is a sign of the very insecurity of their political authority (Brown 2010).6 ((ul))The conditions of settler colonial sovereignty, in other words, may be rather more “open,” and thus closer to those of indigenous “nation-within-nations,” then they may at first appear. If this means, in turn, that the future of settler political life is becoming as uncertain as the future for indigenous life has always been since the advent of settlement, then this means only what we have ((/ul))((ul))already begun to see: the dilemmas that Haida people confront in their future-making practices are also the dilemmas facing settler society((/ul)). Take Chapter 4, in which the absence of any “one” definitive governing entity compels the constitution of an aspirational framework of accountability which could, were it realized, render navigable Haida relations to the many governments that claim their loyalties. As I hinted at there, such dilemmas are not restricted to the Haida sociopolitical world; rather, they may in fact be endemic to contemporary democratic societies and the multiple forms of governance (licit and otherwise) that emerge therein. ((ul))In suggesting that there are Haida ways of refiguring a shared Haida-settler set of contemporary problematics, we might think of Haida future-making as simultaneously an instantiation of the multiple, flexible and always contingently located practices of sovereignty((/ul)) to which Barker points ((ul))and a different way of thinking about indigenous political potentiality. In the former sense, Haida future-making is without doubt concerned with carving out spaces in which Haida existence can continue, expand, and change without losing the capacity to reproduce itself as, precisely, Haida existence((/ul)). Thus the processes of homecoming we explored in Chapter 2, or Chapter 5’s explicitly political attempts to establish control over the islands for future generations. If the absence of indigenous sovereignty is the absence of the capacity of an indigenous people to (self)-determine their own futures, then the constitution of Haida futures can be seen exactly as sovereign work, whether in the overt sense of the Council of the Haida Nation’s assertions or the somewhat more implicit mode of Alice Stevens’ proposed mass adoptions. ((ul))Significant here, though, is the fact that these ((/ul))((ul))acts of future-making carry meanings beyond their status as “responses” to the social and political dilemmas of contemporary Haida life((/ul)). Thus Alice Stevens’ adoptions bring “hippie” children into the framework of Haida kinship relations, in one sense neutralizing their potential threat, but also ((ul))constituting a complex new network of social relations between Haida and non-Haida whose potential significances go well beyond the protection of Haida territory and resources((/ul)); thus the Council of the Haida Nation emerges as a “state-like” governing entity through its authorizing promise to “take care” of the islands, but in so doing takes on a series of new roles in Haida political life whose full consequences remain to be seen. ((ul))If it is a sovereign action to envision an opening of possible futures for Haida people, then this very openness might also exceed the boundaries of sovereignty as a problematic for indigenous people even as it responds to them. Which is also, perhaps, why Haida futures seem so consistently to sketch out social, ecological, and political fields that encompass non-Haida; more, that are futures for Canada as well as for the Haida people living within the nation-state’s borders. Or, at least, futures that have the capacity to be so((/ul)). ((ul))What would it mean to figure an indigenous sovereignty that speaks beyond itself, one that ((/ul))((ul))promises to invert the order of settler domination through reconfiguring the shared futures of indigenous and settler peoples((/ul))((ul))?((/ul)) ((ul))This would not be a sovereignty premised on territorial closure, or even absolute political autonomy. It would, however, decisively overturn any settler colonial anticipations of the inevitable erasure of Native peoples. Quite the opposite, it would position indigenous practices of anticipation, aspiration, certainty, and anxiety at the forefront of contemporary modes of political imagination((/ul)). Unsettling Futures ((ul))A question remains, however. Could ((/ul))((ul))such a refiguring of the temporal and political horizon of settler and indigenous relationships remain possible even if the futures that indigenous people work to constitute remain unrealized in the settler colonial present((/ul))((ul))?((/ul)) Or, put another way, we must always be careful not to conflate a capacity to form new futures for settler nation-states with the actual materializations of these futures. ((ul))The Haida futures that I have discussed, even as they promise possible ways of navigating – of restructuring, even – the settler-Haida present, remain firmly bound by the colonial constraints of this present. But perhaps the stakes here have ((/ul))((ul))never been about overthrowing the((/ul)) Canadian ((ul))colonial order outright((/ul))((ul)). Rather((/ul)), what I hope this dissertation has shown is that ((ul))Haida future-making ((/ul))((ul))has the capacity to ((/ul))((ul))unsettle((/ul))((ul)) the settler colonial present((/ul))((ul)), to challenge its received categories and demonstrate how, slowly, gradually, Haida people are reconfiguring its terms through the work of producing the future((/ul)). Certainly, the sheer fact of Haida futurity should put to the lie any further notion that Haida people exist only to replicate their past or live only in the deferral of their eventual disappearance. The future is alive and well in Old Massett, although this does not meant that it is not also a site of profound anxieties. ((ul))In working to ward off((/ul)) those ((ul))anxieties through the juxtaposition of nightmare futures against their more desirable alternatives, then, Haida people unsettle the epistemological foundations of((/ul)) the ((ul))forms of settler colonialism and liberalism((/ul)) against which Byrd and Povinelli write. ((ul))At the same time((/ul)) (if you’ll pardon the pun), I think ((ul))we can see the social work that futuremaking does iteratively, as a gradual reshaping of the actual conditions of((/ul)) Canadian ((ul))society((/ul)). Here I borrow Judith Butler’s suggestion, following Foucault, that the regulatory norms of society function only through their consistent and unstable reiteration (and materialization) in everyday social life.7 From this perspective, ((ul))the ways in which Haida people ((/ul))((ul))work within and even reiterate the constraints and demands of((/ul)) Canadian ((ul))settler mainstream society((/ul))((ul)) can ((/ul))((ul))also slowly and strategically ((/ul))((ul))shift((/ul))((ul)) those very constraints and demands, materializing a((/ul)) HaidaCanadian ((ul))future that might in fact be quite different from the present even as it does not ever fully “escape” from its dilemmas((/ul)). Perhaps ((ul))the most unsettling potential of all here lies simply in the ways in which Haida people ((/ul))((ul))incorporate the conditions of the settler colonial present as being paths towards Haida futures((/ul))((ul)). Not vanished, or vanquished. Ongoing((/ul)).

In particular, Erik Gartzke, Quan Li & Charles Boehmer (2001), henceforth referred to as GLB, have demonstrated that ((ul))measures of capital openness have a substantial and ((/ul))((ul))statistically significant association with peaceful((/ul))((ul)) dyadic relations((/ul)). Gartzke (2007((ul))) confirms that this association is robust to a large variety of model specifications. ((/ul))To explain this correlation, GLB propose that countries ((ul))with ((/ul))((ul))((hl))open ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))capital ((/ul))((ul))((hl))markets((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) are more able to credibly ((/ul))((ul))((hl))signal((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) their ((/ul))((ul))((hl))resolve through((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))the bearing of greater ((/ul))((ul))((hl))economic costs prior to((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) the outbreak of ((/ul))((ul))((hl))militarized conflict((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). ((/ul))This explanation is novel and plausible, and resonates with the rationalist view of asymmetric information as a cause of conflict (Fearon, 1995). Moreover, it implies clear testable predictions on evidential domains different from those examined by GLB. In this article ((ul))we exploit this opportunity by constructing a confirmatory test of GLB((/ul))((ul))’s theory of ((/ul))((ul))market-mediated signaling((/ul))((ul)). We first develop an innovative quantitative case selection technique to identify crucial cases where the mechanism of market-mediated signaling should be most easily observed((/ul)). Specifically, we employ quantitative data and the statistical models used to support the theory we are probing to create an impartial and transparentmeans of selecting cases in which the theory – as specified by the theory’s creators –makes its most confident predictions.We implement three different case selection rules to select cases that optimize on two criteria: (1) maximizing the inferential leverage of our cases, and (2) minimizing selection bias. We examine these cases for a necessary implication of market-mediated signaling: that key participants drew a connection between conflictual events and adverse market movements. Such an inference is a necessary step in the process by which market-mediated costs can signal resolve. For evidence of this we examine news media, government documents, memoirs, historical works, and other sources. We additionally examine other sources, such as market data, for evidence that economic costs were caused by escalatory events. Based on this analysis, we assess the evidence for GLB’s theory of market mediated costly signaling. Our article then considers a more complex heterogeneous effects version of market-mediated signaling in which unspecified scope conditions are required for the mechanism to operate. Our design has the feature of selecting cases in which scope conditions are most likely to be absent. This allows us to perform an exploratory analysis of these cases, looking for possible scope conditions. We also consider alternative potential mechanisms. Our cases are reviewed in more detail in the online appendix.1 To summarize our results, ((ul))our confirmatory test finds that while ((/ul))((ul))market-mediated signaling may be operative in the most serious disputes, it was largely absent in the less serious disputes ((/ul))((ul))that characterize most of the sample of militarized interstate disputes ((/ul))(MIDs). ((ul))This suggests either that other mechanisms account for the correlation between capital openness and peace, or that the scope conditions for market-mediated signaling are restrictive((/ul)). Of the signals that we observed, ((ul))strategic ((/ul))((ul))((hl))market((/hl))((/ul))((ul))-mediated ((/ul))((ul))((hl))signals were ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))relatively more ((/ul))((ul))((hl))important ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))than automatic market-mediated signals ((/ul))((ul))((hl))in ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))the most ((/ul))((ul))((hl))serious conflicts((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) ((ul))We identify((/ul)) a number of potential scope conditions, such as that (1) ((ul))the conflict must be driven by bargaining failure arising from uncertainty and (2) the economic costs need to escalate gradually and need to be substantial, but less than the expected military costs of conflict((/ul)). Finally, there were a number of other explanations that seemed present in the cases we examined and could account for the capitalist peace: ((ul))capital openness is associated with greater anticipated economic costs of conflict((/ul)); ((ul))capital openness leads ((/ul))((ul))third parties((/ul))((ul)) to have a greater stake in the conflict and therefore be more willing to intervene; ((/ul))a dyadic acceptance of the status quo could promote both peace and capital openness; and countries seeking to institutionalize a regional peace might instrumentally harness the pacifying effects of liberal markets. The correlation: Open capital markets and peace The empirical puzzle at the core of this article is the significant and robust correlation noted by GLB between high levels of capital openness in both members of a dyad and the infrequent incidence of militarized interstate disputes (MIDs) and wars between the members of this dyad (Gartzke, Li & Boehmer, 2001). The index of capital openness (CAPOPEN) is intended to capture the ‘difficulty states face in seeking to impose restrictions on capital flows (the degree of lost policy autonomy due to globalization)’ (Gartzke & Li, 2003: 575). CAPOPEN is constructed from data drawn from the widely used IMF’s Annual Reports on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Controls; it is a combination of eight binary variables that measure different types of government restrictions on capital and currency flow (Gartzke, Li & Boehmer, 2001: 407). The measure of CAPOPEN starts in 1966 and is defined for many countries (increasingly more over time). Most of the countries that do not have a measure of CAPOPEN are communist.2 GLB implement this variable in a dyadic framework by creating a new variable, CAPOPENL, which is the smaller of the two dyadic values of CAPOPEN. This operationalization is sometimes referred to as the ‘weak-link’ specification since the functional form is consonant with a model of war in which the ‘weakest link’ in a dyad determines the probability of war. CAPOPENL has a negative monotonic association with the incidence of MIDs, fatal MIDs, and wars (see Figure 1).3 The strength of the estimated empirical association between peace and CAPOPENL, using a modified version of the dataset and model from Gartzke (2007), is comparable to that between peace and, respectively, joint democracy, log of distance, or the GDP of a contiguous dyad (Gartzke, 2007: 179; Gartzke, Li & Boehmer, 2001: 412). In summary, CAPOPENL seems to be an important and robust correlate of peace. The question of why specifically this correlation exists, however, remains to be answered. The mechanism: Market-mediated signaling? Gartzke, Li & Boehmer (2001) argue that the classic liberal account for the pacific effect of economic interdependence – that interdependence increases the expected costs of war – is not consistent with the bargaining theory of war (see also Morrow, 1999). GLB argue that ‘conventional descriptions of interdependence see war as less likely because states face additional opportunity costs for fighting. The problem with such an account is that it ignores incentives to capitalize on an opponent’s reticence to fight’ (Gartzke, Li & Boehmer, 2001: 400.)4 Instead, GLB (see also Gartzke, 2003; Gartzke & Li, 2003) argue ((ul))that financial interdependence could promote peace by facilitating the sending of ((/ul))((ul))costly signals((/ul))((ul)). As the probability of militarized conflict increases, states incur a variety of automatic and strategically imposed economic costs as a consequence of escalation toward conflict.((/ul)) ((ul))Those states that persist in a dispute despite these costs will reveal their willingness to tolerate them, and ((/ul))((ul))hence signal resolve((/ul)). ((ul))The greater the degree of economic interdependence, the more a resolved country could demonstrate its willingness to suffer costs ex ante to militarized conflict. ((/ul))Gartzke, Li & Boehmer’s mechanism implies a commonly perceived costly signal before militarized conflict breaks out or escalates: if market-mediated signaling is to account for the correlation between CAPOPENL and the absence of MIDs, then visible market-mediated costs should occur prior to or during periods of real or potential conflict (Gartzke, Li & Boehmer, 2001). Thus, the proposed mechanism should leave many visible footprints in the historical record. ((ul))This theory predicts that these visible signals must arise in any escalating conflict, involving countries with high capital openness, in which this mechanism is operative ((/ul))Clarifying the signaling mechanism Gartzke, Li & Boehmer’s signaling mechanism is mostly conceptualized on an abstract, game-theoretic level (Gartzke, Li & Boehmer, 2001). In order to elucidate the types of observations that could inform this theory’s validity, we discuss with greater specificity the possible ways in which such signaling might occur. ((ul))A conceptual classification of costly signals The term signaling connotes an intentional communicative act by one party directed towards another((/ul)). Because the term signaling thus suggests a willful act, and ((ul))((hl))a signal of resolve is only credible if it is costly((/hl))((/ul))((hl)),((/hl)) ((ul))scholars have sometimes concluded that states involved in bargaining under incomplete information could advance their interests by imposing costs on themselves and thereby signaling their resolve((/ul)) (e.g. Lektzian & Sprecher, 2007). However, the game-theoretic concept of signaling refers more generally to any situation in which an actor’s behavior reveals information about her private information. In fact, ((ul))states frequently adopt sanctions with low costs to themselves and high costs to their rivals because doing so is often a rational bargaining tactic on other grounds: they are trying to coerce their rival to concede the issue.((/ul)) ((ul))Bargaining encounters of this type can be conceptualized as a type of war-of-attrition game in which each ((/ul))((ul))actor attempts to coerce the other through the imposition of escalating costs((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) ((ul))Such encounters also provide the opportunity for signaling: when states resist the costs imposed by their rivals, ((/ul))((ul))they ((/ul))((ul))‘signal’ their resolve. ((/ul))If at some point one party perceives the conflict to have become too costly and steps back, that party ‘signals’ a lack of resolve. Thus, ((ul))this kind of signaling arises as a by-product of another((/ul))((ul))’s coercive attempts.((/ul)) In other words, costly signals come in two forms: self-inflicted (information about a leader arising from a leader’s intentional or incidental infliction of costs on himself) or imposed (information about a leader that arises from a leader’s response to a rival’s imposition of costs). Additionally, ((ul))costs may arise as an automatic byproduct of escalation towards military ((/ul))((ul))((hl))conflict((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) or may be a tool of statecraft that is strategically ((/ul))((ul))((hl))employ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))ed during a conflict.((/ul)) The automatic mechanism stipulates that as the probability of conflict increases, ((ul))various economic assets will ((/ul))((ul))((hl))lose value((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) due to the risk of conflict ((/ul))((ul))((hl))and investor flight((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). ((/ul))However, the occurrence of these costs may also be intentional outcomes of specific escalatory decisions of the states, as in the case of deliberate sanctions; in this case they are strategic. ((ul))Finally, at a practical level, we identify three different potential kinds of economic costs of militarized conflict ((/ul))that may be mediated by open capital markets: ((ul))capital costs from political risk, monetary coercion, and business sanctions.((/ul)) T"],"stats":{"highlightedWords":46}},{"tag":"Only cap solves the environment with Green Capitalism ","cite":"Graciela 16 – Professor of Economics and of Statistics at Columbia University and Visiting Professor at Stanford University, and was the architect of the Kyoto Protocol carbon market (being interviewed by Marcus Rolle, freelance journalist specializing in environmental issues and global affairs, “Reversing Climate Change: Interview with Graciela Chichilnisky,” http://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/blog/01/09/2016/reversing-climate-change-interview-graciela-chichilnisky)//cmr ","text":["GC: Green capitalism is a new economic system that values the natural resources on which human survival depends.

In a nutshell ((ul))Green Capitalism requires the creation of ((/ul))global limits or ((ul))property rights nation by nation for the use of the atmosphere, ((/ul))the bodies of water and the planet’s biodiversity, ((ul))and the creation of new markets to trade these rights((/ul)) from which new economic values and a new concept of economic progress emerges updating GDP as is now generally agreed is needed.

The Carbon Market and its CDM play critical roles in the foundation of Green Capitalism, creating values to redefine GDP.

As I see it, ((ul))the ((/ul))((ul))building blocks((/ul))((ul)) for Green Capitalism are((/ul)) then as follows; (1) ((ul))Global limits nation by nation((/ul)) in the use of the planet’s atmosphere, its water bodies and biodiversity - these are global public goods.

These building blocks have immediate practical implications in reversing climate change and can assist the ambitious aims of Paris COP21 become a reality. MR: What is the greatest advantage of the ((ul))new generation tech((/ul))nologies that ((ul))can capture CO2 from the air((/ul))? GC: These technologies build carbon negative power plants, such as Global Thermostat, that clean the atmosphere of CO2 while producing electricity. Global Thermostat is a firm that is commercializing a technology that takes CO2 out of air and uses mostly low cost residual heat rather than electricity to drive the capture process, making the entire process of capturing CO2 from the atmosphere very inexpensive. There is enough residua heat in a coal power plant that it can be used to capture twice as much CO2 as the plant emits, thus transforming the power plant into a “carbon sink.” For example, ((ul))a 400 MW ((/ul))((ul))((hl))coal plant ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))that emits 1 million tons of CO2 per year ((/ul))((ul))((hl))can((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) become a carbon sink ((/ul))((ul))((hl))absorb((/hl))((/ul))((ul))ing a net amount of ((/ul))((ul))((hl))1 million tons((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) of CO2 instead((/ul)). ((ul))Carbon capture from air can be done anywhere and at any time, and so inexpensively that the CO2 can be sold for industrial or commercial uses such as plastics, food and beverages, greenhouses, bio-fertilizers, building materials and even enhanced oil recovery((/ul)), all examples of large global markets and profitable opportunities. Carbon capture is powered mostly by low (85°C) residual heat that is inexpensive, and any source will do. In particular, renewable (solar) technology can power the process of carbon capture. This can help advance solar technology and make it more cost-efficient. ((ul))This means more energy, more jobs, and it also means economic growth in developing nations, all of this while cleaning the CO2 in the atmosphere. Carbon negative tech((/ul))nologies ((ul))can literally transform the world economy((/ul)). MR: One final question. You distinguish between long-run and short-run strategies in the effort to reverse climate change. Would carbon negative technologies be part of a short-run strategy? GC: Long-run strategies are quite different from strategies for the short-run. Often ((ul))((hl))long-run strategies do not work ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))in the short run((/ul)) and different policies and ((ul))((hl))economic incentives are needed((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) In the long run the best climate change policy is to replace fossil fuel sources of energy that by themselves cause 45% of the global emissions, and to plant trees to restore if possible the natural sources and sinks of CO2. But ((ul))the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))fossil fuel((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) power plant ((/ul))((ul))((hl))infrastructure is((/hl))((/ul)) about ((ul))((hl))87%((/hl))((/ul)) ((ul))of the power plant infrastructure and about $45-55 trillion ((/ul))((ul))((hl))globally.((/hl))((/ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((ul))((hl))This((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) infrastructure ((/ul))((ul))((hl))cannot be replaced((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) quickly, ((/ul))((ul))certainly not ((/ul))((ul))((hl))in ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))the short ((/ul))((ul))((hl))time((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) period in which we need ((/ul))((ul))((hl))to((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) take action to ((/ul))((ul))((hl))avert((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) catastrophic ((/ul))((ul))((hl))climate change((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) The issue is that ((ul))CO2 once emitted remains hundreds of years in the atmosphere and we have emitted so much that unless we actually ((/ul))((ul))remove the CO2((/ul))((ul)) that is already there, ((/ul))((ul))we cannot remain((/ul)) long ((ul))within the carbon budget((/ul)), which is the concentration of CO2 beyond which we fear catastrophic climate change. In the short run, therefore, ((ul))we face significant time pressure((/ul)). The ((ul))IPCC indicates((/ul)) in its 2014 5th Assessment Report that ((ul))((hl))we must((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) actually ((/ul))((ul))((hl))remove((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))carbon((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) that is already in the atmosphere((/ul)) and do so ((ul))in massive quantities((/ul)), this century (p. 191 of 5th Assessment Report). ((ul))This is what I called a carbon negative approach,((/ul)) which works for the short run. Renewable energy is the long run solution. ((ul))Renewable energy is too slow for a short run resolution since replacing a $45-55 trillion power plant infrastructure with renewable plants could take ((/ul))((ul))decades((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) ((ul))We need action sooner than that.((/ul)) For the short run we need carbon negative technologies that capture more carbon than what is emitted. Trees do that and they must be conserved to help preserve biodiversity. Biochar does that. But ((ul))trees and other natural sinks are too slow for what we need today.((/ul)) Therefore, negative carbon is needed now as part of a blueprint for transformation. It ((ul))must be part of the blueprint for((/ul)) Sustainable Development and its short term manifestation that I call ((ul))Green Capitalism((/ul)), ((ul))while in the long run renewable sources of energy suffice((/ul)), including Wind, Biofuels, Nuclear, Geothermal, and Hydroelectric energy. ((ul))These are in limited supply and cannot replace fossil fuels((/ul)). ((ul))Global energy today is((/ul)) roughly divided as follows: ((ul))87%((/ul)) is ((ul))fossil((/ul)), namely natural gas, coal, oil; ((ul))10%((/ul)) is ((ul))nuclear, geothermal, and hydroelectric, and less than 1% is solar ((/ul))power — photovoltaic and solar thermal. Nuclear fuel is scarce and nuclear technology is generally considered dangerous as tragically experienced by the Fukushima Daichi nuclear disaster in Japan, and it seems unrealistic to seek a solution in the nuclear direction. Only solar energy can be a long term solution: Less than 1% of the solar energy we receive on earth can be transformed into 10 times the fossil fuel energy used in the world today. Yet ((ul))we need a short-term strategy that accelerates long run renewable energy((/ul)), or we will defeat long-term goals. ((ul))In the short term as the IPCC validates, we need carbon negative tech((/ul))nology, carbon removals. ((ul))The short run is the next 20 or 30 years((/ul)). ((ul))There is no time in this period of time to transform the entire fossil infrastructure((/ul)) — it costs $45-55 trillion (IEA) to replace and it is slow to build. We need to directly reduce carbon in the atmosphere now. We cannot use traditional methods to remove CO2 from smokestacks (called often Carbon Capture and Sequestration, CSS) because they are not carbon negative as is required. CSS works but does not suffice because it only captures what power plants currently emit. Any level of emissions adds to the stable and high concentration we have today and CO2 remains in the atmosphere for years. We need to remove the CO2 that is already in the atmosphere, namely air capture of CO2 also called carbon removals. ((ul))The ((/ul))((ul))((hl))solution is to((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) combine ((/ul))((ul))((hl))air capture of CO2((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))with storage((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) of CO2 into stable materials((/ul)) such as biochar, cement, polymers, and carbon fibers ((ul))that replace((/ul)) a number of ((ul))other((/ul)) construction ((ul))materials((/ul)) such as metals. The most recent BMW automobile model uses only carbon fibers rather than metals. It is also possible to combine CO2 to produce renewable gasoline, namely gasoline produced from air and water. CO2 can be separated from air and hydrogen separated from water, and their combination is a well-known industrial process to produce gasoline. Is this therefore too expensive? There are new technologies using algae that make synthetic fuel commercially feasible at competitive rates. Other policies would involve combining air capture with solar thermal electricity using the residual solar thermal heat to drive the carbon capture process. This can make a solar plant more productive and efficient so it can out-compete coal as a source of energy. In summary, the blueprint offered here is a private/public approach, based on new industrial technology and financial markets, self-funded and using profitable greenmarkets, with securities that utilize carbon credits as the “underlying” asset, based on the KP CDM, as well as new markets for biodiversity and water providing abundant clean energy to stave off impending and actual energy crisis in developing nations, fostering mutually beneficial cooperation for industrial and developing nations. The blueprint proposed provides the two sides of the coin, equity and efficiency, and can assign a critical role for women as stewards for human survival and sustainable development. My vision is a carbon negative economy that represents green capitalism in resolving the Global Climate negotiations and the North–South Divide. Carbon negative power plants and capture of CO2 from air and ensure a clean atmosphere together innovation and more jobs and exports: the more you produce and create jobs the cleaner becomes the atmosphere. In practice, Green Capitalism means economic growth that is harmonious with the Earth resources.

It's also testament to the importance of ((ul))trade((/ul)) in ((ul))transferr((/ul))ing ((ul))technology from developed to developing countries((/ul))—in this case, the technology needed to remove lead from gasoline. This hints at the answer to the question of why some parts of the world have been left behind while the rest of the world has thrived. Why have improvements in well-being stalled in areas such as Sub-Saharan Africa and the Arab world? The proximate cause of improvements in well-being is a “cycle of progress” composed of the mutually reinforcing forces of economic development and technological progress. But that cycle itself is propelled by a web of essential institutions, particularly property rights, free markets, and rule of law. Other important institutions would include science- and technology-based problem-solving founded on skepticism and experimentation; receptiveness to new  technologies and ideas; and freer trade in goods, services—most importantly in knowledge and ideas. In short, free and open societies prosper. Isolation, intolerance, and hostility to the free exchange of knowledge, technology, people, and goods breed stagnation or regression. Despite all of this progress and good news, then, there is still much unfinished business. Millions of people die from hunger, malnutrition, and preventable disease such as malaria, tuberculosis, and diarrhea. Over a billion people still live in absolute poverty, defined as less than a dollar per day. A third of the world’s eligible population is still not enrolled in secondary school. ((ul))Barriers to globalization, economic development, and technological change((/ul))—such as the use of DDT to eradicate malaria, genetic engineering, and biotechnology—((ul))are a big source of the problem((/ul)). Moreover, the global population will grow 50 percent to 100 percent this century, and per capita consumption of energy and materials will likely increase with wealth. Merely preserving the status quo is not enough. We need to protect the important sustaining institutions responsible for all of this progress in the developed world, and we need to foster and nurture them in countries that are still developing.  Man’s remarkable progress over the last 100 years is unprecedented in human history. It’s also one of the more neglected big-picture stories. ((ul))((hl))Ensuring ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))that our incredible ((/ul))((ul))((hl))progress continues will require((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) not only recognizing and appreciating the progress itself, but also recognizing and ((/ul))((ul))((hl))preserving the ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))important ideas and ((/ul))((ul))((hl))institutions that caused it((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), and ensuring that they endure((/ul)).

Beyond a few fundamentals—that ((ul))it ((/ul))((ul))((hl))puts faith in markets as the best way to allocate resources((/hl))((/ul)), that it depends on private ownership of property, that((ul)) it features mechanisms for accumulating capital to fund endeavors larger than individuals can undertake alone—very little about it is set in stone((/ul)). This is why we often hear phrases suggesting different styles of capitalism: “capitalism with Chinese characteristics,” for example, or “Northern European social capitalism.” No surprise, then, that ((ul))((hl))capitalism ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))is subject to change((/ul)). And what’s behind that change? Again, ((ul))at the theoretical level, it’s easy to surmise. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Like any adaptive system((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)), ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))capitalism is nested in an environment, so any substantial change in that environment ((/ul))((ul))((hl))alters what it takes to thrive((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). It’s the same basic phenomenon as in nature:((/ul)) when the insect population of the Galapagos moves on to new flowers with a different shape, the beaks of the finches evolve in turn. That the environment of global commerce is undergoing major change is no secret. ((ul))Advancing technology, for one thing, constantly reinvents the context in which commerce operates. Demographics, too, have an effect, as the generations raised with new technological capabilities begin to fill positions of power.((/ul)) Most strikingly, the very geography of capitalism is shifting. ((ul))With each passing year, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))emerging economies account for a larger ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))proportion of global ((/ul))((ul))((hl))GDP;((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) from 2004 to 2009, they accounted for ((/ul))((ul))((hl))almost all ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))of the world’s((/ul))((ul))((hl)) GDP growth((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). Patterns of consumption are being upended as ((/ul))((ul))((hl))global standards of liv­ing rise((/hl))((/ul))((ul));((/ul)) India’s middle class is now bigger than the entire U.S. popula­tion. Americans and others in the developed world have long fretted about job losses and other social implications of this huge and ongo­ing shift. But the impact of emerging economies will go beyond what anyone is talking about. It isn’t simply that ((ul))capitalism((/ul)) will increasingly happen elsewhere. It’s that, ((ul))taking root in different soil, capitalism itself will grow into something new.((/ul)) Capitalism doesn’t evolve only in theory. ((ul))The most cursory review of economic history shows how much it has changed in practice. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))The rules shift constantly((/hl))((/ul)). For example, when Great Britain was the epicen­ter of industrial capitalism, it was understood that a business founder who borrowed capital and then went belly-up should be shipped off to debtor’s prison—or worse, Texas (before air-conditioning). But U.S.((ul)) ((/ul))((ul))((hl))capitalists((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) more disposed to second chances later ((/ul))((ul))((hl))rewrote((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) those ((/ul))((ul))((hl))rules((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), creating bankruptcy laws that encouraged entrepreneurial risk taking. The system morphed again with the introduction of limited liability, which allowed firms to shoulder the risk of large-scale manu­facturing((/ul)) and, in doing so, gave rise to monopolies (an eventuality no one had worried about before). Even rock-solid assumptions—such as the assumption that currencies must be backed by precious metals—have been tossed aside as trade marches on. These are only a few, top-of-mind examples of ideas that cropped up locally, took hold, and changed capitalism globally. At a more fundamental level, when production shifted from agri­culture to industrial production, the theories of economics changed profoundly, because financial capital gradually overtook land in impor­tance. As information—inherently not a scarce resource—becomes the most productive resource, economics will change again. We’re convinced therefore that we’re on firm ground with our thesis: capitalism evolves, and even now it is evolving into something new. The question is, Into what? To know that, it’s necessary to question some seemingly central capitalist aims—because it was the old environment that gave rise to them—and look at things from a new vantage point. That is why we call our book “standing on the sun”—a reference to taking a new perspective. The phrase comes courtesy of Richard Morley, an MIT physicist who has made so many original contributions that a prize awarded by the Society of Manufacturing Engineers has been named for him. Once in a conversation about how innovation happens, Morley said to Chris, “In order to see the solar system as it is, Copernicus had to be standing on the sun.” Morley meant to underscore how hard it is reexamine a model in which you are situated and one that you believe to be working quite well. Standing on Earth, it was easy for pre-Renaissance scholars to believe they occupied the center of the universe and to persist in believing so even as evidence mounted that should have compelled them to rethink that position. As the instruments used to study the night sky became more and more powerful and as astronomers began to communicate across larger distances and share their observations, that central assumption forced their calculations into contortions. Planets showed themselves to be capable of anomalous retrograde movements, frequently deviating from the paths that mathemati­cians had plotted. But rather than question the basic model, astrono­mers added layers of complexity to it, positing epicycles and deferents within orbits—whatever it took to give their geocentric model the power to predict the movement of heavenly bodies. Then came Copernicus’ hypothesis, and workings that had seemed impossibly complicated suddenly became elegant. By analogy((ul)), ((/ul))((ul))((hl))today’s capitalists ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))look around them, see anomalies, and struggle to incorporate them into the model they have embraced as true.((/ul)) What are some of the messy parts being shoehorned into this Ptolemaic version of capitalism? ((ul))The value of ((/ul))((ul))((hl))corporate social respon­sibility((/hl))((/ul)) (CSR), for one thing, is an idea few can bring themselves to deny but one that clashes uncomfortably with theories of capital mar­kets. ((ul))((hl))Open source initiatives((/hl))((/ul))((ul)),((/ul)) for another, seem to flout all the phys­ics of economic motivation but continue to gain force. Still another anomaly: ((ul))((hl))venture philanthropy((/hl))((/ul)), which can’t be reconciled with the laws of profit pursuit. Nonetheless, happening. Our argument is that, with a shift in perspective, ((ul))((hl))such phenomena((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) cease to seem aberrant and instead ((/ul))((ul))((hl))align with the logic of the system((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) It requires only a belief that ((ul))capitalism can evolve and center on new pursuits((/ul)). Imagine, for example, that something most people con­sider to be the core of capitalism—competition—is actually not so central. Shift your vantage point so that innovation holds that pride of place, and suddenly initiatives like Wikipedia don’t seem so unlikely. ((ul))((hl))Competition,((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) still very much part of the system but ((/ul))((ul))((hl))unseated from its central point, moves over to ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))allow for collaboration((/hl))((/ul)). Likewise, what if the pursuit of financial gain is not really the heart, much less the soul, of capitalism? What if it’s really centered on the pursuit of value? That’s a formulation that, again, does not reject financial profitability but allows it to sit easily beside the pursuit of other kinds of gains."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":82}},{"tag":"Capitalism makes war less likely through different avenues of competition.","cite":"Gartzke 7 (Eric, associate professor of political science and a member of the Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies at Columbia University, “The Capitalist Peace”, American Journal of Political Science, Vol. 51, No. 1, January 2007, Pp. 166–191)","text":["If ((ul))((hl))war is a product of incompatible interests((/hl))((/ul)) and failed or abortive bargaining, ((ul))((hl))peace ensues when states lack differences worthy of ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))costly ((/ul))((ul))((hl))conflic((/hl))((/ul))((hl))t,((/hl)) or when circumstances favor successful diplomacy.

In the long run he sees technology as a bridge, a bridge we humans must cross with great care, in order to reach new and better modes of being. In his work, Bostrom uses the tools of philosophy and mathematics, in particular probability theory, to try and determine how we as a species might achieve this safe passage. What follows is my conversation with Bostrom about some of the most interesting and worrying existential risks that humanity might encounter in the decades and centuries to come, and about what we can do to make sure we outlast them.¶ Some have argued that we ought to be directing our resources toward humanity's existing problems, rather than future existential risks, because many of the latter are highly improbable.

Recent South African police statistics also show that levels of rape are often highest in provinces which are economically less developed. The reasons for this relationship between violence against women and poverty are numerous. apartheid's economic exploitation and segregation systematically resulted in much higher levels of poverty for black South Africans and women in particular. A range of factors have contributed to high levels of violence against women in poor areas. These factors include transiency of the population, over-crowding, disrupted family life, a mentality of dependency and the socialised acceptance of violence as a way to solve problems.

((ul))It must guard against atomisation and recover its transformative aspirations to shape the new social order((/ul)) that is hovering on the horizon, says Rahila Gupta¶ How should feminists read our current times? A major economic crisis rocks the developed world. While austerity measures don’t appear to be working across Europe, the mildly Keynesian efforts of Obama to kick-start the US economy have had only a marginal effect. The Occupy movement has gone global and the public disorder in the summer, with more disorder being predicted by the police, are an indication of deep discontent with the system. Yet we have seen an enthusiastic and vibrant third wave of youthful feminism emerge in the past decade. At the rate at which these waves arise, it will be some time before the rock of patriarchy will be worn smooth.¶ The current phase of capitalism – neo-liberalism – which began with Thatcher and Reagan in the 1970s, promotes privatisation and deregulation in order to safeguard the freedom of the individual to compete and consume without interference from a bloated state. According to David Harvey, a Marxist academic, the world stumbled towards neo-liberalism in response to the last major recession in the 70s when ‘the uneasy compact between capital and labour brokered by an interventionist state’ broke down. The UK government, for example, was obliged by the International Monetary Fund to cut expenditure on the welfare state in order to balance the books. The post-war settlement had given labour more than its due, and it was time for the upper classes to claw these gains back. ¶ The fact that second wave feminism and neoliberalism flourished from the 1970s onwards has led some to argue, notably Nancy Fraser, that ((ul))feminism ‘served to legitimate a structural transformation of capitalist society’((/ul)). I am with Nancy Fraser in so far as she says that there is a convergence, a coinciding of second wave feminism and neo-liberalism, even that feminism thrived in these conditions. It is well known that ((ul))in an attempt to renew and survive, capitalism co-opts the opposition to its own ends. If ((/ul))((ul))((hl))part of ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))the project of ((/ul))((ul))((hl))neoliberalism is to shrink the size of the state, ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))it serves its purpose((/ul))((ul))((hl)) to co-opt the feminist critique that the state is both paternalistic and patriarchal((/hl))((/ul)). Critiques of the nanny state from the right may chime with feminist concerns. However, the right has little to say about patriarchy. What is left out of the co-option process is equally significant. ((ul))The critique of the state mounted by feminists((/ul)) such as Elizabeth Wilson ((ul))when state capitalism((/ul)) ((ul))was at the height of its powers suited neoliberal capitalists seeking deregulation and a reduced role for the state.((/ul))¶ ((ul)) ((/ul)) Fraser’s analysis does not explain the current resurgence of feminism at a time when the shine of neoliberalism has faded. It is not so much that feminism legitimised neoliberalism, but that neoliberal values created a space for a bright, brassy and ultimately fake feminism - the ‘I really, really want’ girl-power ushered in by the Spice Girls. This transitional period between second wave and the current wave of feminism (which some commentators characterised as post-feminist) represented the archetypal appropriation of the feminist agenda, shorn of its political context, by neoliberalism. Incidentally, many of us rejected the label post-feminist because it felt like an attempt to chuck feminism into the dustbin of history and to deny the continuing need for it. In hindsight, there was something different going on in that lull between the two waves in the 70s and 80s and today; the voice of feminism was being drowned out by its loud, brassy sisters.¶ ((ul))If((/ul)) the culture of ((ul))neoliberalism had something to offer women, it was the idea of agency, of choice freely exercised((/ul)), free even of patriarchal restraints. ((ul))It emphasised self-sufficiency of the individual while at the same time undermining those collective struggles or institutions which make self-sufficiency possible((/ul)). The world was your oyster – all you needed to do was compete successfully in the marketplace. The flexible worker, in order to make herself acceptable to the world of work, may even go so far as to remodel herself through cosmetic surgery, all the while under the illusion that she was in control of her life. In her essay on ‘Feminism’ in a forthcoming book, Oxford Handbook of Political Ideologies, Clare Chambers argues that ((ul))((hl))liberal capitalism is committed to((/hl))((/ul)) what she calls ((ul))the ((/ul))((ul))((hl))‘fetishism of choice’((/hl))((/ul)). ((ul))If women choose things that disadvantage them and entrench differences, it legitimates inequality because the inequality arises from the choices they make((/ul)). ((ul))The few women who do well out of the sex industry do not believe that their work entrenches inequality because it is freely chosen, because prostitution is seen as a liberation from the drudgery of cleaning jobs((/ul)).

Like Spillers, ((ul))Agamben underlines the fact that biopolitics constructs the national population in a racially essentialist manner. But he cannot detect the specificity of racial formations((/ul)); ((ul))he cannot help us to understand the ways in which the anti-Semitism of the Nazis((/ul)) resembles, but also ((ul))deviates from, institutional racism in contemporary American society((/ul)). Further, ((ul))((hl))he completely fails to grasp the centrality of gender to the biopolitical project of producing bare life((/hl))((/ul)). For Agamben, the sovereign preserves for itself “the natural right to do anything to anyone.” 22 As the line between legitimate authority and the right of the sovereign in a state of exception to protect “the people” by producing bare life is increasingly blurred, we become unable to identify “any one clear figure of the sacred man.”23 In effect, “we are all virtually homines sacri.” 24 “Bare life is no longer confined to a particular place or a definite category. It now dwells in the biological body of every living being.”25 ((ul))The historical record, however, makes it crystal clear that it is the structurally disempowered who are most vulnerable to the exercise of arbitrary state power in the state of emergenc((/ul))y.

Thus, ((ul))the figure of ((/ul))((ul))((hl))bare life((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) that Agamben locates at the heart of sovereignty ((/ul))((ul))((hl))functions like a fetish object, allowing for((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) a perpetual ((/ul))((ul))((hl))oscillation between two contrary reactions to violence((/hl))((/ul))((ul)): a ((/ul))((ul))((hl))totalizing and fatalistic critique of sovereignty((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) on the one hand, ((/ul))((ul))((hl))and a fantasy of that relation without violence on the other((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). ((/ul))This brings us to the heart of the mystery concerning ((ul))((hl))the political status of Agamben's pronouncements((/hl))((/ul)) that introduced this paper. They ((ul))((hl))are not theories of((/hl))((/ul)) political ((ul))((hl))action but fantasies premised on a circumvention of the violence behind the relation of law and life((/hl))((/ul)). In this sense, ((ul))'whatever being' is not so much after sovereignty as it is in spite of it((/ul)). ((ul))Whatever being is a fantasy of a situation that is defined by the violence of law((/ul)). ((ul))The best way to understand Agamben's utopian pronouncements is therefore as a reaction to the violence of sovereignty, but not a theory to a way out of it.((/ul)) ((ul))Agamben's idea of a coming community brings us to the limit of the sovereignty but only at the level of subjective pleasure, not at the level of a politically consequential procedure((/ul)). The coming community is a correlate to the existing situation. Far from a future to come; it is a fantasy based on the here and now. In fact, one could argue that a form of life that plays with the law already exists in the state of exception. It is that of the sovereign. Freud was a clinician not a political theorist so when it comes to the authority of law his analytic discourse only raises the question of its form. It does not offer judgments on the use of the form. The point of this paper is that ((ul))((hl))while Agamben's diagnosis of the violence that underpins sovereignty may prepare us for thinking about political action((/hl))((/ul)), it is also the case that ((ul))((hl))when it comes to taking action his speculative utopianism \"leaves us standing at the door\"((/hl))((/ul)) in the end.56 This is the difficulty with some of ((ul))Agamben's pronouncements((/ul)); they ((ul))are not theories of political action but scenarios based on a subjective circumvention of the violence that sovereign law requires((/ul)).

This calls to mind a comment made by Jacques Lacan in The Other Side of Psychoanalysis in the context of a discussion of pleasure; he says \"((ul))we don't ever transgress. Sneaking around is not transgressing((/ul)).\"57 As we know from Kafka's parable, \"((ul))seeing a door half-open is not the same as going through it\".58 Although Agamben's critique of sovereignty takes us to the limit of this violence, the idea of whatever being does not go beyond it.((/ul))"],"stats":{"highlightedWords":114}},{"tag":"Agamben’s scholarship is incoherent – doesn’t provide a theory of political action necessary to overcome the sovereign power he identifies ","cite":"Passavant, Associate Professor of Political Science at Hobart and William Smith Colleges, PhD. in Political Science from University of Wisconsin, 2007","text":["(Paul A., “The Contradictory State of Giorgio Agamben,” Political Theory, Volume 35, Number 2, April 2007, https://www.jstor.org/stable/20452544, AH @ DDI)","In this essay, I examine ((ul))((hl))Agamben's((/hl))((/ul)) work as an example of this effort to rethink the ontological basis of politics.

This tendency is already visible; for ex- ample, it is possible for private companies to own and exploit human body substances (see Andrews/Nelkin 2001). Moreover, this ten- dency can already be traced in examples that Agamben mentions, namely the admissibility of euthanasia and transplantation medicine. Here we can expect that a patient’s legal will and contract relations will take the place of explicit state prohibitions and regulation. We note that in some countries there is already a public discussion to provide fi nancial com- pensations for individuals who donate organs, and there is a growing consensus in the legal community to accept the will of the patient not to prolong life under certain conditions. 8"],"stats":{"highlightedWords":116}},{"tag":"Agamben seriously misconstrues Foucault – the idea that dichotomies of zoe/bios hold across millennia misconceives power relations ","cite":"Blencowe, Associate Professor of Sociology at the University of Warwick, 2010","text":["(Claire, “Foucault’s and Arendt’s ‘insider view’ of biopolitics: a critique of Agamben,” History of the Human Sciences, Volume 23, Issue 5, September 27 2010, http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0952695110375762, accessed 7/22/18, AH @ DDI)","There is doubtless much insight in Agamben’s arguments about bare life and states of exception, arguments that have undergone considerable expansion in the decade intervening since Homo Sacer’s publication, and which shed greater insight upon the politics of the 21st century than the 19th (see Agamben, 2004, 2005).

These institutions and laws, it is argued, actually facilitate an infinite expansion of disciplinary coercion and ‘biopolitical’ control. Merely updating and expanding the classical discourse and reach of rights fails to grasp how power actually works in global politics.8 ((ul))((hl))Reform of existing institutions can only entrench rather than overcome the worst aspects of sovereign power and the system of nation-states that produces refugees((/hl))((/ul)). This article critically assesses Agamben’s claims regarding the significance of refugees for international political thought. ((ul))Given ‘the speed and range of the uptake of Agamben’s work’, how seriously should international theory take his construct of ‘the refugee’?((/ul)) Certainly, the empirical evidence in support of studies into the disciplining and biopolitical management of refugees is compelling.10 The ‘corporeal turn’ in political and social thought – analysis of the distinction and blurring of the distinction between our biological and political lives – should be taken seriously. This subject of analysis is routine in the humanities and other social sciences but it has only belatedly received attention from scholars in IR.11 In relation to refugees, ((ul))Agamben’s work joins others in making it harder to accept liberal and conventional realist theory on their own terms; they do not provide sufficient analytical and normative understanding of the real and symbolic violence administered to refugees, including by liberal democracies((/ul)).12 With forced migration reaching record figures it no longer makes sense, if it ever did, to represent political subjectivity in terms of state/nation/territory. There are strong normative and analytical grounds for placing refugees and the study of forced migration at the centre of the study of world politics. ((ul))((hl))Nonetheless((/hl))((/ul)), it will be argued here that ((ul))((hl))Agamben’s ‘figure of the refugee’ falls short((/hl))((/ul)). ((ul))((hl))This construction takes the reduction of refugees to the level of ‘bare life’ too far((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) As suggested below, while much of the literature on so-called ‘biopolitics’ is illuminating and productive, we need not accept all aspects of Agamben’s view of what happens when ‘life’ is placed at the centre of politics. The first part of this article sets out in more detail Agamben’s claims regarding sovereignty and the political significance of ‘naked’ or ‘bare life’ for the condition of refugees. The second section suggests, contra Agamben, that ((ul))while the breakdown of the distinction between human and citizen is at the heart of the problem faced by refugees((/ul)) (and potentially all bearers of human rights), ((ul))((hl))the ‘abstract nakedness’ of human beings is((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))– or should be ((ul))((hl))seen as – politically irrelevant((/hl))((/ul)).13 The argument is made by turning to Hannah ((ul))Arendt((/ul)) who has been enormously influential for both the history of thought on refugees and Agamben’s political theory.14 Her writing ((ul))suggests that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))if refugee populations are not to face some inexorable trend toward a rule of ‘exception’((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), then it will not be through reclaiming ‘bare life’. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))It will be wholly dependent on the ability to forge a public realm grounded on the appropriate distinction between nature and political artifice((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), between human life and the political world((/ul)). ((ul))What is at stake in ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the difference between Agamben and Arendt is illustrated through the example of((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) refugee ((/ul))((ul))((hl))lip-sewing((/hl))((/ul)).

I will now examine ((ul))((hl))the contentious issue of detaining people with severe mental distress in psychiatric hospitals and show how this can lead to a state of exception((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) The term ‘severe mental distress’ is being used her e in preference to ‘severe mental health problems’ in line with the development of a social model of madness and distress which directly challenges individual model s of mental health (Beresford, 2002). Currently there are plans to strengthen the mental health law in the UK which would allow people with untreatable mental health conditions, such as severe personality disorders to be detained even if they have not committed a crime (BBC News, 2006). Under the current law, someone with a psychopathic disorder can only be forcibly detained, for the protection of themselves or others, if their condition is treatable. In addition the amendments include extending the use of compulsory treatment outside hospital to patients living in the community which could include the setting of curfews on these patients, or what have been termed ‘psychiatric Asbos’ (Batty, 2006). This bill is being opposed by backbench MPs and campaigners because it gives the authorities the power to restrict people’s civil liberties and ironically is likely to deter some vulnerable and potentially dangerous people from seeking treatment in the first place. A press release from the British Medical Association Medical Ethics Committee stated that: ‘It is essential that anyone with a mental health disorder can only be compulsorily treated if there is some clear health benefit linked to this action. Mental health legislation cannot be used to detain people whom the authorities simply want locked away. If people are deemed a danger to others then criminal proceedings need to be implemented, if appropriate.’ (Calland, 2006) ((ul))Thus ((/ul))((ul))((hl))someone with severe mental distress could lose the protection typically afforded to people by criminal law((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) (innocent until proven guilty) and instead find themselves entangled within mental health law which legitimately restricts their human and civil rights. ‘By law, mental health service users’ rights can be removed in the name of ‘treatment’. They can be subjected forcibly to ‘treatments’ which are evidenced to have damaging, sometimes fatal, effect s – treatments which include Donna Reeve 209 neurosurgery, electro-convulsive treatment (ECT) an d the use of outdated and risky psychotropic/neuroleptic drugs.’((/ul)) (Beresford , et al. , 2002:389-390) Therefore once someone has been detained under the Mental Health Act they can be subject to treatment; whilst there will be cases where this is highly appropriate and/or desirable for the person in question, others will experience treatment which in other circumstances would be seen as a form of assault. ((ul))It is at this point that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))a state of exception exists because these people find themselves in hospital, with greatly reduced human and civil rights and being forcibly ‘ treated’.((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) What would normally be considered abusive is allowed within this setting a nd ((/ul))((ul))((hl))patients can become homo sacer, subject to the ‘sovereign’ power of the doct ors, social workers and other professionals who control their daily life, treatment and release date.((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) Additionally, the very nature of the reason for their incarceration means that any attempts at protestation or resistance are likely to be seen as further proof of their need for treatment.((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))"],"stats":{"highlightedWords":91}},{"tag":"Increasing women’s representation in the government can fix its historical patriarchal purpose – we should not rule out the benefits of assimilation","cite":"Alter 15 (Charlotte, national correspondent at TIME Magazine.

So it shouldn’t be any surprise that ((ul))Sweden is((/ul)) regularly held up as an example of ((ul))a paradise for working women((/ul)).

ADVERTISING inRead invented by Teads Rwanda In Rwanda, the Parliament is almost 64% female, according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union, and for tragic reasons. After the country was ripped apart by genocide in 1994, Rwanda found itself with a population that was 70% female, since thousands of men were killed in bloodshed between the Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups (of the 780 judges in the country before the massacre, only 20 survived). Before the genocide, women held only 10% to 15% of Parliament seats, according to the Harvard Kennedy School, but the massacre of so many men created a power vacuum that Rwandan women quickly filled. However unhappily it came about, ((ul))((hl))the new female legislations helped pass laws allowing women to own land and open bank accounts((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) A quota introduced in 2003 mandated that 30% of all government roles be reserved for women, and only women can vote for these women-only seats. Fittingly, it’s women who have felt the benefits.

Finland Finland has always been ahead of other countries in female representation — it was one of the first countries in the world where women had the unrestricted right to vote and run for Parliament. And while it’s hard to separate Finland’s extremely progressive policies from the fact that the government has always had more female representation than most, those policies also can’t necessarily be directly attributed to the influence of Finnish women in government. So take these two facts as you will: ((ul))the ministry in Finland is 62% female, and they’ve managed to create a public education system that could be the new gold standard((/ul)). Finnish students far outperformed students from the U.S., the U.K. and Russia in all academic areas, and they’ve consistently hovered near the top of academic excellence, according to PISA, the international standardized test. Yet Finnish schools rarely have standardized tests, emphasize play over homework, pay their teachers well, and everyone goes to “Governments are meant to represent the people who elect them public schools. The country, ranked by some as the best place to live in the world, now has stellar education, generous paid maternity leave and heavily subsidized child care hardwired into society.

((ul))The kind of choices that “choice feminism” has given women has also been trivialized((/ul)), along the lines of what to have for lunch and what brand of cosmetics to use. Reading all ((ul))this has made me really concerned((/ul)), because ((ul))it is unfair, ahistorical, and ((/ul))indeed, ((ul))dangerous.((/ul)) “Choice feminism,” or ((ul))((hl))liberal feminism((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))as it should properly be called, ((ul))((hl))is all about striving for any woman to have the same rights, same opportunities and same respect as any man((/hl))((/ul)). Historically, ((ul))((hl))it has also been the most successful branch of feminism((/hl))((/ul)). ((ul))Liberal feminism was((/ul)) largely ((ul))responsible for many gains of the last century, including voting rights, education rights and more equal pay at work.((/ul)) This success was due to several reasons. Firstly, ((ul))liberal feminism is((/ul)) simply ((ul))a logical extension to liberal values((/ul)). Liberal feminism was able to gain broad-based support, because ((ul))its goals were just logical to anyone who((/ul)) already ((ul))believed in liberty and equality((/ul)). Many early feminists were both liberals and liberal feminists, and many liberal men of that era, John Stuart Mill perhaps the most famous of them, were also keen supporters of women’s rights. Secondly, ((ul))liberal feminism has always maintained a tight focus, squarely on the matter of gender equality((/ul)). As ((ul))various branches of radical feminism((/ul)) are strongly associated with socialism, Marxism, atheism and so on, they ((ul))often expand excessive energy and political capital in fighting for these other causes((/ul)). Even recently, some feminists have noted that ((ul))(radical) feminism is spreading itself too thin((/ul)), noting that the environmentalist movement or the marriage equality movement, for example, have a much tighter focus. ((ul))If not for the strong focus of liberal feminists, women’s rights would probably have gone nowhere in the past century. ((/ul))There’s also nothing wrong with giving women choices. ((ul))The condition of women's lives a century ago was heavily characterized by a lack of choice((/ul)). Women had no choice economically, politically, or socially. Therefore, ((ul))they were powerless in almost all aspects of their lives. Liberal feminism has given women: political((/ul)) choice (via the right to vote and stand for office), ((ul))economic((/ul)) choice (via the opportunity to work and the right to equal pay), and ((ul))social choice((/ul)) (via dismantling the social pressure that women must live a certain way) … … ((ul))and the world is better for it((/ul)). Women’s political choices have shaped political outcomes heavily. For example, most U.S. Democratic victories in the past century wouldn’t have been if not for women’s suffrage. ((ul))Women’s economic choices have meant that men cannot just take them for granted or treat them like slaves anymore. Only those lacking in historical vision would trivialize “choice feminism.” ((/ul))Liberal feminism is still fulfilling important functions today. Liberal feminism remains very serious about the idea of making sure that any woman has the same political, economic and social choices as any man. As a result, liberal feminists respect that any woman can equally be as left-wing, right-wing or anywhere in between as any man, because anything else is unacceptable. This stands in contrast to many forms of radical feminism, where women can be made to feel unwelcome if they don’t “toe the party line((ul)).” Liberal feminism is also uniquely suited to deal with intersectional issues, due to its inherent respect of individual choice((/ul)). ((ul))((hl))Liberal feminism has absolutely no problems with the fact that ethnic or queer women may have a different perspective on life and hence different priorities and choices, and will never pressure these women to fall into line with the views and choices of mainstream straight, white feminism((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) The fact that ((ul))liberal feminism has never had the severe transphobia that to some extent still plagues radical feminism is a good example. ((/ul))“Choice feminism,” or ((ul))liberal feminism as it should be known as, is no trivial thing((/ul)). Striving for women to have the same choices as men is at the very heart of feminism, and without this ideal there would not have been any feminism at all.

Similarly, no nation can reach to high success and glory until women are not provided opportunities to work side by side with men (Maccionis, 2009). Equal involvement of women in various fields is important for the socioeconomic development of their country. In spite of their social and economic role in family and economy; they encounter multiple problems in various spheres of their lives. A number of reasons are connected with the male social status in the society and the most dominant one is their physique which makes them suitable for various socio-economic activities (Rustagi, 2000). It is a fact that ((ul))women from the very start have been facing((/ul)) a lot of ((ul))problems in various spheres of life especially in political((/ul)) one.

((ul))Women confront various problems and challenges in the way of their political participation((/ul)). Women involvement and participation in politics is of recent emergence dates back to late eighteen century. Women were given the right to vote for the first time in New Zealand in 1883. Finland offered the right of vote to women in 1906; Norway gave them the right in 1913 while Germany bestowed women with the right of vote in 1918.

((ul))The participation of women in political activities began to increase((/ul)) recently but is still considerably lower (Maloutas 1998). Further in global perspective as far as women political empowerment is concerned, they hold just 15.2 percent of seats in parliaments across the world. Women political empowerment varies from society to society. Similarly((ul)), in the United States little change has occurred in politics((/ul)). In 2002 national elections, only six of the fifty state governors were women which, was very low ratio. In South Asia the women political empowerment is also not satisfactory. In Ukraine various measures have been taken to bring gender equality in public sphere especially in political domain but still there is low level of political participation of Ukrainian women (Fund, 2011). Similarly, ((ul))in Kenya, women participation is very low((/ul)) and there is not enough representation of women in political activities. Many reasons such as ((ul))variations in norms, value system and rigid culture are impeding women participation in political activities((/ul)) but the only and common factors which lower their participation is gender discrimination. Low participation of women in politics is because of their low level of literacy (Davis, 2008). Further women traditionally are considered inferior to male which leads to lack of women political empowerment in the South Asia. Women political representation around the globe is very low and received only 33 percent seats for women in the parliament (UNDP report, 2005). No doubt the reservation of 33% seats is a change in the political history of Pakistan. It is of course one of the positive changes that encouraged women especially in the urban areas. Further the situation is worst in rural areas especially in the traditional and conservative districts of Pakistan. As it is a fact that gender role is not ascribed instead it is greatly in relation with the culture. In Pakistan women are dealt in every domain of life discriminately and even it will not be wrong to say that woman is considered less important for the public sphere especially in politics. ((ul))They have very low participation in politics in Pakistan ((/ul))especially in rural areas. Political participation of women is one of the core factors in the development of any nation and also a core determinant of women empowerment. But unfortunately sociocultural factors like ((ul))norms and values, patriarchy and misinterpretation of religion prevent women from participating in political activities especially in rural areas.((/ul)) In Pakistan especially in the traditional districts of rural areas, socio-cultural, and economic factors come in the way of women political participation (Shaheed et.al 2009). The Women, Research Journal, Volume 10, 2018 29 Further in economic factors women poverty, unemployment and inflation prohibit and discourage women political participation. In economic domain, women are dependent upon male and their economic instability do not allow them to participate in political activities (Aderinwale, 1997).

This has been said many times, but I’ll say it again: ((ul))Mainstream feminists must listen to women of Color when they voice their struggles. ((/ul))I don’t believe feminisms is a monolithic movement, so I understand why some feminist groups and organizations focus their work on the issues that affect their immediate communities. But hear me out, and you’ll understand why immigration reform must be seen as a feminist issue foremost. Gender Bias in the Immigration System ((ul))((hl))Our immigration system is steeped in gender biases that disproportionately affect women and children((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). ((/ul))A staggering three-quarters of all immigrants in the US are women and children, and most of these women are marginalized by our immigration system and laws. 70% of all immigrant women arrive with a family visa. This visa program allows legal immigrants to request their family members in their home countries in the hopes of reuniting the family. Other ways in which immigrants arrive in the United States is via employment visas, which are awarded to individuals in highly sought after professions in STEM, or to individuals that are exceptionally skilled in the arts. However, ((ul))((hl))our immigration system is heavily influenced by gender roles that assume men are the heads of households, while women and children are dependents((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) These biases affect the application process((ul)), allowing men’s applications to be seen as the most favorable. ((/ul))This is most often seen in applications for family visas, where male relatives often become the petitioners for their female relatives, a process that can take up to twenty years in some cases. While relatives await visa approval, they must remain in their home countries often without much needed economic support, and must renew their application every year it isn’t approved, which can become a financial burden. To make matters direr, they cannot be employed while awaiting visa approval because that could be seen as a sign of independence and her need for a visa petitioner could be questioned. Similarly, women are marginalized by employee-based immigration requirements. Careers in male-dominated fields, specially STEM, are seen as most favorable, which wouldn’t be a problem if women weren’t grossly under-represented in these careers. As an engineer, I see this gender gap every day. In the United States, women comprise 24% of STEM professionals, while Latinas make up only 3% of STEM professionals. The gender gap in these professions is even wider in Latin America and other countries where immigrants arrive from. Yet 140,000 visas a year are available for these mostly male professionals. ((ul))Because these visas are awarded to mostly men, their spouses are turned into dependents by our immigration system that allows visa holders’ families to come with them, but does not give them the legal right to work in the United States. ((/ul))These women might have been professionals in their home countries, but ((ul))due to our immigration systems’ biases, they can only be dependents in the United States. ((/ul))At the other end of this spectrum are migrant and domestic workers, with only 10,000 visas a year available for them. Employment visas for these so-called “low skill” professionals are an uphill battle, and immigrants are often reluctant to even apply for work visas with these credentials. Although immigrants with agricultural and domestic skills are in high demand, our immigration system does not value their work to provide them with a legal pathway to the United States. It’s no surprise that of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States, many are migrant workers in agriculture, oftentimes working under inhumane conditions and for little pay and no benefits. The public dislike for undocumented immigrants is distressing, but what we don’t realize is that we rely on their work to make our lives comfortable. Domestic Work: Low Wages and No Legal Protections ((ul))Domestic workers are often mistreated because their work is considered “women’s work” and therefore undervalued. ((/ul))Child rearing, cleaning, washing, and cooking are not activities people often associate with careers and jobs, and that means that the people who do this work as equally undervalued. And ((ul))while working conditions for most domestic workers is not ideal, the treatment they receive and the wages they get paid are often dependent on their race and immigration status. ((/ul))According to this study on domestic workers, 46% of domestic workers are foreign born and 35% are non-citizens. ((ul))Mainstream feminism has acknowledged that domestic worker protections are a feminist issue, but we fail to see the connection to immigration reform. Immigrant women are mostly poor and hold jobs as domestic workers, yet these jobs offer the least amount of benefits. ((/ul))They are generally underpaid, with 70% of them making less than $13 an hour. The women are also overworked and are not entitled to health benefits, paid time off, or sick days. Unsurprisingly, 85% of undocumented immigrants who are domestic workers do not complain about their working conditions and low wages for fear that their immigration status would be used against them. The fear of mistreatment and deportation is always looming for undocumented women, which is exacerbated when they have families of their own to support. ((ul))Our legal system does little to help them((/ul)), as domestic workers are often employed in private homes and are excluded from coverage under federal employment and labor laws. Similarly, they are excluded from protections by the Occupational Safety and Health Act, because the act does not cover employers who do household work. We depend on domestic workers to rise up the career ladder, to take care of our children, and to clean our homes. These women are integral to our professional and personal development, and we owe it to them to care about their lives and that of their families. Domestic and Gender-Based Violence ((ul))Women are disproportionately affected by the delay in immigration reform. ((/ul))((ul))While 1 in 4 women in the United States experience domestic violence, immigrant women are 3 to 6 times more likely to experience domestic violence. ((/ul))Services for victims of domestic violence are not dependent on immigration status, so providing protection to these women will not result in legal repercussions. Domestic violence organizations and shelters are trained in helping immigrant women navigate the system and find the protection they need In truth, ((ul))allies and organizations need not to be experts in immigration in order to provide support for undocumented women((/ul)). As advocates ((ul))our role is simply to inform undocumented women and their families and ensure they receive the assistance they need. ((/ul))It is especially important to know that undocumented women suffer from a complex intersection of immigration status, violence, sexism, and racism. Their ((ul))((hl))abusers manipulate their lives by using their precarious immigration status as a threat((/hl))((/ul)). For this reason, ((ul))we fought hard to make sure VAWA had provisions for immigrant women, and the work paid off as visas are awarded to victims of domestic violence, and for victims of persecution, yet ((/ul))((ul))the battle is only half won. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Not only are immigrant women more likely to face domestic violence than American women, they are also less likely to report it for fear of deportation((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).((/hl)) During the NOW-NYC panel I attended, Tiloma Jayasinghe, the executive director of Sakhi for South Asian Women, spoke about VAWA and its failures. As mainstream feminists fought to ensure VAWA was reenacted, immigrant women were rarely invited to attend meetings and discussions. The results are that we now only have a law-and-order approach to domestic violence, which isn’t always the best tool when dealing with immigrant women, and especially undocumented immigrants. If the only recourse for undocumented victims of domestic violence is to call the police and file a report, they expose their legal status to a figure of authority. While women in such situations are protected from deportation, it is a precarious position to be in. VAWA protocol also calls for mandatory arrests, but this may discourage women from calling the police for fear that their partners could be deported or sent to jail. As many of them rely on their spouses for the family’s financial support, they fear losing their source of income and livelihood. Deportation ((ul))Deportations have increased, and children suffer the most when parents are deported. ((/ul))In 2012, the Obama administration deported 409,849 undocumented immigrants, the highest number of deportations on record so far. Overall, 1.5 million undocumented immigrants were deported in President Obama’s first term. And ((ul))while deportations break families apart, it is hardest on children, especially those born in the United States who regularly stay behind when their parents or guardians are deported. ((/ul))The number of children left without guardians has tripled in the last five years, from 8,041 in 2008 to 24,481 children in 2012, and these numbers may represent only a fraction of the total number. Most of these children are moving from foster homes, to shelters, and eventually to relatives living in the United States, but their fate depends on a crucial part of immigration reform – the Dream Act, which has failed to pass. Families not only live in fear for their lives, but that of their children. And who can blame them for having these fears when the threat of their children are left to fend for themselves and become “unoccupied minors” looms. Brianda is a twenty-three year old young woman whose mother was deported nine years ago to Mexico. Her father passed away thirteen years ago, forcing her mother to cross the border in hopes of forming a better future for her children. As the eldest child responsibility for her younger siblings fell on her hands, so that for the last nine years she had to be her siblings’ sister and mother. “Family comes first, so that’s the way I was raised that before anything else you have to take care of your family… Now that my parents are gone I have to take care of my family because that’s the only thing I have left,” she says. *** ((ul))Feminism is about addressing beliefs, ((/ul))((ul))policies, and laws((/ul))((ul)) that disproportionately affect women and their families. Immigration reform has been tabled ((/ul))until next year((ul)) ((/ul))as other issues, like Syria and the debt ceiling, have taken precedence. ((ul))This leaves millions of undocumented families in limbo as they wonder what will happen to them. ((/ul))Pro-reform Republican representative Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida said that there are “very few days available on the floor in the House, so I don’t think we’re going to be able to do it this year.” And if the House won’t act any immigration reform early next year before the elections, it is unlikely any reform will be possible until 2015. This isn’t a partisan issue anymore. Activists continue to fight so that our government stops delaying the issue and blaming the calendar for their lack of time. Ironically, in 2005 after only two days of deliberation, the House passed an immigration bill that would have rendered 11 million undocumented people felons. ((ul))Yet every immigration bill that can potentially help most of the undocumented people living in the United States is turned down because parties cannot agree on all measures. ((/ul))And although not one comprehensive bill has been approved, ((ul))reports show that in 2012, 865 immigration bills were introduced in 43 states((/ul)), down from 1,538 bills in all states that were introduced in 2011. ((ul))These bills range from education and health, to law enforcement and voting.((/ul)) But ((ul))piecemeal bills aren’t going to fix the problem((/ul)), a problem ((ul))that overwhelmingly affects women and children((/ul)), who make up three-quarters of all immigrants. ((ul))Immigration reform cannot be held up any longer, not while children of deported undocumented immigrants are left to fend for themselves and become “unoccupied minors,” and domestic workers continue to be cheated out of a living wage and humane working conditions, and women’s work continue to be undervalued. Immigration reform is a human’s rights issue, and it needs to happen now((/ul))."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":76}},{"tag":"Women must engage in the fight for immigration reform – new developments in politics have provided a unique opportunity to re-center the experiences of women in immigration through pragmatism – debates and discussions are key","cite":"Jayapal 13 (Pramila, Congresswoman representing Washington’s 7th District, came to the United States by herself at the age of 16 to attend college at Georgetown University and later received her MBA from Northwestern University, “Immigration Reform: Good for Immigrant Women, Good for American Feminism”, The Nation, 4/9/13, https://www.thenation.com/article/immigration-reform-good-immigrant-women-good-american-feminism/)KJR","text":["\"Ain't I a woman?\" As woman after woman stepped to the microphone at the Hyatt Regency ballroom in Washington, D.C., and made the case for why immigration is a women’s issue, Sojourner Truth’s words rang in my ears.

Immigration policy((/ul)) really ((ul))is about women. Two-thirds of immigrants to America are women and children((/ul)). Current ((ul))immigration policy and past reform proposals are((/ul)) what I have called “((ul))sexclusionary” in many ways: women’s work has not been recognized as real work((/ul)), ((ul))only 27% of employment visas go to women, protections for survivors of gender-based violence are being eroded, and Congress is threatening to limit the very family sponsorship system that has allowed so many women to come to America. ((/ul))ADVERTISING Previous ((ul))and current debates have largely left out any analysis of immigration as a women’s issue.((/ul)) Partly because of that, ((ul))previous immigration reform proposals((/ul)) were structured in ways that ((ul))would have left out millions of women from any path to legalization((/ul)), and would have weakened parts of the immigration system that women depend on. For example, if legalization and a path to citizenship are tied to showing proof of employment (as has been the case in the past), millions of undocumented women would be excluded who work as domestic workers, in informal industries, or at home taking care of their own children. Similarly, ((ul))the current push by Republican Senators to eliminate certain family immigration categories((/ul))—such as adult children or siblings—and weaken the overall family immigration system ((ul))would disproportionately affect women((/ul)), 70% of whom come to the U.S. through family sponsorship. Last month, ((ul))many of these issues were front and center during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on women and immigration((/ul)). ((ul))This was ((/ul))((ul))the first time((/ul))((ul)) in((/ul)) all the ((ul))immigration policy debates for women to be the center of a hearing on the Hill. ((/ul))Senator Mazie Hirono, who chaired the hearing and is currently the only immigrant Senator, spoke movingly about her own experience of immigrating to America with a mother who was escaping domestic violence. Republicans, loath to appear anti-woman, put forward two witnesses who largely made the case with Democratic witnesses for the disproportionate burden that women face from a broken immigration system. All five witnesses emphasized not only the challenges immigrant women face but also the contributions—from engineers to domestic workers to mothers. Recent polling indicates that ((ul))there is enormous potential to engage women voters on immigration.((/ul)) In a national dial survey with 800 women across the country conducted by Lake Research Partners for the We Belong Together campaign, women responded best to messages that connected the need for immigration reform to three things: America’s commitment to providing freedom and opportunity to women and girls; the shared experience of moving to put food on the table and do what is necessary for family; and the belief that it is what you contribute—not what you look like or where you come from—that defines you as American. By the end of the fifteen-minute survey, ((ul))a stunning 30 percent of women who started out with mixed views of immigrants shifted to view immigrants positively.((/ul)) ((hl))And ((/hl))((ul))((hl))using a woman’s voice to deliver the messages was more persuasive((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) than when a similar message was tested with a man’s voice. The opportunity ((/hl))((/ul))clearly ((ul))((hl))exists to move women((/hl))((/ul))((hl))—((/hl))((ul))((hl))U.S. born and immigrant((/hl))((/ul))—who have not been vocal on immigration before ((ul))to start to speak up((/ul)), and to advocate ((ul))loudly so that immigrant women do not get left out of any immigration legislation.((/ul)) There are three important reasons why ((ul))((hl))women’s groups across the country should make a clear feminist argument for why immigration is a women’s issue((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). ((/ul))First((ul)), women voters need to speak up((/ul)) to make sure that immigration policy does not continue to ((ul))exclude((/ul)) documented and undocumented ((ul))immigrant women((/ul)). A “Gang of Eight” all-male Senators is close to completing a bi-partisan proposal to fix our outdated immigration system. ((ul))Congress needs to hear the voices and priorities of women across the country((/ul)) and remember that women—along with immigrants—cast determinative votes in last year’s election. Second, if there is one thing that resonates for women, it is that regardless of where we come from or what we look like, we want to be fully recognized for the breadth of our contributions. For immigrant women, the very act of immigration is about opportunity, equality and freedom. Women immigrants come to America to care for their families, escape gender-based violence, or express their sexual identity. The women’s movement has always fought for these kinds of core values and principles—from ending slavery to the right to vote and the ability to work—and needs to lead again on immigration. Finally, ((ul))we need a stronger and broader women’s movement ((/ul))((ul))((hl))if we are going to make strides forward instead of falling back((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) We need strength to fight the challenges to our reproductive rights and the defunding of Planned Parenthood. Women still only earn 77 cents on the dollar compared to men. ((ul))We need to grow our movement and bring in fresh, new voices((/ul)). We need brown, black and white women to be loud and proud. ((ul))((hl))We need to ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))expand the idea of choice((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) to be about all the choices we make in our lives: including which country we choose to live in((/ul)) so we can be whole and full women. ((ul))For immigrant women((/ul)), fighting for some of the standard platforms of the women’s movement may feel unthinkable when deportation is staring you in the face every day. ((ul))Immigration reform will free their voices to speak fully again. The struggle for immigration reform allows the women’s movement to build relationships. We need to start building that movement of the future right now, when it counts most for immigrant women((/ul)). So, as the debate continues, let’s raise immigration reform as a women’s issue. It’s time to say loudly, “Ain’t we all women too?” ((ul))It’s time to stand shoulder to shoulder as women to demand our full place at the table and an immigration system that works for us.

Most of my work focused on the Immigration Project and all of the myriad ways that homophobia and transphobia can combine to make queer and trans* immigrants bear the brunt of the U.S.’s already racist and xenophobic immigration laws. My experiences at NCLR made clear to me that ((ul))((hl))fighting for the human rights of queer and trans* people must involve coalition building with immigrant rights’ groups ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))to pass comprehensive immigration reform((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). ((/ul))Thankfully, Mitt Romney’s defeat seems to have spurred even the Republican leadership to take seriously the need for dramatically changing the immigration law regime. ((ul))Queer and trans* immigrants must be included in these reforms. ((/ul))The most well-known example of immigration law that affects queer and trans* immigrants is the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which only recognizes marriages (in the case for immigration purposes) between “one man and one woman.” As a result, cisgender same-gender couples cannot sponsor one another for marriage-based immigration. Domestic partnerships and civil unions are also not recognized. Perversely, the ban also excludes the spouses of queer refugees who have been resettled to the U.S. as a direct result of fleeing persecution based on sexual orientation. If a queer person marries their same-gender U.S. citizen partner and they have a temporary work or student visa that requires intent to return to their home country, then they run the risk of having their visa revoked. DOMA also impacts trans* people in different-gender marriages because federal law does not define the terms “man” or “woman.” As a result, legal sex for marriage-based immigration purposes is determined in ways complex and confusing enough that I’m publishing a 50+ page law review article on the subject. Moreover, ((ul))the general harshness of immigration laws harms queer and trans* people in heightened ways((/ul)). For instance, while U.S. asylum law protects people fleeing sexual orientation and/or gender identity-based persecution, immigrants must currently apply for asylum within one year of entering the country in order to be eligible. ((ul))Many very low-income undocumented queer and trans* refugees((/ul)), who often have limited education, English proficiency, and understanding of U.S. law((ul)), have no idea that they are eligible for asylum and often do not learn that until after the one year mark has passed.((/ul)) Many queer and trans* immigrants have past experiences of violence from authority figures in their home countries. Unfortunately, poor queer and trans* immigrants of color, especially trans women of color, frequently encounter violence and profiling from U.S. police as well. ((ul))As a result of these experiences, many queer and trans* immigrants have justified fears of outing themselves to U.S. government authorities. ((/ul))The one year window for applying for asylum may be overcome in some very limited circumstances (for example, if an asylum-seeker only recently came out, was diagnosed with HIV, or suffered from severe depression.) Additionally, if a person applies for asylum and is rejected (because their excuse for missing the one year deadline was not accepted or because the interviewer doesn’t believe that they seem queer enough or that the harm they’d risk if they were deported is severe enough), they will be automatically placed in deportation proceedings. Asylum seekers with otherwise strong cases can be rejected for minor criminal offenses, which disproportionately affects low-income queer and trans* undocumented people with arrest records for drugs or sex work attributable to over-policing, profiling, extreme employment discrimination, social marginalization, and untreated PTSD. ((ul))Thus, coming forward to apply for asylum is often extremely risky even for those who rightly fear persecution if they return to their home countries. Being deported once renders immigrants ineligible for future asylum, even if they experienced persecution upon return to their home countries. ((/ul))One of my clients is a trans woman who, when deported to Mexico, was stabbed in the street by a stranger yelling “fag” within two hours of her arrival. My client’s deportation, which almost killed her, disqualifies her from seeking asylum. Strict criminal record restrictions disproportionately impact queer and trans* people of color in routine immigration procedures. Applying for citizenship or for a replacement green card can result in being placed in deportation proceedings if a person has an arrest history. Another client was a middle-aged trans woman adopted as a young child from overseas by American citizens and kicked out of the house by her adoptive parents after she came out as a teenager. Forced to support herself through sex work, because in the 1970s (not unlike today) few other options existed for homeless trans* youth of color. In doing so, she racked up a series of arrests. Until fairly recently, adopted children did not automatically gain citizenship, and she now fears being deported to a country she doesn’t remember if she dares to apply for citizenship or a replacement for her expired green card. ((ul))Queer and trans* people in U.S. immigration detention centers experience horrific rates of sexual assault in detention((/ul)), including from guards. ((ul))Trans women risk sexual, physical, and psychological abuse((/ul)), whether housed with the general male population or placed in solitary confinement for twenty-three hours a day, sometimes for years, “for their own protection.” ((ul))HIV-positive immigrants((/ul)) (many of whom are queer or trans*) ((ul))are often not given retroviral medications. Trans* people are frequently denied hormones and gender-specific clothing items such as bras and binders. ((/ul))Immigration officials cruelly denied my client (the one who was stabbed after being deported) razors to shave her face during her detention, despite the fact that she had been presenting as female since she was a young child. ((ul))Suffering from untreated PTSD and ongoing abuses, many trans* immigrants with strong asylum claims give up and accept deportation((/ul)) because they can no longer handle unbearable detention conditions. Queer and trans* DREAMers who were brought to the U.S. as children are impacted by all of the above-mentioned factors. Marriage-based immigration as a means of gaining status is often not an option. Applying for asylum is usually unacceptably risky, since by definition DREAMers have missed the one year bar and almost always lack the personal experiences of past persecution in their birth countries that are often part of a strong asylum case since they arrived in the U.S. as young children. Additionally, even Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy has very strict criminal records requirements. Deferred action also has education requirements, and many low-income undocumented queer and trans* youth experience bullying and harassment in schools or the school-to-prison pipeline, leading them to leave school. ((ul))Current U.S. immigration laws are broken and unjust((/ul)).

((ul))Most of what appears in the Chinese media relies on tropes demolished above, ((/ul))and scholarship on the mainland is not particularly sophisticated. ((ul))Many specialists in Chinese security studies appear to be obsessed with strategic culture and unearthing the Chinese way of war.((/ul)) This is an attempt to find both greatness and solace in history. Although a Chinese way of war existed in the past, ((ul))tradition has been under intense attack for most of the last century, and the world view of Chinese leaders has been so conditioned by foreign ideologies and military doctrines that it is hard to find much continuity with that past. ((/ul))Aspects of contemporary Chinese strategy resonate with the past but may be coincidental. ((ul))((hl))A deeper understanding of how statecraft has been practiced in peace and war is needed, but in the near term one should not be surprised by the continuation of self-Orientalizing reductionism that has characterized the debate. Understanding Chinese military experience calls for examination of the counterpoints to the myths that matter, including territory, size, strategy, culture, and the near seas.((/hl))((/ul))((hl)) ((/hl))((ul))((hl))China has waged countless wars of territorial expansion and defense((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).((/hl)) Because controlling continental and maritime arenas is intimately linked to political legitimacy((ul)), China has tended to overemphasize the value of territorial objectives((/ul)). The large Chinese population, relative economic prosperity, and sophisticated bureaucracy led to gigantism in military affairs. From vast continent-spanning fortifications and treasure fleets to the herculean efforts of the Korean War, even ((ul))recent Chinese governments have translated immense military potential into immense military capability. ((/ul))While quantity may have a quality of its own, the gigantism of the past and present China has produced important works of strategy, among them The Art of War and writings of Mao Zedong. Perhaps it is because of the scale of warfare that thinking about the linkage between military operations and their political consequences has enjoyed a rich tradition in China. Historically, China has been a continental power, but it has been putting to sea since at least the tenth century. ((ul))Proximity to the ocean and the first island chain is vital to Chinese security and prosperity. ((/ul))For most of its long history China has dealt with a region marked by both uncertainty and overlapping sovereignties. That worked to the advantage of Chinese states, because as long as a hostile power did not control the near seas, they enjoyed the fruits of maritime trade without the need for a large navy. ((ul))Today Chinese views are conditioned by a century of humiliation. If given the requisite military capability and provocation, the Chinese will go to war at sea. ((/ul))As opposed to a single coherent strategic culture, myths represent flawed assumptions that many Chinese and foreign observers enthusiastically embrace. Myths not only seek to define a Chinese way of war but posit alterities that define the strategic culture of a potential enemy. The yin-yang of the philosophy ofDaosim and the dialectics of Marxism-Leninism may explain contemporary Chinese strategists who regard the inclinations of adversaries as the polar opposite of their strategic culture myths. China is not alone in embracing this version of strategic polarity, but given the insecurities that plague its growing military potential, it is nonetheless troubling to find questions of policy, strategy, and war dealt with in simplistic ways."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":78}},{"tag":"Desecuritizing language alone fails – it’s part of a wider process","cite":"Snetkov 17 – Aglaya Snetkov is a senior researcher at the ETH Zurich and an adjunct lecturer at the Universities of Zurich and St Gallen.

The Copenhagen School model outlines that ((ul))for an issue to be repositioned from the status of non-politicized or politicized to that of securitized requires an authorized and responsible actor to name it as an existential security threat to a particular referent object, and for this ‘securitizing move’ to be accepted by the relevant audience of this referent object, the endorsing of extraordinary measures to address it((/ul)). In turn, ((ul))desecuritizations are processes ‘in which a political community downgrades or ceases to treat something as an existential threat to a valued referent object, and reduces or stops calling for exceptional measures to deal with the threat’((/ul)) (Buzan and Wæver, cited in Coskun, 2008: 405). As such, the key aim of securitization theory is to identify what, when, where and how an issue is moved from being part of the normal environment of politics to becoming a threat to security and beyond the scope of normal politics – and vice versa (desecuritization). ((ul))The Copenhagen School securitization model((/ul)) gained considerable popularity during the 2000s, and was applied to the empirical study of a diverse range of security issues, including the War on Terror (Buzan, 2006), immigration, trafficking and minority rights (Huysmans, 1998, 2000; Aradau, 2004; Sasse, 2005; Jutila, 2006), societal insecurity, human rights (Morozov, 2002), environmental politics, HIV/AIDS (Elbe, 2006) and EU security (Huysmans, 2000; Balzacq, 2008; Neal, 2009). However, it((ul)) has also been the subject of a series of critiques and modifications from both its staunch supporters and ardent critics((/ul)). As Ciută notes, this critique has three main strands: conceptual (structural issues particularly related to speech act theory and other necessary components of the model); epistemological (how securitization views contexts); and normative (related to the shift from securitization speech acts to practices of the political and the liberal) (Ciută, 2009: 302). In light of these critiques, a ‘second-generation’ research agenda emerged among ‘contextual securitization scholars’ (Stritzel, 2012: 553), which is concerned with combining the formal aspects of the securitization model with a greater emphasis on examining the interrelationship between security politics and the contexts in which it operates. The aim of this agenda is to ‘construct a more comprehensive understanding of underlying processes’ by focusing on the ‘socio-linguistic and/or socio-political micro-dynamics of generating threats’ (Stritzel, 2012: 553; see also Balzacq, 2005, 2011; Guzzini, 2011; Salter, 2008; Stritzel, 2007, 2011; McDonald, 2008, 2011). Mirroring the original debate about the Copenhagen School model, the initial focus of such second-generation scholarship centred on analysing securitizing moves, while the inverse process of desecuritizing moves did not receive much attention (Coskun, 2008: 393). Recently, however, second-generation scholars have begun to delve more deeply into what it means to desecuritize an issue and ask what a desecuritized issue would look like (see Åtland, 2008; Aradau, 2004; Aras and Polat, 2008; Behnke, 2006; Cui and Li, 2011; Hansen, 2012; Knudsen, 2001; Roe, 2004; Wæver, 1995; Oelsner, 2005; Coskun, 2008; Salter, 2008; Klinke and Perombelon 2015). ((ul))((hl))These efforts have revealed a lack of basic consensus on the nature of desecuritization as a concept, model or process((/hl))((/ul)). As Coskun rightly points out, ‘th((ul))e Copenhagen School does not suggest an explicit framework for its analysis as it has done for securitization’; ‘different scholars have interpreted and implied desecuritization differently((/ul))’ (Coskun, 2008: 395). ((ul))((hl))The notion that to analyse desecuritization is simply to follow the Copenhagen School securitization model, but in reverse, has proven problema((/hl))((/ul))((ul))tic((/ul)).

Rather, there are many other ways that an issue or issue-area can be moved out of the sphere of security politics and into the sphere of regular politics’((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). For many scholars, desecuritizing moves have come to be considered as the product of a wider management process, rather than a singular speech act or debate((/ul)) (for more on this debate, see Roe, 2004, 2006; Jutila, 2006)."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":81}},{"tag":"Securitization theory is incorrect ","cite":"Messina 14 [Anthony M. Messina, John R.

Our above review of the collected works and other pertinent scholarship suggests that the securitization of immigration paradigm rests on two fairly solid pillars. First, as observed earlier, some mainstream politicians and most extreme right political actors within the immigration-receiving countries unquestionably have rhetorically linked domestic terrorist-related incidents to immigration since September 11. As Freeman, Givens, and Leal note, “immigration everywhere has become a higher-priority item on the public agenda and everywhere it has come to be linked to possibilities of terrorist attacks” (p. 9). Boswell similarly observes that the “terrorist attacks on the U.S. and the subsequent bombings in Madrid and London provided an opportunity for governments, politicians, and the media to correlate terrorism with immigration.”56 Nevertheless, this pillar has at least two conspicuous cracks. The first problem springs from the tendency of securitization of immigration scholars to impute the motives for so-called elite securitizing moves. ((ul))The suppositions that Western politicians have adopted rhetorical discourses that frame immigrants as an existential((/ul)), material, and/or physical ((ul))threat for self-serving political reasons((/ul)) and/or in order to enhance the legitimacy of their privileged position ((ul))have not been adequately documented((/ul)) within the securitization of immigration literature. ((ul))Few((/ul)) securitization of immigration ((ul))scholars have provided((/ul)), either through elite interviews or other data-collection methods, ((ul))empirical evidence((/ul)) concerning the motives that purportedly inspire elite securitization moves ((ul))and, instead, have repeatedly resorted to argument by assertion((/ul)). Along these lines it is necessary to document that political elites act purposefully whenever they rhetorically link immigration to security, since in the absence of such evidence a central tenet of securitization theory—that is, focusing events inspire strategically motivated elite securitizing speech acts—remains unproven. Yet another problem with the aforementioned perspective is the reality that ((ul))elite securitizing speech is not an especially recent phenomenon.((/ul)) As almost all securitization of immigration scholars readily acknowledge, numerous examples of elite securitization discourse are liberally sprinkled across the past four decades, if not even farther back in time. For securitization theory ((ul))this fact raises awkward and unanswered questions concerning what is ((/ul))ultimately ((ul))“normal” and “extraordinary” securitizing speech((/ul)), an important boundary that, insofar as it exists, signals if and when an elite campaign has been launched to transfer immigration-related issues from the realm of normal to that of emergency politics.57 For example, ((ul))if elite securitizing speech is((/ul)) more or less ((ul))a constant feature while securitizing measures on matters of immigration vary within the immigration-receiving countries((/ul)), then ((ul))how can we be confident that the former is a necessary and strategically inspired prelude to the latter((/ul))? Similarly, if elite securitizing speech is not especially new in the long history of mass migration to Europe and the United States, then when and how is it directly connected to recently inspired strategies to formulate and implement “extraordinary measures” on immigration-related questions? A second pillar of the securitization of immigration literature is that September 11 and subsequent terrorist events in Europe have precipitated numerous changes and/or revisions in state immigrant and immigration policies. The claim that contemporary state immigrant and immigration policies are now more exclusionary since September 11 and subsequent terrorist-related events in Europe is well documented. This said, to the degree that policy continuity rather than discontinuity on immigration generally prevails across the immigration-receiving countries since September 11—that is, post–September 11 terrorist events have accelerated but did not spark the recent illiberal turn in immigrant and immigration policy—then the assumption of many securitization theorists that political elites have gained greater policymaking autonomy as a result of domestic acts of terrorism is thrown into doubt.58 In short, if the immigration-receiving countries have not significantly altered their policies in the aftermath of terrorist acts but, rather, have “simply strengthened existing measures or implemented reforms,”59 then why do we need securitization theory to explain the latter phenomenon? With regard to the public’s role in the securitization process, the opinion survey evidence, as we have seen above, generally does not support the assumptions of securitization theory. ((ul))Although numerous citizens((/ul)) within the affected countries ((ul))are undoubtedly insecure about the presence of immigrants, several studies((/ul)) convincingly ((ul))demonstrate that contentious issues pertaining to((/ul)) the presence ((ul))of immigrants were already “securitized” for((/ul)) many if not most of ((ul))the public((/ul)) within the immigrationreceiving countries well before September 11 and other recent acts of domestic terrorism; that is, a substantial percentage of the public already perceived immigrants as negatively impacting employment, national culture/identity, and/or physical safety. ((ul))Especially problematic for securitization((/ul)) theory and its ((ul))claim that elites rhetorically framed a “convenient linkage” between national security and immigration((/ul)) after September 11—which has been received, comprehended, and broadly embraced by the public—((ul))is the fact that there is scant evidence of change((/ul)) ((ul))in the opinion survey((/ul)) data over time. Rather, ((ul))if anything, the survey evidence demonstrates((/ul)) the very opposite—((ul))that ((/ul))((ul))((hl))elite securitization moves((/hl))((/ul)) after September 11 appear to ((hl))have ((/hl))((ul))((hl))had little if any influence on public opinion((/hl))((/ul))((hl)),((/hl)) especially over the medium to long term. If September 11 and subsequent terrorist-related events did not precipitate or expand the public’s insecurities about immigration and immigrants, ((ul))((hl))then what ultimately does securitization theory usefully explain((/hl))((/ul))? Finally, ((ul))((hl))it is also problematic for securitization theory that the media’s role((/hl))((/ul)) in the process of securitizing immigration ((ul))((hl))is((/hl))((/ul)), at best, ambiguous and, at worst, ((ul))((hl))insignificant((/hl))((/ul)). ((ul))The paucity of concrete evidence for the((/ul)) view that the ((ul))media((/ul)) reflexively echo the securitizing cues of political elites ((ul))raises doubts about the veracity of the claim that they play a critical role((/ul)) in facilitating communication between securitizing agents and their target mass audience and, in so doing, “popularize” the former’s security rhetoric. ((ul))It is((/ul)), of course, ((ul))undeniable that the mass media frequently frame immigrants as a security threat((/ul)).60 Moreover, the possibility that whenever the media link terrorist events to immigration and immigrant settlement, the securitization agenda of at least some elites, and especially anti-immigrant political actors, is reinforced and to some extent legitimized cannot be easily dismissed. Nevertheless, in the absence of hard evidence that the media’s immigration frames influence more of the public to become illiberal and/or insecure—rather than simply making public discourse on immigration-related issues uncivil—it is safer than not to conclude that the media’s role in the securitization process is more modest than many securitization of immigration scholars typically claim."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":33}},{"tag":"Their assertion is non-falsifiable and wrong ","cite":"Gray 2014 – prof of politics and strategic studies, director of Centre for Strategic studies @ the University of ReadingColin S, Strategy and Culture, Strategy in Asia, Stanford U Press, p. 93","text":["((ul))The influence of culture simply asserts the identity of actors or organizations.

Within some academic disciplines there was a certain ‘distaste for [the] state’ (Low, 2003, p. 628). For society did not seem to operate anymore according to the rules of those older, modern, disciplinary categories, which concerned those radicals from the previous generation, like Foucault or Laclau and Mouffe. So new forms of analysis and radical politics were developed by new radicals, responding to the arrival of a new era (Featherstone, 2003; Anand et al., 2004). Hardt and Negri (2000), for example, talked up the idea that the new phase of capitalism operated far beyond the nation state, directly organising brain and body, through the complex interactions of globalised systems of trade and global media. Hardt and Negri therefore sought to work with the stakes of radical politics, as they saw them at the time, pre-crisis radicalising the post-modern categories4 of a global networked society itself, to create a borderless, less oppressive world. When these new radicals developed their manifesto, ((ul))it seemed an almost natural conclusion to seek to get rid of outdated modes of representational politics, instead radicalising the deterritorialised potential of the multitude into new trans-national forms of bio-power((/ul)), by intensifying this new phase of capitalism. This seemed logical, when all the analysis pointed to the way that globalised capitalism was going precrisis— states were holding back the revolutionary potential of the multitude.","As well as those radicals who advocate a global civil society ‘from below’, like Hardt and Negri and Mary Kaldor, there are of course those who advocate global civil society ‘from above’, in the form of some sort of global governance, such as the United Nations. Developing theories of globalisation in a particular way, many have argued for a move away ‘from the national to the cosmopolitan public sphere’, claiming that we are witnessing ‘the formation of a global polity’ (Ko¨hler, 1998, p. 231).

As David Chandler (2004, p. 320) said pre-crisis, such authors tend to look upon representational politics as a ‘mechanism of domination’. The belief is that trends in globalisation have shifted the way in which government is being and should be done.","((ul))Yet((/ul)) as Will Hutton (2009, p. 214) said post-crisis, on 5 December 2008:","to those who say that globalisation really constrains states, I say well look at the bail out of the last six or eight weeks.

In general, the assertion is correct, but the practice of counterfactuals is tricky. Hamid’s analysis of where the Libyan conflict was at when the US intervened is enlightening, but his conclusion that Libya would likely look like Syria today had the US not intervened is highly questionable. ((ul))Political prediction((/ul)), especially on rare events like mass atrocities or civil wars((ul)), is really, really hard((/ul)). And when you consider all the differences between Libya and Syria (total population, population density, salience of sectarian divides, regime configuration, military capability of opposition, etc.) along with all contingencies that could have occurred in the past four years, it is impossible to say with any certainty that Libya would bear a resemblance to Syria. Syria is merely a convenient standard of comparison because it’s an ongoing civil war in the Middle East, but saying Libya would be Syria doesn’t actually tell us that much about Libya or the effects of intervention. It’s not that the intervention can’t be justified with counterfactuals, but they need to be more carefully constructed.","The central thrust of Hamid’s essay is to deride what he calls consequentialism, or evaluating the efficacy of foreign policy based on events years after the initial intervention in the target location. For Hamid, such an approach is particularly problematic because it a policy cannot be retroactively deemed a mistake if the limited goal of the intervention is achieved initially. Therefore consequentialism creates an impossibly high bar for foreign policy decisions: unless a foreign policy results in a peaceful, liberal democracy, than it’s a failure. This is, however, a major straw man. ((ul))Certainly there are some critics that would deem the Libyan intervention a failure based on this standard, but Hamid lumps in those with reasonable concerns that a civil war((/ul)) (likely to continue for many years based on what we know about civil wars and foreign intervention) ((ul))at least partially produced by the NATO intervention will have more negative long-term effects on Libyans than Gaddafi’s intended repression. Worrying about consequences does not preclude making foreign policy decisions. Recognizing that every decision has potential positive and negative effects is no more than an accurate framework for analyzing policy((/ul)).","There are an additional two problems with Hamid’s argument here. First, ((ul))the dismissal of consequentialism is one of the central dynamics that leads ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Western policymakers to struggle with conflict prevention. Short-term thinking produces short-term solutions((/hl))((/ul))((hl)). ((/hl))((ul))((hl))Policymakers become trapped in a vicious circle of continual crises that overwhelm them and prevent longer-term thinking that could go a long way in preventing violence((/hl))((/ul)). Second, Hamid’s insistence that the initial moral righteousness of an intervention negates any negative effects, is deeply problematic. As many before me have argued, ((ul))focusing only on moral imperatives disincentives careful planning and allows policymakers to wash their hands of responsibility if the situation starts to go south((/ul)). Evaluating military interventions isn’t personal morality, because very rarely can doing the right thing in your personal life lead to deaths of thousands of people. Afghanistan is a valid example. The United States was going after the Taliban in response to 9/11 initially, but the war has had disastrous long-term effects for the country. It would take quite a bit of chutzpah to declare it a success.","((ul))((hl))Moral arguments without strategic and humanitarian((/hl))((/ul)) (writ large) ((ul))((hl))considerations are also prone to abuse, because liberal interventionists and neoconservatives aren’t actually that far apart((/hl))((/ul))((hl)):((/hl)) both believe in the wisdom of Western democracies to improve the world through military force.

To see why, we need to understand a bit more about the tradition of political thought to which these thinkers are seen to belong. Political realism is a distinctive family of approaches to the study, practice, and normative evaluation of politics.33 Despite their differences, these approaches tend to share four commitments. First, ((ul))realists think that there is something distinctive about politics((/ul)). It is a ((ul))realm of activity with \"its own character, purposes, and means((/ul)).\"34 ((ul))For realists,((/ul)) this ((ul))distinctiveness shapes the ((/ul))((ul))relationship between ethics and politics((/ul)). Some hold that politics is an amoral realm, while others claim that ((ul))((hl))it is ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))a realm with its own moral rules((/hl))((/ul)) that are ((ul))((hl))distinct from those in other spheres((/hl))((/ul)), while still others claim that politics is a realm in which ((ul))conventional or universal moral rules must be overridden and \"good\" political((/ul)) ((ul))actors must ((/ul))((ul))dirty their hands((/ul)). For instance, Machiavelli advises ((ul))rulers((/ul)) that they ((ul))must \"not depart from good((/ul)), when possible, ((ul))but know how to ((/ul))((ul))enter into evil when necessary((/ul)).\"35 Second, realists think that politics is agonistic or conflictual. They attribute this disagreement to a variety of causes, including human nature and the limits of rationality, competing identities and interests, and value pluralism.36 Morgenthau, for example, locates the causes of conflict in human nature - our lust for power and will to dominate. This \"aspiration for power over man\" is, for Morgenthau, both a cause of conflict and \"the essence of politics.\"37 ((ul))Whatever the causes of conflict((/ul)), realists hold that our ((ul))disagreements are not primarily intellectual and will not tend to be resolved through((/ul)) \"the ((ul))unforced force of the better argument((/ul)).''38 ((ul))Politics is necessary((/ul))((ul)) \"because we have to live and act alongside those with whom we disagree((/ul)).\"39 At their best, ((ul))((hl))political institutions can channel and manage this disagreement((/hl))((/ul)). But they cannot eliminate it. Third, political realists tend to prioritize the requirements of order and stability over the demands of justice. They see order as a fragile accomplishment. ((ul))((hl))Because disagreement and conflict are ineradicable, ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))order and stability are always vulnerable((/hl))((/ul)). They should never be understood as \"once-and-for-all achievements.''4° ((ul))While they((/ul)) ((ul))may be fragile, order and stability are often necessary ((/ul))((ul))preconditions for pursuing other political values, such as justice((/ul)). In realworld political contexts, \"((ul))justice purchased at the expense of order is((/ul)) ((ul))likely to prove self-defeating((/ul)).''41 This priority of order is best illustrated by Hobbes. His ((ul))((hl))Leviathan state must((/hl))((/ul)), above all else, ((ul))((hl))provide a stable solution to the ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))anarchy((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)), ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))conflict((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)), and ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))violence((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) of our natural condition. ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))Without order and stability, we are in no position to realize justice((/hl))((/ul)). Fourth, realists reject as utopian those approaches which seem to deny the distinctiveness of politics and the persistence of disagreement and conflict. 42 ((ul))Realists take aim at theories that fail to take seriously the psychological, sociological, and institutional constraints on political action((/ul)). Inattentive to these constraints, ((ul))utopian thinkers offer inadequate, and even dangerous, guidance for political reform((/ul)).43 Machiavelli famously contrasts his approach in The Prince with that of those who imagine \"republics and principalities that have never been seen or known to exist in truth; for it is so far from how one lives to how one should live that he who lets go of what is done for what should be done learns his ruin rather than his preservation.\"44 Morgenthau goes so far as to suggest that the struggle between utopianism and realism is the main plot of modern political thought.45 This ((ul))anti-utopianism is seen by many to be the most characteristic feature of political realism((/ul)). In the field of international relations, realism is sometimes defined almost entirely in terms of its opposition to utopianism.46 In its Judea-Christian form and many of its secular variants, apocalypticism is a kind of utopianism. It is a utopianism premised on a belief in the imminent end of the known world and the arrival of a radically new and better future.47 Understanding it in this way, we might expect that political realists would limit themselves to merely opposing or dismissing apocalyptic expectations.

How? Normative standards internal to ((ul))politics can be identified((/ul)), allowing us ((ul))to delineate legitimate politics from illegitimate domination or violence.

Accordingly, the programmatic challenge at hand is to see \"whether it is possible to develop a stable and compelling theory of legitimacy that occupies this ground between Realpolitik and moralism.\"8 A burgeoning scholarly literature suggests, at the very least, that many now deem this challenge worth taking up. For those familiar with IR realism and especially with the towering figure of Hans J. Morgenthau, the project's broad outlines should seem remarkably familiar. In the famous introduction to his widely read book Politics Among Nations: The Struggle for Power and Peace, with respect to the \"six principles of political realism\" Morgenthau described \"((ul))politics as an independent sphere((/ul)) ((ul))of action and understanding apart from other spheres, such as economics, ethics, aesthetics, or religion.\"((/ul)) He characterized ((ul))political realism((/ul)) by its distinctive acknowledgment of \"the autonomy of the political sphere,\" insisting that it ((ul))could still ((/ul))((ul))do justice to \"the moral significance of political action((/ul))((ul)).((/ul))\"9 His brand of realism, Morgenthau declared in another work, has nothing to do with realpolitik.10 To be sure, political realism cannot build directly on \"moralism,\" a misplaced effort to deny the autonomy of politics and the harsh (and normatively unsettling) fact that politics is fundamentally about the struggle for power.11 Yet \"this ((ul))realist defense of the autonomy of the political sphere ((/ul))against its subversion by other modes of thought ((ul))does not imply disregard for the existence and importance of these other modes of thought. It((/ul)) rather ((ul))implies that each be assigned their proper sphere and function((/ul)).\"12 ((ul))((hl))Realism is hostile not to morality((/hl))((/ul)) per se ((ul))((hl))but((/hl))((/ul)) only ((ul))((hl))to ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))misguided attempts to view politics as subordinate to its separate logic and laws((/hl))((/ul)). Because realism presupposes \"a pluralistic conception of man,\" based on the intuition that ((ul))human beings are((/ul)) ((ul))obliged to follow not only the laws of politics but those of morality((/ul)) (as well as economics, aesthetics, and so on), it grasps that anyone \"completely lacking in moral restraints\" is potentially a mere \"beast.\"13 Even ((ul))those engaged in the struggle for power cannot claim complete exemption from the laws of morality((/ul)). Morgenthau anticipated key features of the new political realism. However, my primary interest here is neither genealogy nor the assignment of scholarly credit. I instead focus on some subtle but significant differences between Morgenthau's views about the autonomy of politics and those now found among contemporary realists. I do so not for antiquarian reasons but because these differences are crucial for identifying the new realism's theoretical frailties. Despite a shared programmatic basis, the new realists part company with the \"old\" realist Morgenthau on a number of issues. There are good reasons, however, for doubting that their alternative realist theory represents unambiguous progress. To see why this is so, we must briefly return to Weimar, Germany, where Morgenthau first encountered what he described in an autobiographical essay in 1978 as \"a short book called The Concept of the Political that had a sensational impact upon German political thinking.\"14 Morgenthau was referring, of course, to Carl Schmitt's attempt to conceive of politics as a distinct sphere of activity, first sketched out in 1927 in the pages of the prestigious journal Achiv fur Sozialwissenschaft und Sozialpolitik and then in 1932 in a subsequent book. Throughout Morgenthau's career, he struggled to differentiate his ideas about the political from Schmitt's, whose own views, Morgenthau presciently grasped as a young jurist, were conceptually flawed as well as politically irresponsible. Though I remain unsure whether Morgenthau ever succeeded in offering a fully satisfactory rejoinder to Schmitt, his efforts to do so provide useful lessons for contemporary realism. ((ul))Present-day realists ((/ul))need to distinguish their efforts from Schmitt's legacy more effectively than they so far have achieved.15 As they struggle to do so, they ((ul))can learn from Morgenthau, who sketched((/ul)) the ((ul))outlines of a ((/ul))((ul))nuanced political ethics((/ul))((ul)) not only ((/ul))((ul))superior((/ul)) to Schmitt's account of the ((ul))nexus between politics and morality but also directly ((/ul))((ul))pertinent to contemporary realism((/ul))((ul)).

Consider the event-driven and transitory character of post-Cold War intellectual commentary: the decade of the 1990s, variously described as threatless, flat, global, the end of history;2 the following half decade, as pervasively insecure, a perfect storm of terror, WMD proliferation, rogue and failing states; and the more recent emphasis on declining relative American power and emergent multipolarity. This recent contender for intellectual primacy spans observers as disparate as Robert Kagan, Fareed Zacharia, John Ikenberry (\"In the decades to come, America's unipolar power will give way to a more bipolar, multipolar, or decentralized distribution of power\"), and the National Intelligence Council (see notes 3-6 of chapter 1). This consensus is reinforced by the global economic crises, which in the dominant view accelerates the erosion of unipolarity3 but could cut in the opposite direction, undermining governance and power in \"rising\" states (and regional institutions) now experiencing reductions in growth, and reinforcing those states with strong and diversified economies, robust civil society, and legitimate political institutions capable of responding to economic stress. Indeed, expectations of a multipolar future have provoked a reaction among liberals and neocons, who predict American renewal and restored primacy.

Peter Schwartz and Doug Randall have written that \"anticipating strategic surprise is ultimately valuable in terms of preparedness. Organizations that have thought about such significant issues are much more likely to discern important, emerging trends early on; identify the indicators that tell them something big is happening; and put in place the sensors to detect strategic surprise as it unfolds.

The hedgehog \"foresaw growing tension with Russia that would culminate in interethnic violence, a Russian energy embargo and military intervention to protect Russians, and the forced seeding of territory to mother Russia.\"16 Tetlock concludes that \"wariness of facile generalizations helped this fox forge an integrative set of economic and political expectations that were more accurate than that of most other specialists.\"17","One can easily understand Tetlock's enthusiasm for the fox's \"more accurate\" Ukraine forecast: most in accord with Ukraine's economics and politics in 1992, with a Western orientation offering real promise for growth and stability, and a weakened Russia in no position to prevent this. It was closest to an extrapolation. It still looked to be correct in 2005, when the book was published. And it issued from an inquiring intellectual style that Tetlock favors. Nor should one expect decision-makers to have premised strategy for Ukraine and Russia on the hedgehog's predicted discontinuity, with relatively little \"current intelligence\" to back it up, especially when everything about international politics-in 1992-seemed to be going our way. But the value proposition for alternative futures has very little to do with predictive accuracy; it is to position seemingly improbable but consequential outcomes on our radar, to prudentially consider how our favored future might go awry, to make us more attentive to often subtle indicators that perfectly reasonable expectations are becoming less realistic. In the Ukraine case, taking the hedgehog more seriously might have left us less flat-footed when the \"discontinuity\" became reality. It also appears that our hedgehog had the intellectual equipment to understand something about Ukraine and its external position that our fox did not-its fragmented identities and loyalties, its ineffective government, and its location on the border of an aggrieved and powerful state, with NATO membership for Ukraine highly unlikely-that enabled him to extend his view beyond the unipolar and transitory conditions of the 1990s.","The fox-versus-hedgehog contrast of styles is a well-known problem in attempting to anticipate fundamental change, often expressed as the unavoidable choice between missed signals (foxes) and false signals (hedgehogs). The intellectually conservative foxes expect business as usual, tend to underpredict change, and, because tomorrow is more often than not much like today, are usually right, but often unexceptional, and risk being devastatingly wrong. The intellectually bold hedgehogs, in deploying elegant theories of causation, leap ahead of the stream of events to predict big changes, confident that the future will eventually catch up with their forecasts. If they're wrong, which they often are, they can still be usefully wrong. The Ukraine prediction, made in 1992, was wrong until 2013, when it was revealed as brilliantly correct. The downside with hedgehogs, of course, is that they overpredict and are fuzzy on timing, are too self-confident to learn from their mistakes or to modify their views in light of new information, yet are often more effective in debate than the self-debating foxes. ","Without declaring myself as inclined toward either style, in constructing groups of experts for scenario building, it's useful to have both. The opportunity to speculate about plausible long-term futures should free the foxes from risk-averse analysis and data-driven extrapolations. The explicit discussion of assumptions, and the invitation to imagine futures premised on alternate theories, should bump the hedgehogs off their well-worn paths. The interaction of experts and policymakers with contrasting cognitive styles, skill sets, and national identities should, if done right, produce both seriousness of purpose and intellectual playfulness, a collective willingness to entertain alternate points of view, and a commitment to build the best case possible for divergent futures. The overall style of the conversation should be foxlike (open-minded, inquiring, imaginative, Bayesian), but prepared like hedgehogs to entertain big ideas about the extent and direction of change.

Is it rooted in universal principles, or is it socially constructed? What is the role of morality and ethics in international life, and what are the most effective means of promoting these goods? Is there such a thing as universal truth, or is truth contingent upon interest or social construction? Are ethical standards universal, or do they differ among different realms, such as private morality, economic relations, domestic politics, and relations among nations? How do power and the threat of force relate to citizenship and moral obligation? ((ul))Classical security studies also pose questions regarding life and death. ((/ul))In addition, ((ul))it is evident that classical strategic studies and realism are still very relevant to political and international life.((/ul)) First, ((ul))who can reasonably avow that self-interest and the will to power((/ul)) (at both the individual and the state levels) ((ul))have disappeared as important aspects of human motivations and action?((/ul)) ((ul))Even if wars are less prevalent than in the past, and if the theorists of democratic peace are on to something, the fact remains that organized violence remains part of our world; ((/ul))and it lies in the background of states and international orders within which the practice of democratic peace prevails. 64 (In other words, democratic peace must ultimately be backed by power, whether the power comes from international institutions - which have not had an unblemished record thus far in protecting peace and justice - or the commitment of powerful states or alliances such as NATO f5 Second, such rogue states and \"revolutionary regimes\" as Iran and North Korea are on the verge of possessing nuclear weapons as of this writing. If they attain these weapons, the nations within the realm of democratic peace will be obligated to deploy the doctrine of deterrence against them. Some strategic thinkers are now even reconsidering the previously rejected doctrine of the threat of limited nuclear war to deter such regimes.66 Third, as many advocates of human rights acknowledge, sometimes military intervention is needed to secure those rights in the face of tyranny. And if such intervention does not come, the consequences are obvious, as the graves, hospitals, and rivers of blood in such places as Nazi Germany, Armenia, Darfur, Rwanda, Burma, Iran, and the Gulags of Communism have shown. Accordingly, ((ul))sometimes peace is preserved not by pacifism or extreme reluctance to use arms, but rather by a plausible deterrent force.((/ul)) 67 If so, ((ul))peace and war studies are not necessarily in opposition to one another, but can constitute two sides of the same coin((/ul)). As MIT's Stephen Van Evera has remarked, most theories about the causes of war are also about theories of peace- and vice versa. 68 Fourth, some scholars have empirically demonstrated that even liberal states with republican forms of government are considerably more likely to follow the strictures of international law when it serves their interests to do so than when it does not. 69 And fifth, what do we make of conflict that arises from the animosity of nonliberal states or groups that lie outside the realm of democratic peace? Sometimes this conflict is itself a product of the very practices that contribute to democratic peace - supporting classic realism's grasp of the tragic nature of life and international relations. As Philip Bobbitt has demonstrated in two magnum opuses, the rise of \"market states\" in the late-twentieth century- the products of economic interdependency - helped to fuel the jihadist terrorism that now threatens those very states. The economic relations and activities of market states extend beyond traditional physical borders, embedding market polities in international networks that sometimes defy the limits and perquisites of sovereignty. (Market states are prime examples of the decentering of the state.) This expansion of economic activity and power alienates fundamentalist Islamists, but also provides networks of communication and information that Islamic terrorists use to recruit members and obtain technological knowledge. In many ways, liberal democracy's conflict with terrorism epitomizes the tensions and dilemmas that beset international relations theory today: Dispute reigns over whether the conflict should be considered a war or a law enforcement matter, and the legal status of non-state terrorists who violate the rules of war is a matter of continuous dispute. 70 Is the threat posed by terrorism real, or is it also influenced by our constructions of the threat? The confrontation with international terrorism provides both vindication and refutation of all schools of security studies. But at the very least, realism and traditional security studies have something important to say about terrorism on a variety of levels. Constructivism has usually been used to question realism's suspicion of international organizations and order. But a constructivist sensibility can also cut in the other direction. For example, some commentators have observed that some liberal internationalists and peace advocates project their own beliefs in goodwill and peace onto others whose purposes are much less benign. (Among a multitude of examples are Woodrow Wilson's faith in the League of Nations, Neville Chamberlain's views toward Hitler, Jimmy Carter's earlier views toward the Soviet Union, and George W. Bush's earlier assumptions regarding Vladimir Putin.) Accordingly, constructivism can be used to question the assumptions of all schools of IR, including its own when some of its practitioners unduly dismiss realism's claims. ((ul))Realism((/ul))- including the \"moral realism\" as we have conceptualized of it in this book - and ((ul))((hl))the traditional core of security studies remain highly relevant, even if responsible scholars and policy makers must account for alternative understandings.((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) And since the project of this book deals with pedagogy, we are not obligated to pick a horse in this race.((/ul)) It is enough to acknowledge that ((ul))the tenets of realism and traditional security studies are important regardless of one's policy or normative position,((/ul)) and that such tenets broaden and deepen the knowledge to which students are exposed in campus life today. ((ul))((hl))Security studies programs remain hospitable to realism, and it is not isolated from the university or singular in its approach.((/hl))((/ul))((hl)) In general, ((/hl))((ul))((hl))the security studies programs that we asked about are sources of productive friction to varying extents.((/hl))((/ul))"],"stats":{"highlightedWords":87}},{"tag":"Securitization is key to promote action to stop existential threats because it promotes action over ignorance","cite":"Bell 17 – Duncan Bell, Reader in Political Thought and International Relations at the University of Cambridge 17 (\"Security and Poverty: On Realism and Global Justice\", Academia, Available Online from https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/49009820/Bell_-_Security_and_Poverty.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1531597032&amp;Signature=2Ex2rXBrUF0JbngzO9iZiZj6Bj4%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DSecurity_and_Poverty_On_Realism_and_Glob.pdf, Dsen)","text":["Motivating redistribution could assume various forms, with appeals made to economic self-interest, prudence, sympathy, overlapping identities, or the claims of reason and the sense of justice.40 The analytical realist will respond that none of these will gain traction insofar as they clash with the kind of political feasibility constraints outlined in the previous section. Indeed ((ul))from a realist perspective, the most effective way to motivate political interest in the alleviation of global poverty is to reframe it as a national security issue. ((/ul))Should, then, cosmopolitans – or others keen to address global poverty systematically – support the 'securitization' of poverty? ((ul))To securitize an issue is to refigure it as security concern and in so doing to lift it above the routines of 'normal' politics. ((/ul))An issue that has been successfully securitized demands urgent political attention, the (re)allocation of extraordinary resources, time, and energy.41 ((ul))Security issues have been classified as such by 'securitizing actors' – often but not always agents of the state – as presenting a threat to the political community.((/ul)) From this perspective, '[s]ecurity issues cannot be reduced to the existence of objective possibilities of harm. Claims about security and ((ul))threats are made politically efficacious through the authoritative declaration of an “existential threat” to the object concerned, and through their acceptance as “security issues” in these terms by a relevant audience'.((/ul)) The object concerned is usually the state, and the threat can be to its autonomy, economic capacity, identity, and so on. ((ul))The effects of a successful process of securitization are powerful. 'By uttering \"security\" a state-representative moves a particular development into a specific area, and thereby claims a special right to use whatever means are necessary to block it'.((/ul))42 The process can be seen, for example, in the way in which migration is increasingly treated as a security problem.43 Although ((ul))many contemporary realists employ a very narrow conception of security – one that focuses primarily on the material capabilities of states((/ul)) – ((ul))a wider understanding of the realist tradition allows us to see the issue in a different light.((/ul)) The key here is the essentially contested character of two key concepts fundamental to the structuring of contemporary politics: the 'national interest' and 'security'.44 Their scope and content are malleable. Classical realists, such as Arnold Wolfers, recognized that the national interest was 'an ambiguous symbol', one that is interpreted in various ways by diverse groups of actors in different contexts.45 The same is true of security. Such((ul)) a position is entailed by constructivist ontological commitments. This conceptual elasticity creates a space for refiguring the status of global poverty.((/ul)) '[A]ny sector, at any particular time, might be the most important focus for concerns about threats, vulnerabilities, and defense'.46 If successful, 'securitization' would propel global poverty to the forefront of government decision-making, harnessing resources currently unavailable. Indeed a number of issues that were previously regarded as primarily humanitarian (or moral) in character are already the subject of powerful securitizing moves. There is an illuminating precedent here: ((ul))HIV/AIDS. During the mid-2000s, there was a concerted attempt by a number of states (above all the United Kingdom), international institutions, health care bodies, and relief organizations, to securitize the disease. It was partially successful, insofar as it rose high on the international policy agenda (especially at the UN).((/ul)) While it has now been largely 'de-securitised', the earlier moment arguably led to a considerable amount of resources and attention being directed towards addressing the pandemic.47 Meanwhile, efforts continue to securitize climate change.48 Some ((ul))political theorists might baulk at this argument, fearing the spectre of instrumentality((/ul))((ul))((hl)). It lies outside the scope of this chapter to engage with the complex ethical issues surrounding deliberate dissimulation in the name of a greater good. However, ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))in this case the issue need not arise((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) ((ul))The UNDP already recognises that global poverty is a security issue((/ul)), insofar as it threatens the stability of political communities and aggravates conflict.49 Moreover, this is a theme already highlighted by a number of political theorists, although they discuss it only in passing.50 The argument is straightforward, though controversial: poverty leads to destabilizing social disruption and state failure in strategically important or volatile parts of the world. Today, it is frequently argued that the global poor and disposed are ripe targets for recruitment to antiwestern (and especially Islamist) forces, and poor states are susceptible to takeover or rebellion. A further argument is that the mass migration triggered by poverty is itself a political threat to the west, and in particular Europe – an argument that was widely invoked in the migration crisis of 2015. Of course, even if it were successful, the securitization of global poverty would not be a panacea.51 It would target some areas more than others, and there would invariably be numerous problems with implementation. There are two different ways in which global poverty could be securitized. In the first, one or more major powers would come to view global poverty as a security threat, and act accordingly. In the second, assorted international organisations – and in particular the United Nations Security Council – would identify it as such, and act accordingly.52 From an analytical realist perspective, the former is more plausible. It is probably the only feasible way in which the most powerful states – in this world, not a world run by 'saints' – could be motivated within a foreseeable timeframe to systematically address global poverty. The key question in the present context is whether the securitization of poverty is normatively desirable, whether cosmopolitans (or others who believe that the massive redistribution of global wealth is required) should advocate it. ((ul))Most scholars of the subject regard securitization as almost always morally and politically problematic. This is because to securitize a domain is to shield it from the scrutiny of democratic deliberation, the rule of law, and public accountability.((/ul)) Claudia Aradau, for example, contends that securitization is dangerous both in terms of the short-circuiting of democratic procedures and because it is a process that necessarily leads to the production of 'enemy' others who need to be contained or destroyed.53 Discussing the securitization of HIV/AIDS, Stefan Elbe warns that it 'pushes responses to the disease away from civil society toward the much less transparent workings of the military and intelligence organizations, which also possess the power to override human rights and civil liberties'.54 Predicated on the construction of urgent threats and dangerous enemies, it further empowers the least democratically accountable elements of the state apparatus (and certain private agents). ((ul))Securitization, that is, can undermine the very thing it claims to protect. ((/ul))Political ((ul))theorists hardly need reminding of the threats presented by security-obsessed states. The politics of fear has been a recurrent theme in modern history.((/ul))55 The fraught debate over the necessary trade-offs between liberty and security has taken on a renewed vigour in recent years, reflecting the assault on human rights – at home and abroad – pursued under the banner of the 'war on terror'. Increasingly draconian legislation and security practices have eroded basic liberties and stoked fear about the future of democracy. Robert Goodin goes as far as to argue that the behaviour of political elites in a number of countries, most notably the United States, can be classified as terrorism.56 The securitization of poverty, then, is a project beset with ethical and political dangers – dangers that threaten, in particular, the already fragile norms and values of constitutional democracy. ((ul))((hl))The conventional view of securitization is premised on a (Schmittian) ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))binary between 'normal politics' and 'states of emergency'((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul))57 More recent work on securitization has challenged this position, chiefly through taking greater account of the dynamics of audience reception, non-linguistic practices, and (perhaps above all) by reconceptualising security as scalar not binary. This in turn has opened up space for reassessing the normative dimensions of securitization, and in particular for asking whether, and under what conditions, securitizing acts might be legitimate. This line of argument assumes two main forms. First, it offers an empirical critique of the claim that securitization necessarily involves the effacement of democratic politics. Secondly, it challenges the normative claim that securitization is intrinsically an illegitimate phenomenon. Rita ((ul))Floyd has developed the most thorough normative account of securitization((/ul)), arguing that it can be justified when three conditions (derived from Just War theorizing) are met: ((ul))1. There must be an objective existential threat, which is to say a threat than endangers the survival of an actor or an order. 2. The referent object of security must be morally legitimate, which is the case only when the referent object is conducive to human well-being defined as the satisfaction of human needs. 3. The security response must be appropriate to the threat in question, which is to say that (a) the security response must be measured in accordance with the capabilities of the aggressor and (b) the securitizing actor must be sincere in his or her own intentions.((/ul)) 58 Securitization, she writes, 'has no intrinsic value; what matters are the consequences of securitisations alone'.59 What, then, of global poverty? Securitizing areas previously framed in humanitarian or developmental terms further extends the rights and responsibilities of the security apparatuses of the most powerful states, whilst simultaneously instilling anxiety in their populations by adding to the already long list of purported security threats. This danger is exacerbated by the very malleability of the term security. If global poverty is securitised, along with HIV/AIDS, then where will the line be drawn? Climate change discourse presents a parallel case. ((ul))((hl))These are the kinds of securitization moves which are likely to have significant effects in redirecting state action((/hl))((/ul))((ul)). ((/ul))Here we glimpse the Janus-faced character of securitization. On the one hand, this is a welcome development – and it was greeted as such by many environmental scientists – for it signals a willingness by well-placed agents to challenge intransigent attitudes to climate change. Yet it should also generate concern, for it can be seen as a powerful salvo in the conflict over which government agencies will determine the scope of state responses to environmental crisis, a conflict which with the resources available to them (including the normative resources generated by the claim to provide the overarching public good of security) national security agencies are well placed to win. Neo-realists generally have very little to say about such matters, intent as they are on evacuating realism of normative content. (Although it is worth remembering that they are typically skeptical of the discursive extension of 'security' beyond its traditional narrow confine, and as such they implicitly endorse the critique of securitization). While ((ul))some realists have been complicit in the creation of a climate of fear((/ul)), both during the Cold war and today, a number of the 'classical' ((ul))realists were extremely wary of the dangers of militarism, and the spreading threat to democracy posed by the creeping expansion of the security-oriented elements of the state.((/ul)) It was, after all, President Eisenhower, a conservative realist, who warned of the dangers of the 'military-industrial' complex. Hans Morgenthau, as several contributors to this book have argued, frequently insisted on the need to carefully monitor the line between political and military power, and to foster a civil society in which active dissent was seen as a positive virtue of the citizenry, not as a threat to social solidarity or political will.60 ((ul))((hl))Realism, then, at least contains some resources to challenge securitization and threats to democracy.((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))"],"stats":{"highlightedWords":84}},{"tag":"Securitization ((ul))fails((/ul)) – only implications of security ((ul))matter((/ul))","cite":"Bell 18 - reader in political thought and international relations at the University of Cambridge and fellow of Christ’s College (Duncan Bell; Politics Recovered; “Security and Poverty” On Realism and Global Justice; pgs. 308-313)//TS","text":["Motivating redistribution can assume various forms, with appeals made to economic self-interest, prudence, sympathy, overlapping identities, or the claims of reason and the sense of justice. 39 The analytical realist will respond that none of these forms will gain traction insofar as they clash with the kind of political feasibility constraints outlined in the previous section.

The conceptualization of “neoliberalism” as a “hegemonic” project does not need refining by adding a splash of Foucault. Perhaps we should try to do without the concept of “neoliberalism” altogether, because it might actually compound rather than aid in the task of figuring out how the world works and how it changes. One reason for this is that, between an overly economistic derivation of political economy and an overly statist rendition of governmentality, ((ul))stories about “neoliberalism” manage to reduce the understanding of social relations to a residual effect of hegemonic projects((/ul)) and/or governmental programmes of rule (see Clarke, 2004a). ((ul))Stories about “neoliberalism” pay little attention to the pro-active role of socio-cultural processes in((/ul)) provoking changes in modes of ((ul))governance((/ul)), policy, and regulation. Consider the example of the restructuring of public services such as health care, education, and criminal justice in the UK over the last two or three decades. This can easily be thought of in terms of a “hegemonic” project of “neoliberalization”, and certainly one dimension of this process has been a form of anti-statism that has rhetorically contrasted market provision against the rigidities of the state. But in fact these ongoing changes in the terms of public-policy debate involve a combination of different factors that add up to a much more dispersed populist reorientation in policy, politics, and culture. These factors include changing consumer expectations, involving shifts in expectations towards public entitlements which follow from the generalization of consumerism; the decline of deference, involving shifts in conventions and hierarchies of taste, trust, access, and expertise; and the refusals of the subordinated, referring to the emergence of anti-paternalist attitudes found in, for example, women’s health movements or anti-psychiatry movements. They include also the development of the politics of difference, involving the emergence of discourses of institutional discrimination based on gender, sexuality, race, and disability. This has disrupted the ways in which welfare agencies think about inequality, helping to generate the emergence of contested inequalities, in which policies aimed at addressing inequalities of class and income develop an ever more expansive dynamic of expectation that public services should address other kinds of inequality as well (see Clarke, 2004b).","None of these populist tendencies is simply an expression of a singular “hegemonic” project of “neoliberalization”. They are effects of much longer rhythms of socio-cultural change that emanate from the bottom-up.

((ul))Processes of privatization, market liberalization, and de-regulation have often followed an ((/ul))((ul))ironic pattern((/ul))((ul)) in so far as they have been triggered by citizens’ movements arguing from the left((/ul)) of the political spectrum ((ul))against the rigidities of statist((/ul)) forms of social ((ul))policy and welfare provision in the name of greater autonomy((/ul)), equality, and participation (e.g. Horwitz, 1989).

The emergence and generalization of this populist ethos has much longer, deeper, and wider roots than those ascribed to “hegemonic neoliberalism”. And it also points towards the extent to which easily the most widely resonant political rationality in the world today is not right-wing market liberalism at all, but is, rather, the polyvalent discourse of “democracy” (see Barnett and Low, 2004).","((ul))Recent theories of “neoliberalism” have retreated from the appreciation of the long-term rhythms of socio-cultural change((/ul)), which Stuart Hall once developed in his influential account of Thatcherism as a variant of authoritarian populism.

All of these might be thought of as variants of what we might want to call bottom-up governmentality. This refers to the notion that non-state and non-corporate actors are also engaged in trying to govern various fields of activity, both by acting on the conduct and contexts of ordinary everyday life, but also by acting on the conduct of state and corporate actors as well. Rose (1999, pp. 281–284) hints at the outlines of such an analysis, at the very end of his paradigmatic account of governmentality, but investigation of this phenomenon is poorly developed at present. ((ul))Instead, the trouble-free((/ul)) amalgamation of Foucault’s ideas into the Marxist ((ul))narrative of “neoliberalism” sets up a ((/ul))((ul))simplistic image((/ul))((ul)) of the world divided between the forces of hegemony and the spirits of subversion((/ul)) (see Sedgwick, 2003, pp. 11–12). And ((ul))clinging to this image only makes it all the ((/ul))((ul))more difficult((/ul))((ul)) to acknowledge the possibility of ((/ul))((ul))positive political action((/ul))((ul)) that does not conform to a ((/ul))((ul))romanticized picture of rebellion((/ul)), contestation, or protest against domination (see Touraine, 2001).","Theories of “neoliberalism” are unable to recognize the emergence of new and innovative forms of individualized collective action because their critical imagination turns on a simple evaluative opposition between individualism and collectivism, the private and the public. The ((ul))radical academic discourse of “neoliberalism” frames the relationship between collective action and individualism ((/ul))((ul))simplistically((/ul))((ul)) as an opposition between the good and the bad. In confirming a narrow account of liberalism, understood((/ul)) primarily ((ul))as an economic doctrine of free markets((/ul)) and individual choice, ((ul))there is a ((/ul))((ul))peculiar convergence((/ul))((ul)) between the radical academic left and the right-wing interpretation of liberal thought((/ul)) exemplified by Hayekian conservatism. By obliterating the political origins of modern liberalism—understood as answering the problem of how to live freely in societies divided by interminable conflicts of value, interest, and faith—((ul))the discourse of “neoliberalism” reiterates a((/ul)) longer ((ul))problem((/ul)) for radical academic theory ((ul))of being unable to account for its own normative priorities((/ul)) in a compelling way. And ((ul))by denigrating the value of individualism as just an ideological ploy by the right, the pejorative vocabulary of “neoliberalism” invites us to take solace in an image of collective decision-making as a((/ul)) practically and ((ul))normatively unproblematic procedure((/ul))."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":16}},{"tag":"“Neoliberalism” is a politically useless term that occludes alternatives","cite":"Daniel RODGERS 18, the Henry Charles Lea Professor of History Emeritus at Princeton University [“Reply: Fault Lines,” Dissent, January 22, 2018, https://www.dissentmagazine.org/blog/neoliberalism-forum-daniel-rodgers-reply]","text":["What’s wrong with the word “neoliberalism?” A lot, if these responses are to be believed. Used casually ((ul))“neoliberalism”((/ul)) bundles, ((ul))abstracts((/ul)), ((ul))and totalizes. It masks vagueness under faux precision. It imputes a trajectory to history that is overdetermined and simplistic((/ul)). It smears; it conjures up witches. ((ul))It cranks up the heat under the left’s internal((/ul)) ideological ((ul))differences without shedding((/ul)) corresponding ((ul))light. It lures us into anthropomorphizing “neoliberalism” as itself a historical actor((/ul)). Even Mike Konczal, who defends its use, worries that it “generally confuses more than it enlightens.”","Worse, N. D. B.

((/ul))((ul))((hl))It ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))“erases” even as it constructs((/hl))((/ul)). Like other theories of history that have thrived on the left, ((ul))it presents the history of the white, economically developed West as a universal narrative for the world. It struggles to explain the tsunamis of nativism, racism, and xenophobia that are everywhere disrupting politics except as bastard side-effects of global market liberalization((/ul)) and economic transformation. Connolly makes the case for the weakness of “neoliberalism” as a totalizing term for understanding the recent history of the United States. The anthropologist James ((ul))Ferguson has written acutely about the limitations of its application to contemporary Africa. With criticisms like these, caution is in order((/ul)).","What’s right with ((ul))the term((/ul)) “neoliberalism?” It ((ul))opens up the possibility of analytical vocabularies beyond the mid-twentieth century liberal/conservative antonyms that have now outlasted their utility. It ((/ul))((ul))restores economy to the forefront((/ul))((ul)) of critical analysis after decades when it tended to slip away behind even vaguer and more totalizing notions of “culture” or “power.”((/ul)) Above all its asset lies in its capaciousness. “Neoliberalism,” writes Julia Ott, “references much of what distinguishes our contemporary moment in history, both in this country and around the world.” It “acknowledges the deep connections between a great many (certainly not all) of our most pressing challenges.”","My aim in cautioning against overreliance on the term “neoliberalism” was not to downplay these interconnections. In suggesting the need for deeper reflection on how the term came into being, what work it does, and what confusions it may conceal, I was not proposing that we “silo” off its elements into mutually independent pieces. Nor was I suggesting that the phenomena it links together under the tent of a single word have no mutual “repercussions” on each other. My goal was to encourage a deeper discussion about how those elements of power, ideas, structures, and culture actually interact.","((ul))The phenomenon we call “neoliberalism” rose from multiple sources, not from any single one. How its libertarian public face and its actual encouragement of the reaccumulation of wealth and power were made to fit together is an empirical question that the term in itself cannot explain. How state action was publicly devalued((/ul)) as a threat to freedom, ((ul))even as state power was being enlisted by institutional actors who ostensibly decried it, can’t be answered by a noun((/ul)), no matter how elastic or capacious. ((ul))Analysis that only disconnects leaves us merely with fragments((/ul)). We must study “how [neoliberalism’s] social relations develop,” Ott writes. We need to see the ways its faces overlap and the “interplay” between them, Konczal argues. I agree. ((ul))We need, above all, a clearer sense of the “actually existing relationships” between the elements that the umbrella term embraces((/ul)), I wrote. But ((ul))without first asking what exactly is being linked together, and through what shifting combinations of actors, institutions, structures, and contingencies those conjunctions have been formed, those relationships can get ((/ul))((ul))blurred((/ul)) even in analysis as lucid as Ott’s.","((ul))A single omnibus noun can’t tell us what we urgently need to know((/ul)) about the vulnerabilities within the cluster of intersecting and overlapping things we call “neoliberalism.” ((ul))((hl))It can’t help us see more clearly the fault lines it contains or the multiple points of historical inflection that gave it shape. It can’t identify the points of reinforcement((/hl))((/ul)), highlight the regions of strain and contradiction, ((ul))or sort out the ((/ul))((ul))contingent relationships((/ul))((ul)) from the more enduring ones. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))Politically((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), the((/ul)) very ((ul))bagginess((/ul)) and capaciousness ((ul))of the term “((/ul))((ul))((hl))neoliberalism((/hl))((/ul))((ul))” ((/ul))((ul))((hl))weakens((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) its ability to spell out((/ul)) for us neoliberalism’s ((ul))((hl))alternatives((/hl))((/ul))((ul)), or the ideas and projects that might effectively counter the forces it identifies((/ul)).","It is in concrete cases like the Citizens United decision, or the bankruptcy crises that overwhelmed New York City in the 1970s and Detroit in the 1910s, or the dramatically told stories in Matthew Desmond’s Evicted (2016), that the ground beneath the abstractions of “neoliberalism” become visible. Of course, instances like these must be generalized and connected. Mid-level analytical terms need to be sharpened and deployed. Larger vectors of economic, cultural, and institutional power must be spelled out. But is it too trite to remind ourselves that disaggregation and integration are both crucially important to serious analysis?","((ul))The problem is((/ul)) not the term “neoliberalism” itself but the danger of its overuse, ((ul))its potential crowding out of other terms, and our expectation that it do more for us than any covering noun can do((/ul)). We are at a new moment in left-intellectual circles of high conceptual aggregation. Is it a sign of strength? A whisper of despair? A mark of faddishness? Or is it an occasion when we might recalibrate the amount of stock we place in our neologism of the moment?","“What kind of political work do we expect from words?” Ott writes. Not everything that politics requires, of course. ((ul))((hl))Politics needs ideas, ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))policies((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)), projects, and agendas((/hl))((/ul)). But it needs the power of language as well. Words name and analyze. They make alliances possible. Historically, words that gain political traction have drawn heavily on immediate experience. Freedom is a seat at a lunch counter where your kind of people have never been allowed to sit before. Injustice is the blow of the cop’s truncheon on your head or his bullet through your unresisting body. Fairness is a better wage when the monopolists’ and stock holders’ returns are swelling over the troughs. ((ul))When political words work, they aggregate((/ul)) these ((ul))instances into larger claims and causes. They integrate experience with causal explanations and practical programs. They create larger words that can impel((/ul)) loyalty, ((ul))action((/ul)), ((ul))even love. ((/ul))((ul))((hl))The “neoliberal” right is full of words that hold for its followers magical powers like these: freedom, choice, responsibility, dignity, self-reliance, innovation, flexibility((/hl))((/ul)). Many were stolen from the left, but they now shape the political word-space of the right with powerful effects.","((ul))((hl))Neoliberal is ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))not that sort of word((/hl))((/ul)). It came into its current currency as a word of analysis rather than mobilization, Tim Shenk reminds us. But analytical words that gain political traction need powerful, visualizable, and experientially graspable legs, too. The “deep state” honeycombed with self-interested bureaucrats, the dangers of “job-killing” regulation, the “free riders” in our economic midst: these were brilliant linguistic creations, many of them invented in economics faculty seminars, that were simultaneously analytical and experiential. In the arena of day-to-day politics, Shenk writes, the word “neoliberal” can help activists on the left identify their enemies. But, frankly, almost any word can be made to do that work. If, resisting the pressures to bundle everything that matters into the term “neoliberalism,” the twitter threads, the podcasts, and the discussion boards are full of experiments with analytically acute but more experientially resonant language for the left than that, more power to them."],"stats":{"highlightedWords":77}}]}
