((ul))((hl))In the wake of news that ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))up to 300 refugees((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) are reportedly under investigation for terror ties, it’s prudent to pause refugee entry((/hl))((/ul)) for a few months to review our vetting processes. There is no reason for the Trump administration to simply trust that the Obama administration struck the right balance between security and compassion. To understand the collective importance of these measures, ((ul))((hl))it’s vital to understand the basics of how the terror threat actually manifests itsel((/hl))((/ul))((ul))f((/ul)). All the recent talk of “lone wolves” in many ways exaggerates the threat of the individual while minimizing the importance of terrorist organizations. There are a few terrorists who are truly self-radicalizing, but dig deeper into any given terror attack and the chances are you’ll find not just warning signs in the form of obvious inspiration from ISIS or other terror attacks, but also actual communication with terrorists abroad. In a brilliant piece of reporting last month, the New York Times’s Rukmini Callimachus detailed ISIS’s direction and enabling of terror attacks abroad from Syria, including attempted attacks on the United States. In other words, ((ul))((hl))while there might be some tiny number of terrorists who need no inspiration for terror beyond their own readings of the Koran((/hl))((/ul)) and the Hadith (along with deep rage or a sense of grievance springing from contemporary events), ((ul))((hl))for terrorism to be a significant threat, it needs not just a willing or potentially willing population but also a concrete source of inspiration and direction((/hl))((/ul))((hl)). ((/hl))((ul))((hl))The Trump administration’s strategy attacks the threat from both ends — limiting (for now) the growth of the potentially willing population through immigration restrictions and more-careful vetting while more aggressively attacking and destroying the source of inspiration and direction((/hl))((/ul)). This is the opposite of the strategy that prevailed during much of ((ul))((hl))the Obama administration((/hl))((/ul)), which ((ul))((hl))responded((/hl))((/ul)) to the explosive increase in jihadist violence and jihadist territorial gains in part ((ul))((hl))by opening our borders to more refugees and other immigrants from terror-wracked countries. The result was ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))more terror, more terror plots((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)), a larger population of potential terrorists at hom((/hl))((/ul))((ul))e((/ul)), and safe havens abroad that jihadists could use to plot and/or inspire more attacks((hl)). ((/hl))((ul))((hl))While any given terror attack is unpredictable, certain trends are clear. When you grant terrorists safe havens, and when they have a population to recruit from, terror plots happen. It’s that simple((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).((/hl)) It’s not enough for America to simply close its borders. As recent attacks have shown, there are already a number of Americans and legal immigrants who are vulnerable to ISIS or al-Qaeda recruitment. The safe havens have to fall. The recruiters and enablers have to be killed or captured, and those that aren’t have to be forced onto the run, so they’re more focused on living another day than on recruiting another terrorist.

The impact—any ISIS terror attack will prompt an over-reaction by Trump—he will strike blindly at Muslim targets, destabilizing the Middle East, and crack down on immigration, turning case.((/hl))","cite":"Daniel ((hl))Byman((/hl))((hl)),((/hl)) senior fellow at the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution, 5/2/((hl))2017((/hl))","text":["[“Trump and the Next Terrorist Attack,” Lawfare, https://lawfareblog.com/trump-and-next-terrorist-attack CBO DUDA]","((ul))((hl))The days after a terrorist attack are trying for any president. Initial reports of responsibility ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))are often wrong((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)), and the public response is a loud mix of fear((/hl))((/ul))((hl)),((/hl)) demonstrations of support for the victims, ((ul))and ((/ul))((ul))((hl))calls for revenge((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).((/hl)) Americans look to the president and his advisors for information on the scope and scale of the threat, and as the repositories of national security information, the presidents has a tremendous opportunity to control our national narrative. ((ul))((hl))As the cries grow ever louder, the president must show resolve and((/hl))((/ul)) reassure the American people that the U.S. will ((ul))((hl))respond effectively. At the same time, he must avoid overreacting((/hl))((/ul))((hl)). I worry that ((/hl))((ul))((hl))President Trump will bungle the response to a jihadist terrorist attack on U.S. soil((/hl))((/ul)), making the fear worse at home and helping the terrorists score a win. Although I’m on record saying that the terrorism danger to the U.S. homeland has so far proven manageable, some attacks are likely regardless of who occupies the Oval Office. Since September 11, 2001, 95 Americans have died from jihadist-linked attacks on U.S. soil—an average of almost six a y ear. Of course, we’ve seen near-misses like the 2009 “underwear bomber,” who was able to to slip a bomb through airport security. Especially with the rise of lone wolves, who are difficult to identify and disrupt, it is not realistic to expect the government to stop every terrorist attack. Finally, because of the steady success of the U.S.-led military campaign against the Islamic State, we should expect a rise in terrorism as the group seeks to demonstrate its relevance as it loses territory and prestige in the region. So we should recognize that some attacks are likely and, for Trump critics, that they are not inherently linked to who won the 2016 election. If and when it happens, it won’t prove anyone was right to vote for Hillary. Trump’s response, however, will tell us a great deal. The best response in the hours after an attack involves a mix of rhetoric, leadership, and caution. The President should publicly honor the dead and reassure Americans that the government is working to hunt down the guilty and care for those injured. At the same time, he should point out that American Muslims have proven vital allies against terrorism. As FBI Director James Comey put it, \"They do not want people committing violence, either in their community or in the name of their faith, and so some of our most productive relationships are with people who see things and tell us things who happen to be Muslim.” Almost half of all tips on extremism come from the community. ((ul))((hl))An immediate retaliatory strike—one that on its surface would signal toughness and thus be attractive to a president who talks about toughness a lot—might be a mistake. Initial information on responsibility or the extent of overseas links is often flawed or incomplet((/hl))((/ul))((ul))e((/ul)), and it is useful for the administration to assess a full range of options before plunging in. ((ul))((hl))Since the Trump administration is already hitting the Islamic State hard, it’s difficult to imagine an easy way to ratchet up the pressure that does not involve significant costs or downsides((/hl))((/ul)). Instead, various agencies should be scrutinizing intelligence and security procedures to determine culpability and identify real and potential holes while the military and intelligence agencies assess options overseas. Based on his initial record in office and rhetoric on the campaign trail, however, ((ul))((hl))Trump might opt for a disastrous approach. The President acts out of impulse((/hl))((/ul)), whether this involves sarcastic tweets to Arnold Schwartzenegger or the sudden decision to bomb Syria after the regime’s use of chemical weapons. It’s safe to say that ((ul))((hl))restraint and deliberation are not characteristics of this administration((/hl))((/ul))((ul))—or ((/ul))((ul))((hl))the man himself. Perhaps even worse, this administration has a track record of mismanaging policy processes((/hl))((/ul))((ul)).((/ul)) This includes signature items like the “Muslim Ban” executive order or less prominent but important announcements, like the supposed deployment of an aircraft carrier to Korea. This bungling and the President’s many about-faces on issues have damaged his credibility as a messenger and are likely to make people more skeptical of the content of his statements and actions in the aftermath of a terrorist attack. ((ul))((hl))The President is likely to want to overreact abroad. He seems to want to appear tough more than he wants to be effective((/hl))((/ul))((hl)).((/hl)) So he boasted, for example, about dropping a massive bomb on Islamic State targets in Afghanistan without waiting to learn whether it achieved its objectives. On the campaign trail, the President wanted to “bomb the shit out of them” even though it was not clear an increase in the scale of bombing would achieve much. ((ul))((hl))Trump might also expand the war, bringing it to new zones that have only a tenuous Islamic State or Al Qaeda presence. He has ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))already((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) authorized the intensification of US operations targeting ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))Shabaab((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) and ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))increased the pace of strikes((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl)) targeting terrorist groups more generally Even more worrisome is what the President might do at home((/hl))((/ul))((hl)). On the campaign trail, ((/hl))((ul))((hl))the President repeatedly conflated Muslims and terrorists, and with tensions and emotions running high after an attack this demonization might be especially likely. In the name of border security, he might further limit immigration((/hl))((/ul))((ul)) ((/ul))and travel from Muslim-majority countries or try to single out Muslims over other faith communities. He might embrace the decision to declare the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist group even though this would be counterproductive and cause difficulties with several allies. ((ul))((hl))Surveillance of Muslim communities around the country might be stepped up, further alienating Muslims from law enforcement and make them less likely to turn in suspected terrorist((/hl))((/ul))((hl))s((/hl)). After 9/11, the United States detained over one thousand Muslims, gaining almost no useful intelligence but harming relations with the community.

But the agency did more than just release the documents to the public. It provided advance copies to the foundation’s online publication, Long War Journal. (The C.I.A. said it was common practice to distribute declassified documents to the news media and academic organizations on an embargoed basis and that the only agenda in releasing these files was “to enhance public understanding” of Al Qaeda.) Long War Journal homed in on a 19-page document by an unidentified Qaeda official who claimed that the Iranian government had offered “Saudi brothers” in Al Qaeda “everything they needed,” including money, arms and training in Hezbollah camps in Lebanon, “in exchange for striking American interests in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf.” Yet the Iranian offer, admitted the official, was never accepted by Al Qaeda — if such an offer was in fact made. ((ul))((hl))The timing of these latest claims from the president((/hl))((/ul)) and his C.I.A. chief ((ul))((hl))are hardly coincidental. Tensions in the Middle East are ramping up.

Those claims of a nefarious alliance with Al Qaeda might help((/hl))((/ul)). The “bomb Iran” crowd has long pointed to the presence of senior Qaeda officials, including members of the Bin Laden family, inside Iran since late 2001. But Iran is far from being a base or command center for Al Qaeda. In 2001, after hundreds of Qaeda fighters crossed into Iran from Afghanistan fleeing American airstrikes, the Iranians deported most of them back to their countries of origin. In 2003, the Iranians offered to swap Qaeda members held under house arrest for members of Mujahedeen Khalq, a militant group that seeks to overthrow the Iranian government, who are being detained by American forces in Iraq. The relationship between the Salafi Sunnis of Al Qaeda and the Shiite clerics of Iran is “not one of alliance” but “highly antagonistic” and “largely based on indirect and unpleasant negotiations over the release of detained jihadis and their families, including members of Bin Ladin’s family,” according to a 2012 report by the Combating Terrorism Center at the United States Military Academy at West Point. The report said that Iran held onto senior Qaeda figures not to protect or assist them but to use them as bargaining chips with the United States and also as a deterrent against Qaeda attacks. When I asked terrorism experts what they made of the alleged Iran-Al Qaeda ties, they were unanimous in their incredulity. “I’ve never seen any evidence of active collaboration,” said Jason Burke, the author of an acclaimed book on Al Qaeda. Ali Soufan, a former F.B.I. agent and the author of the new book “Anatomy of Terror,” dismissed the coverage of the C.I.A.’s documents as an “oversimplification of the facts” and a result of “the Trump administration joining Saudi Arabia’s anti-Iran campaign.” Few would deny that Iran has sponsored groups listed by the United States as “foreign terrorist organizations,” such as Hamas and Hezbollah. But, say the experts, support for Al Qaeda is another matter altogether. As William McCants, a former American government adviser on extremism and author of a recent book on the Islamic State, put it, Iran and Al Qaeda “never embraced as lovers.” So far, none of the documents newly released by the C.I.A. contains a smoking gun. Have Iranian security forces and members of Al Qaeda had contacts, or done deals? Probably. Are there Qaeda figures still living in Iran? Almost definitely.

While al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and ISIS had a short flirtation last year, ISIS has now signaled its intent to usurp al-Qaeda’s power in its home territory. Attacks by ISIS last week against Shia mosques in the Yemeni capital of Sana’a were, at least in part, designed to suck recruits, financial donors, and prestige away from AQAP.

Of course, attacking America wouldn’t actually serve the Islamic State’s long-term objectives.

The strikes provoked no significant Russian reaction. ((ul))((hl))Last June, the US shot down a ((/hl))((/ul))((ul))((hl))Syrian warplane((/hl))((/ul)). It was the fourth time in a month that the US struck pro-Assad forces, and the first time the US brought down a Syrian military plane since the war’s start.

But tensions soon died down. “Russia and the US were able to iron out the dispute((/hl))((/ul)),” says Shanna Kirschner, a Syria expert at Allegheny College, “((ul))((hl))which strongly suggests neither side wanted to escalate at that time.” “But it’s not a given that continued casualties wouldn’t be a provocatio((/hl))((/ul))((ul))n((/ul)),” she added. That’s perhaps why Trump may use “smart bombs” to attack Syria, which he alluded to in his Wednesday morning tweet. Smart bombs, typically, can evade missile-defense systems and then precisely hit the target. They can help minimize any unintended casualties, like killing Russian soldiers, if they are near the target the US wants to strike. Experts believed the US will work with Russia to avoid that outcome. “I suspect that we’ll be communicating with them,” Faysal Itani, a Syria expert at the Atlantic Council think tank, told me before the strikes. There’s also a political element to this. Trump wants closer ties with Moscow, and even tweeted on Wednesday — right after his missile attack threat — about why the US and Russia should work more in tandem. It’s therefore hard to believe he would imperil the US-Russia relationship by targeting Russian troops during Syria strikes. Russian President Vladimir Putin may not be as concerned with improving Moscow’s relations with Washington, but he also doesn’t want a war, says Kirschner.
